Ann Perkins,Hi.,1,1
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann Perkins.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Excellent.,1,1
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a good idea.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Tell us about that.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"No, it's a problem.",1,1
Ann Perkins,It almost killed my boyfriend.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Oh.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Twelve months, yes.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Go on.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"Ann, let me speak with you for a minute.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?",1,1
Ann Perkins,Yes.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"And, this guy, is it pretty serious?",1,1
Tom Haverford,Are you guys living together?,1,1
Ann Perkins,Yes.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken.",1,1
Tom Haverford,He's just weak.,1,1
Tom Haverford,You have to take care of him.,1,1
Tom Haverford,You probably feel like you need to move on.,1,1
Ann Perkins,What does this--,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in",1,1
Ann Perkins,Are you actually hitting on me right now?,1,1
Tom Haverford,Oh.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Oh.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"God, no.",1,1
Tom Haverford,I'm not hitting on you.,1,1
Tom Haverford,I'm actually married.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women.",1,1
Tom Haverford,I've spent a lot of time with them.,1,1
Tom Haverford,And I just-- I don't know.,1,1
Tom Haverford,I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Maybe we can just exchange numbers.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this.",1,1
Ann Perkins,Look --,1,1
Tom Haverford,I'd love to do it.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government owned, and you need to do something about it.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Okay.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I'll do something about it.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Really?,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we-- I will help you.",1,1
Ann Perkins,Is that a promise?,1,1
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.,1,1
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land.",1,1
Ann Perkins,Okay.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"No, that sounds great.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"Problem is, anything over 25 dollars I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Morning.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"All right, Mr. Mayor.",1,1
Tom Haverford,That sounds good.,1,1
Tom Haverford,I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Bye.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, hello.",1,1
Leslie Knope,You were talking to the mayor?,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Yep, we were just rapping about some things.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Tom and I work really well together.,1,1
Leslie Knope,We're both outsiders.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"I'm a woman, he's a... I think he's a Libyan.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina.",1,1
Tom Haverford,I am what you might call a redneck.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, brainstorm.",1,1
Leslie Knope,How do we make this park happen?,1,1
Tom Haverford,Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"No, parks are not a priority.",1,1
Leslie Knope,I need more firepower.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I need bigger guns.,1,1
Leslie Knope,You know what I need to do?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Form a committee.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Right?,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, that could work.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.,1,1
Leslie Knope,That's really good.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Write that down.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Yep.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down.",1,1
Leslie Knope,He's collecting them for my memoirs.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, read it back to me.",1,1
Tom Haverford,"Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood.""",1,1
Leslie Knope,Hmm.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Sounded better when I said it.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"It's still good, though.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea.",1,1
Leslie Knope,What about bringing Mark on board?,1,1
Tom Haverford,Which Mark?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that.",1,1
Leslie Knope,He's kind of like a fixer.,1,1
Leslie Knope,He fixes things.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"He's a smart, capable guy.",1,1
Leslie Knope,He just-- He knows where the bodies are buried.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Brendanawicz?",1,1
Leslie Knope,You crazy old Polish person.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you... Then you can't take it.",1,1
Leslie Knope,You gotta leave the locker room.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Let's get down to brass tacks.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I just work right there.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I didn't clear anything.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, Lot 48.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Condo developer.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I checked it out like a month ago.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,It's pretty gross.,1,1
Leslie Knope,What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"A park, huh?",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, it's not likely, you know.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"But, is it possible?",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not possible.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I would give up on that one.,1,1
Leslie Knope,What?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Why?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Why?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,There's like a million reasons why.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape--",1,1
Leslie Knope,Really?,1,1
Leslie Knope,It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no way it can happen.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I can do this.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I just need a little help.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?",1,1
Leslie Knope,Mark and I-- It's complicated.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen.",1,1
Leslie Knope,We slept together.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did, like, five years ago.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"I sort of-- No, but yeah.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did.",1,1
Ann Perkins,"Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?",1,1
Ann Perkins,'Cause they're gonna be here soon.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Can-- Thanks.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit.",1,1
Ann Perkins,I think it's probably just a photo op for her.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about--",1,1
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?",1,1
Andy Dwyer,I'm trying to watch TV.,1,1
Ann Perkins,I'm talking about the pit you fell in.,1,1
Leslie Knope,It's Ms. Perkins' house.,1,1
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!,1,1
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I heard it.",1,1
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!,1,1
Ann Perkins,I heard it.,1,1
Ann Perkins,I'm getting it.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I'm here.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Hey!,1,1
Ann Perkins,Wow!,1,1
Ann Perkins,Look at that.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Safety.,1,1
Leslie Knope,You remember Tom from last night.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ann, how are you?",1,1
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, hey.",1,1
Ann Perkins,Of course I do.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"And this is our college intern, April.",1,1
Leslie Knope,She's going to be documenting our fact finding mission.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April.",1,1
April Ludgate,Hey.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Is this fun for you?,1,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's so much fun.",1,1
Ann Perkins,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Sorry.,1,1
Leslie Knope,This must be our hero.,1,1
Leslie Knope,The man heard 'round the world.,1,1
Andy Dwyer,Uh-huh.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"How you doing, son?",1,1
Andy Dwyer,Pretty good.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.,1,1
Leslie Knope,And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.,1,1
Andy Dwyer,Could you pass me my itch stick?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Of course.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"So, Andy jumped over this fence.",1,1
Ann Perkins,"He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",1,1
Leslie Knope,How did we let this happen?,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Dream with me for a second, Ann.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field.",1,1
Leslie Knope,We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.,1,1
Ann Perkins,It's really not that big of a pit.,1,1
Leslie Knope,We could do some of those things.,1,1
Leslie Knope,It's gonna take a little extra work.,1,1
Leslie Knope,But why not try?,1,1
Ann Perkins,I think that would be great.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Me, too.",1,1
Leslie Knope,I'm going in.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Why?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I have a hard hat on.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"I can see that, but--",1,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"April, document this.",1,1
April Ludgate,Document what?,1,1
Leslie Knope,"The key to any factfinding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?",1,1
Leslie Knope,It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.,1,1
Leslie Knope,No!,1,1
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, are you okay?",1,1
Tom Haverford,Leslie!,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website.",1,1
April Ludgate,Could you just be still?,1,1
Tom Haverford,Don't move around as much.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"Okay, squeeze my fingers.",1,1
Ann Perkins,Good.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Does it hurt a lot?,1,1
Leslie Knope,No.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Mmmmmm.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"No, you're not.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.,1,1
Ann Perkins,But it-- It fell off.,1,1
Leslie Knope,After my head hit that rod.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Wow.,1,1
Andy Dwyer,"I can't believe you fell in, too.",1,1
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"It's not awesome, Andy.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle.",1,1
Ann Perkins,It's not broken.,1,1
Leslie Knope,It is.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?,1,1
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, you're fine.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, my clavicle's broken.",1,1
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?",1,1
Ann Perkins,Sure.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Ooh!,1,1
Leslie Knope,Are pancakes being made?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Sure.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please.",1,1
Ron Swanson,No.,1,1
Ron Swanson,No way.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron.",1,1
Leslie Knope,I've been a loyal foot soldier.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Give me my shot.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Let me have Lot 48.,1,1
Ron Swanson,Is that a travel pillow around your neck?,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you.",1,1
Leslie Knope,When you've been down in the pit-- Have you been in the pit?,1,1
Ron Swanson,"No, I haven't gotten down there yet.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have.",1,1
Ron Swanson,When you fell in.,1,1
Leslie Knope,When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact finding mission.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"And let me tell you something, Ron.",1,1
Leslie Knope,What it means is I want this subcommittee.,1,1
Ron Swanson,I've been quite open about this around the office.,1,1
Ron Swanson,I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.,1,1
Ron Swanson,I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.,1,1
Ron Swanson,My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.,1,1
Ron Swanson,Like Chuck E. Cheese.,1,1
Ron Swanson,They have an impeccable business model.,1,1
Ron Swanson,I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.,1,1
Ron Swanson,"Well, I will definitely think about it.",1,1
Leslie Knope,I like the sound of that definitely.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, I presume.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Lot 46 thoughts? Yes? No? Me? Park?,1,1
Leslie Knope,Giving the park to me?,1,1
Ron Swanson,Still mulling.,1,1
Ron Swanson,She's insatiable.,1,1
Ron Swanson,She's like a little dog with a chew toy.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"All right, you guys.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"All right, all right.",1,1
Leslie Knope,I'll ask him.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Everybody wants to know what your decision is.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Someone on the phone about the park.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't think I even want it.",1,1
Leslie Knope,Oh man.,1,1
Leslie Knope,My clavicle's still really hurting me.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Oh!,1,1
Tom Haverford,This is a great shot.,1,1
April Ludgate,I know.,1,1
Tom Haverford,That's awesome.,1,1
April Ludgate,I think she's crying in that one.,1,1
April Ludgate,Look at this one.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, kids.",1,1
Tom Haverford,That's another good one.,1,1
April Ludgate,Hey.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Brendanawicz.",1,1
Tom Haverford,You gotta come check this out.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside.",1,1
Tom Haverford,And we have some awesome photos.,1,1
April Ludgate,One.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Is she okay?,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, she's fine.",1,1
Tom Haverford,Oh! This is a classic.,1,1
April Ludgate,That's the best one.,1,1
Tom Haverford,The up-skirt photo.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Awesome.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man.",1,1
Tom Haverford,Give me the photo back.,1,1
Tom Haverford,What's going on?,1,1
April Ludgate,Don't worry.,1,1
April Ludgate,I can print more.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie is unique.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Government work can beat you down.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie's kept hers for six years.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules.",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.,1,1
Ron Swanson,Why should I?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"You owe me one, remember?",1,1
Ron Swanson,Do you want to cash in for this?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I do.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"So this was built in 1935, it's called Pioneer Hall. And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks.",1,1
Ann Perkins,Wow!,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah.",1,1
Leslie Knope,This is our crown jewel.,1,1
Leslie Knope,It's one of our best murals.,1,1
Leslie Knope,It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.",1,1
Ann Perkins,That is horrifying.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is.",1,1
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could--",1,1
Tom Haverford,Leslie! We did it.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Ron's approved our committee.,1,1
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",1,1
Leslie Knope,That's great!,1,1
Ann Perkins,That's so great.,1,1
Leslie Knope,That's so exciting! This is huge.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee.",1,1
Leslie Knope,I'm a rocket ship.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I just heard the news.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Hey.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Isn't it great?,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Congratulations.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,1,1
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"It's exciting, isn't it?",1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,It is.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,1,1
Leslie Knope,"Should I call a press conference now, or--",1,1
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, call one.",1,1
Tom Haverford,Definitely.,1,1
Mark Brendanawicz,I would.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered.",1,1
Tom Haverford,One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.,1,1
Tom Haverford,She one time made out with the water delivery guy in her office.,1,1
Tom Haverford,"On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman.",1,1
Tom Haverford,Not Batgirl.,1,1
Tom Haverford,Batman.,1,1
Tom Haverford,And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.,1,1
Tom Haverford,And it is my favorite thing in the world.,1,1
Leslie Knope,You know what?,1,1
Leslie Knope,America is awesome.,1,1
Leslie Knope,It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.,1,1
Leslie Knope,You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,1
Leslie Knope,You gotta be ready for it.,1,1
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,1
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?,1,1
Ann Perkins,Definitely am.,1,1

Leslie Knope,"If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want.",1,2
Ann Perkins,"""Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?""",1,2

Leslie Knope,"Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up.",1,2
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what I mean.",1,2

Leslie Knope,I need to be accessible.,1,2
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with people?,1,2
Ann Perkins,I should show them Andy's medical bills.,1,2
Ann Perkins,Maybe they'd have a little sympathy.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",1,2
Leslie Knope,Ann!,1,2
Leslie Knope,Game changer.,1,2
Leslie Knope,You just busted the game wide open.,1,2

Ron Swanson,It's horrifying.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a nurse's costume?",1,2

Andy Dwyer,And I'm sleeping with my clothes on I came in through the window last night,1,2
Mark Brendanawicz,It can be tricky dealing,1,2
Leslie Knope,Don't-- Why do I want to build this park so bad?,1,2
Leslie Knope,Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"""Hey, Vlad! Look at these rocks! Let's pretend they're potatoes!""",1,2
Leslie Knope,"""Nikolai! Do you want to swim in the dirt?""",1,2
Leslie Knope,But not here.,1,2

Ron Swanson,"And together, we have decided to fast-track your project.",1,2
Leslie Knope,City manager?,1,2
Leslie Knope,Wow.,1,2

Leslie Knope,I doubt it.,1,2
Leslie Knope,It's a very breathable fabric--,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah.",1,2
Leslie Knope,I am.,1,2

Tom Haverford,"I was like, ""Man, that fence looks awesome.""",1,2
Tom Haverford,"I was like, of course, Roy's.",1,2
Tom Haverford,"If you're into chocolate muffins, grab as many you want.",1,2
Tom Haverford,Some people may say that bringing in these contractors this early is jumping the gun a little bit.,1,2
Tom Haverford,"Well, guess what?",1,2
Tom Haverford,"Here's the gun, here's me.",1,2
Tom Haverford,Boom!,1,2
Tom Haverford,Victor Miles.,1,2

Lawrence,"Yeah, I have birds.",1,2
Lawrence,"I have nice, pretty, expensive birds, and you play that music, and it wakes them up.",1,2
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I don't work for the government, okay? Uh, I do play rock and roll.",1,2
Andy Dwyer,Guilty as charged.,1,2
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a band.,1,2
Andy Dwyer,It's called Just the Tip.,1,2
Andy Dwyer,"And actually, if anyone here plays bass, we need a bassist.",1,2
Leslie Knope,Yes.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we?",1,2
Ron Swanson,Uh.,1,2
Ron Swanson,It is not going well at all.,1,2
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.,1,2
Ron Swanson,It's going very poorly.,1,2
Ron Swanson,Okay?,1,2
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.,1,2
Ron Swanson,"Like, you're crashing and burning.",1,2
Leslie Knope,Democracy's happening.,1,2
Leslie Knope,People are talking.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right?",1,2
Ron Swanson,You're right about that.,1,2
Ron Swanson,They're deeply negative.,1,2
Ron Swanson,"You need to put a happy face on this, give me a few positive talking points, and whatever you do, avoid a vote.",1,2
Tom Haverford,I'm oddly attracted to Kate Spivack.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death.",1,2
Leslie Knope,Flash forward to 1969.,1,2
Leslie Knope,Man walks on the moon.,1,2
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is lousy with hippies--,1,2
Paul,"My, God.",1,2
Paul,She's filibustering her own meeting.,1,2
Leslie Knope,Filibuster! Boom! They can't touch you if you talk forever.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"I can't speak of the future, but I will.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster.",1,2
Kate Spivack,Excuse me? Can't you read that children's book on your own time?,1,2
Leslie Knope,"I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but""",1,2
Kate Spivack,"Okay, all right.",1,2
Kate Spivack,"You know what? This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"Well, you did already talk, ma'am.",1,2
Leslie Knope,And I would love to listen to someone else.,1,2
Leslie Knope,Someone I don't know.,1,2
Leslie Knope,Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.,1,2
Leslie Knope,Could you tell us how you feel about this park? Go ahead.,1,2
April Ludgate,Hi.,1,2
April Ludgate,"Uh, I'm a youth in the community and I think a new park is a great idea.",1,2
April Ludgate,"And I fully support it, as would the rest of the youth in the community.",1,2
Lawrence,Hey! I recognize her.,1,2
Lawrence,That kid came to my door yesterday.,1,2
Kate Spivack,"Oh, my God! Okay, they have planted people in this audience.",1,2
Kate Spivack,Unbelievable! You know what? We all agree that this park is a bad idea.,1,2
Kate Spivack,We should just take a vote.,1,2
Kate Spivack,Right? Yeah.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we will take a vote.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you.",1,2
Leslie Knope,One by one.,1,2
Ann Perkins,That was brutal.,1,2
Ann Perkins,"A couple of weeks ago, I was yelling at Leslie at a public forum.",1,2
Ann Perkins,"God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious as those people.",1,2
Ann Perkins,"I wasn't, right?",1,2
Extra,"At 5:00 in the morning, every morning, beep, beep, beep! I don't want to hear that.",1,2
Extra,"Now, how long is this project gonna take? That's what I want to know.",1,2
Extra,That's what's important to me.,1,2
Extra,Because I need my sleep.,1,2
Extra,I put some,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am.",1,2
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am.",1,2
Leslie Knope,That concludes our meeting.,1,2
Kate Spivack,What about the vote?,1,2
Leslie Knope,We're out of time.,1,2
Leslie Knope,It's 9 o' clock.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there.",1,2
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.,1,2
Leslie Knope,It was tough.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, that's Pawnee.",1,2
Leslie Knope,That's democracy.,1,2
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of people here that want this park.,1,2
Leslie Knope,You just gotta get past the negative people.,1,2
Leslie Knope,But guess what? My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"God, I loved it! I loved every minute of it.",1,2
Lawrence,"Hey, park lady.",1,2
Leslie Knope,Yeah?,1,2
Lawrence,You suck.,1,2
Leslie Knope,"Hear that? He called me ""park lady.""",1,2
Tom Haverford,"You know, normally, I don't agree with Leslie about anything, but this book is awesome.",1,2

Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now, see, here's a good example of a plant that you can't eat.",1,3
Jerry Gergich,See all the spikes?,1,3
Jerry Gergich,"So, two things.",1,3
Jerry Gergich,"One, it's poisonous.",1,3
Jerry Gergich,"And two, it would hurt.",1,3
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department has so many programs.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant.",1,3
Jerry Gergich,"Look what we have here, country honeysuckle, Pawnee style.",1,3
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, take a look at that.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Wow.,1,3
Jerry Gergich,It's pretty and it smells good.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Mmm.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Smells great.,1,3
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, it's really nice.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Mmm.,1,3
Leslie Knope,That's bitter.,1,3
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you don't eat it.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Oh!,1,3
Leslie Knope,Why did you let me eat that?,1,3
Jerry Gergich,I never told you to eat that.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Oh!,1,3
Leslie Knope,God.,1,3
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, the animals know you don't eat the country honeysuckle.",1,3
Leslie Knope,I'm not an animal.,1,3
Leslie Knope,My tongue is swelling up.,1,3
Jerry Gergich,"No, don't touch it!",1,3
Jerry Gergich,"No, you can't-- Okay, now you'll have to throw that away.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Let's not scare the kids.,1,3
Jerry Gergich,Okay.,1,3
Leslie Knope,All right.,1,3
Leslie Knope,All right.,1,3
Jerry Gergich,"Well, there we go then.",1,3
Jerry Gergich,Let's see what else is here.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though.",1,3
Leslie Knope,So I have a piece of good news.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post.",1,3
Ann Perkins,That sounds really good.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ann.",1,3
Leslie Knope,It is a classic strategy.,1,3
Leslie Knope,The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project.",1,3
Leslie Knope,The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.",1,3
Leslie Knope,One penis in particular.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Rule number one, stay on message.",1,3
Leslie Knope,This is key.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park.",1,3
Leslie Knope,And that's it.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Okay?,1,3
Leslie Knope,Number two: What?,1,3
Leslie Knope,Stay on message again?,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's that important.",1,3
Leslie Knope,It's one and two.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Stay on message and stay on message.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Right?,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Stay on what, Ann?",1,3
Ann Perkins,Message.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Great.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week, which is really impressive.",1,3
Ann Perkins,"I mean, until now, my only experience with government was trying to get a recycling bin.",1,3
Ann Perkins,Wait.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Did I ever get it?,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Leslie.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark?",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Buy you a cup of coffee?,1,3
Leslie Knope,"This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial meeting place of Pawnee's political elite.",1,3
Leslie Knope,The people who eat here basically run this town.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"So, listen, I was hoping maybe I could pick your brain about how to deal with the media.",1,3
Leslie Knope,It's my first interview.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,What about that thing you did for the middle school newspaper last year?,1,3
Leslie Knope,Oh.,1,3
Leslie Knope,No.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I don't count that.,1,3
Leslie Knope,That was a smear job.,1,3
Leslie Knope,So I put together some discussion topics.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Can I run them by you?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,1,3
Leslie Knope,What do you think her opening gambit is gonna be?,1,3
Leslie Knope,What is she gonna ask me first?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,How you spell your name.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Of course.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Because of the silent ""K.""",1,3
Leslie Knope,You're so smart.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building--",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,How many discussion questions do you have there?,1,3
Leslie Knope,Um Thirty.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow!,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,You're insane.,1,3
Leslie Knope,You're insane.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Mark and I made love once.,1,3
Leslie Knope,And it was very intense.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, I'm looking for Leslie Knope.",1,3
April Ludgate,Okay.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Oh!,1,3
Leslie Knope,My ears are ringing.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Hi.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I'm the deputy director of Parks and Recreation.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Shauna.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Malwae-Tweep.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am familiar with your work.",1,3
Leslie Knope,I've read everything you've ever written.,1,3
Leslie Knope,You did an amazing in-depth article on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Who left the door open?,1,3
Leslie Knope,No!,1,3
Leslie Knope,No!,1,3
Leslie Knope,No!,1,3
Leslie Knope,And I agree with you.,1,3
Leslie Knope,They are nature's bandits.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Thanks.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I was happy with that line.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"So, can I give you a quick tour before we get started?",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I've been here before.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A few times.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Quick tour?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.,1,3
Leslie Knope,So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"And this is called ""The trial of Chief Wamapo.""",1,3
Leslie Knope,It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I am always amazed at his quiet dignity right before he's killed by a cannonball.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm surprised no one's complained about this.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, tons of people have.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we get letters every day.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"This is Ron Swanson, our boss.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is the reporter I was telling you about.",1,3
Ron Swanson,No comment.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,About what?,1,3
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Haverford, maybe one day you'll figure out how to spell a three letter word.",1,3
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ron.",1,3
Tom Haverford,"I play a lot of online Scrabble with my boss, Ron Swanson, and, oh, my God, that guy is the best.",1,3
Tom Haverford,He beats me every time.,1,3
Tom Haverford,He kills me.,1,3
Tom Haverford,He's awesome.,1,3
Tom Haverford,I can't beat him.,1,3
Tom Haverford,I should just close my account.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, Shauna, this is our crack team.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, everyone.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford, boy genius.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Smooth like milk chocolate.,1,3
Tom Haverford,That's a weird way to describe me.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"April Ludgate, 19.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Cool enough to be invited anywhere and chooses to be here.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer.",1,3
Leslie Knope,They're the real heroes of this story.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Ann was the citizen who brought the pit to our attention.,1,3
Leslie Knope,And Andy is the citizen who fell in it.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"It's cool if I record this, right?",1,3
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Good.,1,3
Leslie Knope,That way it's verbatim.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Leslie, you're in charge of the committee.",1,3
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"It's actually called a subcommittee, not a committee, so.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,We can do all this on tape.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Right.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Sure we can.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"And this is where you meet, generally?",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Really?,1,3
Leslie Knope,We meet at a bunch of different places.,1,3
Leslie Knope,We don't always meet here.,1,3
Leslie Knope,So I didn't quite know how to answer that.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, why don't I ask the rest of your team some questions and then we will come back to you later?",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great.",1,3
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Because these are the real heroes.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna be in my office.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Andy, tell me about the night you fell into the pit.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,Oh.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,That's actually a great story.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,"I just finished up a gig with my band Three Skin, formerly Four Skin, but our bassist left for personal reasons.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,"And I was taking a shortcut home, and I thought I saw a toaster lying in the pit.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,"And I was like, ""Maybe I should get that.""",1,3
Andy Dwyer,And I fell in and broke my legs.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Such a tragedy.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why would you want a toaster that's lying at the bottom of the pit?,1,3
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,I was pretty wasted.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Wait.,1,3
Ann Perkins,You were drunk?,1,3
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,Totally.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,You knew that.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"I didn't know that, no.",1,3
Ann Perkins,"You should've told me, because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,I was probably not thinking 'cause I had two broken femurs and I was blackout drunk.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I just I can't believe I'm just finding this out right now.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,Like you're perfect.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,You're on the pill.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,You drink all the time.,1,3
Ann Perkins,You're allowed to do that.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Stay on message.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for bringing that up in front of a reporter.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's not that bad, right?",1,3
Ann Perkins,"I mean, why don't we just go back in there and talk about the park?",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann.",1,3
Leslie Knope,You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"The press are like sharks, and you guys just dumped a bucket of chum in the water.",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, I just got your 15 texts.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Mark.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Listen, thank you for coming.",1,3
Leslie Knope,I tried to stay on message.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Mmmhmm.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.,1,3
Leslie Knope,And it turns out that Ann is on birth control pills.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Shauna is in the conference room, and she's writing a really bad article and it's gonna destroy us all.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Please fix it.,1,3
Tom Haverford,"April, let me ask you something.",1,3
Tom Haverford,Do you think I'm in the top five best looking Indian guys in Pawnee?,1,3
April Ludgate,No.,1,3
Tom Haverford,Who do you think's got me beat?,1,3
Tom Haverford,That guy Hashish at City Planning?,1,3
Ron Swanson,Tommy boy.,1,3
Ron Swanson,"Let me tell you something, Tom.",1,3
Ron Swanson,You suck at Scrabble.,1,3
Tom Haverford,I know.,1,3
Tom Haverford,You're destroying me.,1,3
Ron Swanson,"You're worse than my exwife, and she's terrible at Scrabble.",1,3
Ron Swanson,And she's a bitch.,1,3
Tom Haverford,"Look out, man.",1,3
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna get you one of these days.,1,3
Tom Haverford,I'm practicing.,1,3
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I doubt that.",1,3
Ron Swanson,Her name is Tammy Swanson and she's a serious bitch.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Leslie.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I have to go.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Let's do the interview tomorrow morning at the pit.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Perfect.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Great.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll have a photographer meet us there.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Okay.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Great.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,See you then.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Disaster averted.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"That was easy, right?",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Can we go in your car?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,All right.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,'Cause I hate driving.,1,3
Leslie Knope,There's a beautiful view from over there.,1,3
Leslie Knope,This is a great place to take a shot.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Over there as well, so I think you're fine.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi!,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry I'm late.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no problem.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Do you live near Mark?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"No, not at all.",1,3
Leslie Knope,So he gave you a ride somehow?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"You know, do you have a pen?",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Cause I don't--,1,3
Leslie Knope,"No, sorry.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Michael, do you have any paper I could borrow?",1,3
Extra,"I might, yeah.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to complain, but I think Shauna is being a little unprofessional.",1,3
Leslie Knope,She got here 15 minutes late. She's wearing the same dress she wore yesterday.,1,3
Leslie Knope,And she had to get a ride from--,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So how big is this lot?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, how big is--",1,3
Leslie Knope,What?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,How big is the lot?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The lot?,1,3
Leslie Knope,How big is what?,1,3
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,1,3
Leslie Knope,You tell me.,1,3
Leslie Knope,How big is the lot?,1,3
Leslie Knope,A hundred or something.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Give or take 100.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A hundred what?,1,3
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Shauna Malwae-Tweep.",1,3
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I don't I guess I don't know anything.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you okay?,1,3
Leslie Knope,I have to get something from my car.,1,3
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?,1,3
April Ludgate,Kicking Ron's butt at Scrabble.,1,3
April Ludgate,"I just played ""lexicons"" for a billion points.",1,3
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no, no.",1,3
April Ludgate,What?,1,3
Tom Haverford,"I was letting him win, dumbass.",1,3
April Ludgate,Whatever.,1,3
Tom Haverford,Oh.,1,3
Tom Haverford,Come on.,1,3
Tom Haverford,"""Lateral, communal, zonal""?",1,3
Tom Haverford,"You dropped a ""Z"" in there?",1,3
Tom Haverford,April.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So when did you start at the Parks Department?,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was a few years ago.",1,3
Leslie Knope,My mother got me the job.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I was qualified.,1,3
Leslie Knope,It's not like it was nepotism.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Crap on a stick.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"But-- Oh, my God.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"No, it wasn't.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's not you.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just I'm exhausted.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I got, like, zero sleep last night.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So--,1,3
Leslie Knope,Oh.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Hey!,1,3
Leslie Knope,You're home.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm home.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"I was doing an interview at the pit, and it was going really well.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was going perfect.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?",1,3
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Great.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Come on in.,1,3
Ann Perkins,So how'd it go?,1,3
Ann Perkins,"She didn't ask about Andy being drunk, did she?",1,3
Leslie Knope,Oh.,1,3
Leslie Knope,No.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"No, just your kind of standard questions.",1,3
Leslie Knope,There was one annoying thing.,1,3
Leslie Knope,She and Mark had sex with each other.,1,3
Ann Perkins,You're kidding.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"I wish I was, but I'm not.",1,3
Leslie Knope,They did it.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep and Mark Brendanawicz had sex with each other last night.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,Who had sex?,1,3
Ann Perkins,That guy Mark and the reporter.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,Called it.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,I called that.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,You remember that?,1,3
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"He did, actually.",1,3
Ann Perkins,He totally called that.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Why do men have to behave like this?,1,3
Leslie Knope,Why can't they be professionals?,1,3
Andy Dwyer,Men are dogs.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"You know, maybe they really like each other.",1,3
Leslie Knope,He doesn't like her.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,He was probably thinking with the head of his wiener instead of the head of his brain.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Oh.,1,3
Ann Perkins,God.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Andy, come on.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,Men do that.,1,3
Andy Dwyer,It's disgusting.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should go talk to him.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Make sure that he didn't say anything to hurt the project.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Definitely, you should talk to him.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann.",1,3
Andy Dwyer,I bet he didn't use a condom.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Andy, God!",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mark.",1,3
Leslie Knope,May I come into your office?,1,3
Leslie Knope,I need to speak with you about something very sensitive.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Something's come to my attention that requires your attention.,1,3
Leslie Knope,It has come to my attention that you had sex with Ms. Malwae-Tweep.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,That's personal.,1,3
Leslie Knope,It's unethical and it's irresponsible for a public servant to have sex with a member of the press corps.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have sex with her and",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm gonna say something.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't want you to take it the wrong way.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,But you're being a huge dork.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee.",1,3

Leslie Knope,Maybe over lunch.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I'm buying.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, I guess I'm free.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm assuming not Mexican.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Why?,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Because of the burrito.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Oh!,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it wasn't a Mexican burrito.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you sure that's the best thing for you right now?,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the best thing on the menu.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"So, look, I feel like I may have gone a little off message at the pit.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, you seemed a little weird.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wouldn't say weird.",1,3
Leslie Knope,"It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made?,1,3
Leslie Knope,Can I say over 100%?,1,3
Leslie Knope,Because I would be lying if I said less.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Wow.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You seem a lot more confident than some of the other people I've spoken to.,1,3

Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Hey, you should write an article on unicorns, because they're more likely to exist than this park.""",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?",1,3
Leslie Knope,Tell that to a 14 year old girl.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on the Pope getting married, because that's more likely to happen than this park.""",1,3
Leslie Knope,There are some countries where the Pope can be married.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on talking monkeys.""",1,3

Ann Perkins,Hey.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Can I talk to you for a second?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, what's up?",1,3
Ann Perkins,You and I need to find a way to fix this reporter thing.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Why is this a big deal to anybody?,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Well, apparently, the reporter is gonna print everything you said to her.",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,But I didn't say anything to her.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"""The park is never, ever, ever, ever getting built?""",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,But that stuff was off the record.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Did you say it was off the record?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you have to say it's off the record?,1,3
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God.",1,3
Ann Perkins,Hey.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for meeting us.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Mark.",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh I heard that you were gonna print some of that stuff that I said in private about the park.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, yeah.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,My editor loves it.,1,3
Ann Perkins,"You know, we'd really appreciate it if you didn't print that stuff 'cause we're trying to build this park--",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't understand.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"You did say it, right?",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Technically.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Technically?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you know, you got up because you had to write the article and I said, ""Come on, stay in bed.""",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"""That park is never, ever, ever gonna get made.""",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Right.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,And then I came back to bed.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, but the important part of what I said was, ""Stay in bed.""",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I would've said anything at that point if I thought it would make you stay in bed.",1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, well, since we're, you know, romantically involved, I won't print any of it.",1,3
Ann Perkins,That's great.,1,3
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.,1,3
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You're welcome.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I wouldn't say romantically involved.",1,3

Ron Swanson,He doesn't do a lot of work around here.,1,3
Ron Swanson,He shows zero initiative.,1,3
Ron Swanson,He's not a team player.,1,3
Ron Swanson,He's never one to go that extra mile.,1,3
Ron Swanson,Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government employee.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, you busy?",1,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics for the Pawnee Journal, so, yeah, I'm a little busy.",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,I wanted to apologize to you.,1,3
Leslie Knope,Really?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,I never should've done anything with that reporter.,1,3
Tom Haverford,Whoa! You nailed Malwae-Tweep? Nice.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, but I'm not gonna do it again.",1,3
Leslie Knope,It's over.,1,3
Tom Haverford,So she's available.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,I really did think that that stuff that I said was off the record.,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,"But you were right, and I should've listened to you.",1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,I tried to get her to pull some of those quotes and things got a little dicey.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate you trying.",1,3
Leslie Knope,Would you like to be reinstated onto our subcommittee?,1,3
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.,1,3
Leslie Knope,You'll have my answer within the month.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"Mark, can I ask you a question? You didn't really believe it when you said that the park was never gonna get made, right?",1,3

Leslie Knope,"""An abandoned lot on Sullivan Street has been proposed as the site of a new park.""",1,3
Leslie Knope,That part's good.,1,3
Leslie Knope,I think we stayed on message for that part.,1,3
Leslie Knope,And then it gets a little unpleasant.,1,3
Leslie Knope,"""Pretty drunk, Ann's on the pill.""",1,3
Leslie Knope,"I didn't ""throw up,"" I spit up.",1,3
Leslie Knope,JJ's Diner gets a nice mention.,1,3

Leslie Knope,Why can't I look away?,1,4
Ron Swanson,Let's not blow this out of proportion.,1,4
Leslie Knope,I will blow this in proportion!,1,4
Leslie Knope,The minimum punishment for this is an official reprimand from the city manager.,1,4
Ron Swanson,It's not that big a deal.,1,4
Leslie Knope,Maybe in your world it isn't a big deal.,1,4
Leslie Knope,"You're a white Protestant man with a full, rich mustache.",1,4

Andy Dwyer,"I wish I could say some of this mess was Ann's, but it's all mine.",1,4
Andy Dwyer,I'm kind of a nester.,1,4
Andy Dwyer,Huh?,1,4
Andy Dwyer,Not bad for a guy with two broken legs.,1,4

Ron Swanson,Don't worry about it.,1,4
Ron Swanson,"No, I didn't do it for Leslie.",1,4
Ron Swanson,I did it because I hate bureaucracy.,1,4
Ron Swanson,"My idea of a perfect government is one guy, who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke.",1,4
Ron Swanson,"The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon.",1,4
Ron Swanson,"And women are brought to him, maybe, when he desires them.",1,4
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann.",1,4
Leslie Knope,You're here.,1,4
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I came from the hospital.",1,4

Ann Perkins,"Oh, God.",1,4
Leslie Knope,I never should have opened that stupid basket.,1,4
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,4
Ann Perkins,Why did you open that basket? It doesn't really seem like you.,1,4
Leslie Knope,I think it's 'cause I wanted to shatter the glass ceiling.,1,4
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean? And just kind of infiltrate the boys' club.,1,4
Ann Perkins,Hmm.,1,4
Leslie Knope,I did it for a guy.,1,4

Leslie Knope,They cut his face off.,1,5
Leslie Knope,And they made it into a dream catcher.,1,5
Leslie Knope,And they made his legs into rain sticks.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer.",1,5
Leslie Knope,Today is a great day for the Knope family.,1,5
Leslie Knope,My mother is being honored at a banquet with the Tellenson Award for Excellence in Pawnee Public Service.,1,5

Marlene Griggs-Knope,You keep that up and you're gonna be figuring out what wall to put your own Tellenson Award on.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I already know, the one on the left where the American flag is.",1,5
Leslie Knope,"But I think we could be a multigenerational political dynasty, you and I, you know?",1,5
Leslie Knope,"Like the Kennedys, or the Bushes.",1,5
Leslie Knope,Minus the drinking problem.,1,5
Leslie Knope,I mean no disrespect.,1,5
Ron Swanson,The only reason anybody's going to this thing is because they're afraid of what Marlene'll do to them if they don't.,1,5
Ron Swanson,That woman is tough.,1,5
Ron Swanson,"In 1994, I gave her a nickname.",1,5
Ron Swanson,"It's unrepeatable, but it stuck.",1,5

Leslie Knope,How important are speeches?,1,5
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, ask the Gettysburg Address.",1,5
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it didn't answer your call?",1,5

Leslie Knope,It was a great learning experience because my mom casts a long shadow.,1,5
Leslie Knope,Read that part back to me.,1,5
Tom Haverford,"""I was learning disabled and my mom cast a very long shadow.""",1,5

Leslie Knope,"I need to mention the park and in a very subtle way, I need to let people know that I'm forging my own path and I have my own subcommittee.",1,5
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to sound braggy.,1,5
Leslie Knope,What do I do?,1,5
Tom Haverford,"It's about appearing humble, you know?",1,5
Tom Haverford,"Abraham Lincoln, when he started his speeches, he would come up and say, ""My name's Abraham Lincoln.""",1,5

Tom Haverford,"""I have no clue what I'm doing.""",1,5
Tom Haverford,"So, maybe you start off with something like that.",1,5

Leslie Knope,"""I am the Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing.""",1,5
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,1,5
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,1,5

Tom Haverford,How about this?,1,5
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope is definitely not a whore.""",1,5

Ann Perkins,Seriously?,1,5
Andy Dwyer,Yes.,1,5
Andy Dwyer,That is really hot.,1,5
Andy Dwyer,How come you don't dress up like that for me?,1,5
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I would feel a little silly putting on a nice dress to go to ""the couch.""",1,5
Ann Perkins,I haven't been out in so long.,1,5
Ann Perkins,Andy being in a cast has definitely put a crimp in our social life.,1,5
Ann Perkins,"I don't really know Leslie's mom, and I don't know what the Tellenson Award is, but at this moment in my life, it sounds like a magical evening.",1,5
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I'm out of milk.",1,5

Salvatore,"Now, what do you want me to do with this?",1,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, my mom is being honored tonight.",1,5

Leslie Knope,No!,1,5
Leslie Knope,Really?,1,5
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, she's totally blowing us off.",1,5
Leslie Knope,What?,1,5
Leslie Knope,That is not conduct worthy of the zoning board.,1,5
Marlene Griggs-Knope,She's a little weasel.,1,5
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Okay, I didn't want to have to use this, but her husband got a DUl in Illinois last week.",1,5
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And she's trying to keep it quiet.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, everyone has their problems.",1,5
Leslie Knope,"So, what should my next tactic be?",1,5
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"The DUl, Leslie.",1,5
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Let her know you know all about it, connect it to what you want, and then tell her if she doesn't help you, and soon, you're gonna tell everybody in town.",1,5
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could do that.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I want to win a Tellenson Award some day.",1,5
Leslie Knope,They don't give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.,1,5
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, they only give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.",1,5

Leslie Knope,Shoot!,1,5
Leslie Knope,"I have a tough assignment, and I need his help with it.",1,5
Ann Perkins,I could help.,1,5
Ann Perkins,Give me something to do.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan.",1,5
Leslie Knope,We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.,1,5
Leslie Knope,She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroom vroom vroom vroom and glug glug glug glug glug.,1,5
Ann Perkins,So you're gonna blackmail her?,1,5
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellenson style.",1,5
Ann Perkins,"That doesn't sound tough to me, that sounds slimy.",1,5
Ann Perkins,It sounds like your mom's telling you to be slimy.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you don't understand politics.",1,5
Leslie Knope,"Look, nursing is easy.",1,5
Ann Perkins,Really?,1,5
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them.",1,5
Leslie Knope,"But politics is different, you know?",1,5
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to bring the pain.,1,5
Leslie Knope,You can't let yourself get taken advantage of.,1,5
Ann Perkins,I think your mom's giving you bad advice.,1,5
Leslie Knope,I don't think so.,1,5
Ann Perkins,You just do everything your mom tells you to do?,1,5
Leslie Knope,You just do everything your boyfriend tells you to do?,1,5
Leslie Knope,Make any pancakes lately?,1,5
Ann Perkins,He has two broken legs.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and he's got three crutches.",1,5
Leslie Knope,And one of them is you!,1,5
Leslie Knope,And the other two are crutches.,1,5
Ann Perkins,"You know, I don't need to be here.",1,5
Frank Schnable,It's okay.,1,5
Frank Schnable,You're allowed to fight.,1,5
Frank Schnable,You two are just like everyone else.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, former Councilman Schnable.",1,5
Extra,"And now, a very special message from Mr. Anthony Tellenson himself, recorded earlier this year from his hospital bed, before he lost the power of speech.",1,5
Ann Perkins,"I'm leaving now, honey.",1,5
Ann Perkins,"Cool Ranch, got it.",1,5
Ann Perkins,Anything else?,1,5
Ann Perkins,Mmm I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get those tonight.,1,5
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I don't think I can find a store that's open that sells slippers.",1,5
Tom Haverford,I've been dying to go out with Mark.,1,5
Tom Haverford,Always thought we'd make a great team.,1,5
Tom Haverford,You know?,1,5
Tom Haverford,"He's handsome, I'm a cutie pie.",1,5
Tom Haverford,He's laid back.,1,5
Tom Haverford,"I'm more in your face, but in a fun way.",1,5
Tom Haverford,Ladies don't stand a chance.,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh What's with the hat?,1,5
Tom Haverford,It's called peacocking.,1,5
Tom Haverford,"Basically, I'm wearing something that kind of makes me stand out, like a peacock.",1,5
Tom Haverford,"So, the girls will be like, ""Hey, what's with that hat?"" I'm gonna go peacock it out.",1,5
Tom Haverford,I'll be back.,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,1,5
Extra,"Thank you, Tony, for those inspiring twitches and blinks.",1,5
Leslie Knope,I think we're gonna meet a little earlier than what you said.,1,5
Leslie Knope,How about Monday?,1,5
Janine Restrepo,Call my secretary and we'll set it up.,1,5
Leslie Knope,Not good enough.,1,5
Janine Restrepo,Not good enough?,1,5
Leslie Knope,Nope.,1,5
Leslie Knope,I know about things.,1,5
Janine Restrepo,"Well, my schedule is my schedule.",1,5
Janine Restrepo,"So, I'm just gonna get back to my dessert.",1,5
Leslie Knope,Drive much?,1,5
Janine Restrepo,Excuse me?,1,5
Leslie Knope,Your husband.,1,5
Leslie Knope,Does he drive much out of state? I know that your husband is a drunk driver.,1,5
Leslie Knope,My mom told me.,1,5
Janine Restrepo,What do you want?,1,5
Leslie Knope,Uh Just saying.,1,5
Janine Restrepo,Get out.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",1,5
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.,1,5
Janine Restrepo,Mmm-hmm.,1,5
Leslie Knope,I don't know what came over me.,1,5
Janine Restrepo,Leave.,1,5
Leslie Knope,I hope your husband gets help and that you have a long and happy marriage.,1,5
Tom Haverford,"Stacy, Becky tells me that you two are both real estate agents.",1,5
Tom Haverford,That must be fun.,1,5
Extra,Uh-huh.,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,"Any cool stories you got, huh?",1,5
Extra,Um What do you mean?,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,"Like, I don't know, anything weird or funny happen when you guys are showing people houses?",1,5
Extra,"Um One time, I forgot my keys to one of the houses.",1,5
Extra,"Whoa! Oh, my God, you do that, too?",1,5
Extra,Yeah.,1,5
Extra,I've done that.,1,5
Extra,That's the worst.,1,5
Extra,"Then you have to drive all the way back, and then you have to be like, ""I forgot my keys.""",1,5
Extra,"And then they're like, ""You did that twice.""",1,5
Tom Haverford,Look at these guys! The key-forgetting twins!,1,5
Tom Haverford,I'll be right back.,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,"Can I settle, please?",1,5
Tom Haverford,Dude.,1,5
Tom Haverford,What is your problem?,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,What?,1,5
Tom Haverford,"Becky and Stacy are both really into you, and you're blowing it with them.",1,5
Tom Haverford,And that's making them lose interest in me.,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,Becky and Stacy are boring.,1,5
Tom Haverford,"I need you back there, man.",1,5
Tom Haverford,"I've seen you hook up with more trashy chicks in the last year than I can count, all right?",1,5
Tom Haverford,"If there was a Tellenson Award for hooking up with trashy chicks all the time, you'd have several of those awards.",1,5
Tom Haverford,You're the king.,1,5
Tom Haverford,You're my hero.,1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, I'm gonna get out of here.",1,5
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'll see you Monday, okay?",1,5

Leslie Knope,"I tried, but I just couldn't do it.",1,5
Ann Perkins,Good.,1,5
Ann Perkins,That's a good thing.,1,5
Ann Perkins,It wasn't you.,1,5
Ann Perkins,"You know, there was definitely some truth about that thing you said about me and Andy.",1,5
Leslie Knope,No.,1,5
Leslie Knope,What?,1,5
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,1,5
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"Me, too.",1,5
Ann Perkins,Oh.,1,5
Andy Dwyer,Whoa! Hey! What the hell? Oh.,1,5
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie.",1,5
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were a dude.,1,5
Leslie Knope,The people who win awards aren't always the best people.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I think Ann and I are really good people, and someday others will see that and we'll get our due.",1,5
Leslie Knope,Would I like to win a Tellenson Award like my mom did? Sure.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"But my dad never won an award, and he was always happy.",1,5
Leslie Knope,"He lives in Florida, in a cemetery.",1,5
Leslie Knope,"The point is, my mom is alive and I love her.",1,5
Leslie Knope,She's one tough cookie.,1,5
Leslie Knope,"That's why everybody calls her ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee.""",1,5
Leslie Knope,Fondly.,1,5
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I'm married.",1,5
Tom Haverford,But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies.,1,5
Tom Haverford,The fact that I haven't even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to both of us.,1,5
Tom Haverford,You like the color orange? Carrots? You into those?,1,5

Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, you're not gonna go?",1,6
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on!,1,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you guys.",1,6

Nate,Finally.,1,6
Nate,Nice work.,1,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah.",1,6
Mark Brendanawicz,Yay.,1,6
Mark Brendanawicz,There used to be this huge speed bump in the center of town.,1,6
Mark Brendanawicz,It was insane.,1,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I got it lowered 2 inches.",1,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"Apparently, what I can achieve in government can literally be measured.",1,6
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Dr. Harris.",1,6
Ann Perkins,"Andy's playing a show tonight, and we'd love it if you came by.",1,6
Ann Perkins,I think there's gonna be a good turnout at Andy's show tonight.,1,6

Dr. Harris,"So, Andy's doing well?",1,6
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's a little shaky still, but that's to be expected.",1,6
Dr. Harris,"Well, not really.",1,6
Dr. Harris,"If he had his casts removed two weeks ago, the muscles wouldn't have atrophied so much.",1,6
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, two weeks ago?",1,6
Dr. Harris,That's when they were scheduled to come off.,1,6
Ann Perkins,But he told me that you told him he should wait.,1,6
Dr. Harris,No.,1,6
Dr. Harris,He rescheduled.,1,6
Dr. Harris,"Said it was personal, that he'd explain later, but then he never explained.",1,6

Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's up, people of Pawnee?",1,6
Andy Dwyer,All right!,1,6
Andy Dwyer,All right.,1,6
Andy Dwyer,"Uh In just a minute, Scarecrow Boat is gonna rock it out.",1,6
Andy Dwyer,Please be patient while we rock out the equipment setup.,1,6
Andy Dwyer,The band has had a few different names over the years.,1,6
Andy Dwyer,"We started, we were Teddy Bear Suicide, but then we changed it to Mouse Rat.",1,6
Andy Dwyer,Uh.,1,6
Andy Dwyer,"Then we were God Hates Figs, Department of Homeland Obscurity, Flames for Flames, Muscle Confusion, Nothing Rhymes with Orange, then Everything Rhymes with Orange, Punch Face Champions, Rad Wagon, Puppy Pendulum, Possum Pendulum, Penis Pendulum, Hand Rail Suicide, Angel Snack, Just the Tip, Three Skin Jet Black Pope, we went back to Mouse Rat, and now we are Scarecrow Boat.",1,6
Andy Dwyer,"God, when I hear myself say Scarecrow Boat out loud, I kind of hate it.",1,6
Leslie Knope,"Now, you know that we're gonna be building a park on a residential lot, so, of course we're gonna have to get the zoning codes approved and amended by our city council.",1,6
George Gernway,What kind of movies do you like?,1,6
Leslie Knope,Huh?,1,6

Leslie Knope,How difficult is rezoning in your town?,1,6
Leslie Knope,Could you go into detail a little bit about that?,1,6
George Gernway,Sure.,1,6
Leslie Knope,Great.,1,6
George Gernway,It's refreshing to be with someone who actually likes talking about government issues.,1,6
George Gernway,Most of the women I go out with find it boring.,1,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you have to have zoning codes, or else the whole thing could be chaos.",1,6
George Gernway,Your mother mentioned that you don't date much.,1,6
Leslie Knope,What?,1,6
Leslie Knope,I've been focusing on my career.,1,6
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?,1,6
George Gernway,I haven't been dating much either since my divorce.,1,6
George Gernway,It hasn't been easy.,1,6
George Gernway,"And I'm coping, but it was tough on the kids.",1,6
George Gernway,"Not my kids, 'cause they're grownup, but it was tough on their kids.",1,6
George Gernway,Shouldn't bring up my divorce on a first date.,1,6
George Gernway,But I feel I can tell you anything.,1,6
Leslie Knope,Uh,1,6
George Gernway,I think it's going quite well.,1,6
George Gernway,And she looks like a young Sandy Duncan.,1,6
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Mom.",1,6
Leslie Knope,He thinks we're on a date.,1,6
Leslie Knope,Did you tell him we were on a date?,1,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, if I told you it was a date, you never would've gone.",1,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You're not getting any younger.,1,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, neither is he.",1,6
Leslie Knope,And he's 62 years old.,1,6

Leslie Knope,I know that you are not gay.,2,1
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not.",2,1
Leslie Knope,But you're effeminate.,2,1
Tom Haverford,What?,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it.",2,1
Tom Haverford,"Yes, 'cause it was featured in Details magazine.",2,1
Tom Haverford,And it's awesome.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Effeminate.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, so the point is, do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?",2,1
Tom Haverford,Yes.,2,1
Tom Haverford,The statement was that you're very lonely and you need a pet.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Huh.,2,1
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?,2,1
Jerry Gergich,"They sent you Tshirts, too.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Oh!,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look, they sent us a Tshirt.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Hmmâ¦,2,1
Tom Haverford,Mine has a collar on it.,2,1
April Ludgate,There she is.,2,1
April Ludgate,Leslie!,2,1
April Ludgate,Hey!,2,1
Leslie Knope,Hey.,2,1
April Ludgate,"This is my boyfriend, Derek, and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben.",2,1
Ben,Hi.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Hey.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Oh!,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Wait, sorry, what's the situation?",2,1
April Ludgate,What do you mean?,2,1
Leslie Knope,How does this work?,2,1
April Ludgate,"Derek is gay, but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek.",2,1
April Ludgate,And I hate Ben.,2,1
Derek,It's not that complicated.,2,1
Ben,No.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Oh.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Sure.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it.",2,1
Leslie Knope,So what can I do for you guys?,2,1
April Ludgate,"They just really wanted to meet you, because you're kind of like their hero now.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, April, please, it was just penguins.",2,1
April Ludgate,No!,2,1
Leslie Knope,"I'm a public servant, and I'm not allowed to take a political stance.",2,1
Ben,"But you did, and it was awesome.",2,1
Derek,Yeah.,2,1
Derek,"None of the other politicians ever take a stand, and it means a lot to the whole gay community.",2,1
April Ludgate,"It does, and we're gonna have this party tomorrow night at The Bulge, and we had something to ask you.",2,1
April Ludgate,We really want you to be the guest of honor.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my.",2,1
Derek,It'd be amazing if you came.,2,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you have to come.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Who made this?,2,1
April Ludgate,We did.,2,1
Derek,"Yeah, we did.",2,1
Leslie Knope,How?,2,1
April Ludgate,Photoshop.,2,1
Leslie Knope,What?,2,1
Leslie Knope,Oh!,2,1
Ben,Computers.,2,1
Donna Meagle,"Hey, why are you all dolled up?",2,1
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I'm the guest of honor at this gay bar tonight.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I guess gay men are starting to like me.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I guess they think I'm fabulous or something.,2,1
Donna Meagle,"Well, you look good, girl.",2,1
Donna Meagle,You're gonna turn somebody tonight.,2,1
Leslie Knope,That was hands down the best interaction I've ever had with Donna.,2,1
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Marcia Langman from the Society For Family Stability Foundation.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello.",2,1
Leslie Knope,I love your top.,2,1
Marcia Langman,"Oh, thank you so much.",2,1
Marcia Langman,I was just hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday.,2,1
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have nothing to do with this, so.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?",2,1
Marcia Langman,"Well, you could resign, if you're up for it.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're serious?",2,1
Marcia Langman,"When you performed a marriage for gay penguins, using taxpayer money on government property, you were symbolically taking a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"That was not my intention, at all.",2,1
Marcia Langman,"Well, why else would you marry penguins?",2,1
Leslie Knope,Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.,2,1
Leslie Knope,And it was.,2,1
Marcia Langman,"Leslie, are you married?",2,1
Leslie Knope,No.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, Marcia.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Soon, probably.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"I have a plan, but, no, not now.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Not dating anyone yet.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Focusing on my career.,2,1
Marcia Langman,I thought so.,2,1
Marcia Langman,"So you couldn't possibly understand, but when gays marry, it ruins marriage for the rest of us.",2,1
Marcia Langman,"So, either you annul the wedding, or I'll publicly ask for your resignation.",2,1
Marcia Langman,You know what?,2,1
Marcia Langman,I'm so terrible with directions.,2,1
Marcia Langman,"If I'm headed to the parking lot, do I make a left out of here, or do I go right?",2,1
Leslie Knope,"It's a left, yeah.",2,1
Marcia Langman,Thank you.,2,1
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.,2,1
Marcia Langman,Annul the wedding!,2,1
Ann Perkins,Hey.,2,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi!,2,1
Ann Perkins,"I'm supposed to meet Leslie for lunch, but she actually works, so.",2,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Ouch!,2,1
Ann Perkins,Mark was brought to my hospital the night of the accident.,2,1
Ann Perkins,He was here for a week.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"I think when his head hit the ground, it must've knocked something loose, because he's actually a pretty nice guy now.",2,1
Ann Perkins,"And Andy, after we broke up, he told me he was going to Kansas to climb mountains.",2,1
Ann Perkins,"So, I don't really know where he is.",2,1
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, have you seen that documentary about food yet?",2,1
Ann Perkins,"No, I haven't.",2,1
Ann Perkins,But I heard it's really good.,2,1
Ann Perkins,I want to see it.,2,1
Mark Brendanawicz,We should go together.,2,1
Ann Perkins,What?,2,1
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, no.",2,1
Ann Perkins,I don't think so.,2,1
Ann Perkins,That would be like a date.,2,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,2,1
Mark Brendanawicz,Say no more.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Mmm.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I hate salad.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't want to ever keep secrets from you.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me, neither.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Look, let's invent our own secret language that only we understand.",2,1
Leslie Knope,And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.,2,1
Ann Perkins,Okay.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"But in the meantime, I'm just gonna tell you in English.",2,1
Ann Perkins,Mark kind of asked me out.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"He weirdly asked me to go see a movie with him, and I said no, of course, but I just I just wanted to let you know.",2,1
Leslie Knope,I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.,2,1
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"No, of course you are.",2,1
Ann Perkins,And your friendship is the most important thing to me.,2,1
Ann Perkins,And he's off-limits.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language.",2,1
Ann Perkins,I know.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I can't believe this is a gay bar.,2,1
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, especially with that heterosexual cowboy greeting us on the way in.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Where should I drink now?,2,1
Tom Haverford,There's a bar on Eighth Street called Pitchers and Catchers.,2,1
Tom Haverford,You can go there.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Hey!,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Here's the plan.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Our position is, we have no position.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say, ""Thank you for the party, but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me.""",2,1
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I can't believe you came.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April.",2,1
April Ludgate,Derek!,2,1
April Ludgate,It's Leslie Knope.,2,1
Derek,"Leslie Knope, you're my hero!",2,1
Leslie Knope,Oh!,2,1
Leslie Knope,That's nice.,2,1
Ben,"Leslie, you are looking hot.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Really?,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben.",2,1
Leslie Knope,I'm really enjoying this hug.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"That's so nice, but I need to tell you something.",2,1
Bartender,This one is on us.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it's freeâ¦",2,1
Derek,Leslie Knope!,2,1
April Ludgate,"She's Leslie Knope, and she wants to recruit you!",2,1
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Gentlemen.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would just like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party, especially on a night when the Colts are playing.",2,1
Extra,"We love you, Leslie!",2,1

Ann Perkins,I'm really sober!,2,1
Leslie Knope,Okay!,2,1
Leslie Knope,Get a drink!,2,1

Leslie Knope,"And they know how to have fun, and the dancing!",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Just, it's... Everyone is just who they are.",2,1
Leslie Knope,And who they are is just stone cold gay.,2,1

Leslie Knope,"I had three drinks named after me, so that's pretty fun.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Plus, Ben and Derek are taking me shopping on Saturday.",2,1
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna find out my actual bra size.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I guess I'm kind of like queen of the gays.,2,1
Ron Swanson,Bully for you.,2,1
Ron Swanson,I just got a phone call.,2,1
Ron Swanson,They want you to go on Pawnee Today.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Wow.,2,1
Leslie Knope,That's huge.,2,1
Leslie Knope,What's the topic?,2,1
Ron Swanson,You.,2,1
Ron Swanson,That Marcia Langman from the family thing is calling for your resignation.,2,1
Leslie Knope,No!,2,1
Ron Swanson,You gotta go on and defend yourself.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Why?,2,1
Leslie Knope,I haven't even officially taken a stand on gay marriage.,2,1
Ron Swanson,That's funny.,2,1
Ron Swanson,Somebody just told me you were queen of the gays.,2,1
Leslie Knope,That was me.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo.",2,1
Leslie Knope,It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.,2,1
Tom Haverford,"It's the big time, Leslie.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know.",2,1
Leslie Knope,It is.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I just wish I were here under different circumstances.,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,Guess who?,2,1
Tom Haverford,Uh Megan Fox?,2,1
Tom Haverford,One of the Desperate Housewives?,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"No, Joan Callamezzo.",2,1
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Joanie!",2,1
Tom Haverford,"What's up, gorgeous?",2,1
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Tom comes on the show all the time.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Joan loves him.,2,1
Tom Haverford,You have the softest skin of any woman in Pawnee.,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,Thank you.,2,1
Tom Haverford,"I wish you could reach, from your TV screen, and just touch Joan's skin for a second.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,That's sweet.,2,1
Tom Haverford,You'd have a treat.,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,You're pretty soft yourself.,2,1
Tom Haverford,How are your kids doing?,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,They're pretty good.,2,1
Tom Haverford,Is it tough for them to have a mother that is so beautiful?,2,1
Tom Haverford,What's it like being the most attractive woman in Pawnee?,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"You keep up those funnies, I'm gonna have to invite you over for supper.",2,1
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'll have to come over for supper.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,Oh! You must.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,Ann Perkins.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,How you doing?,2,1
Ann Perkins,I'm good.,2,1
Ann Perkins,How was mountain climbing?,2,1
Andy Dwyer,What? Can I come in? I just want to talk to you for a second.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"We have a controversial topic today, the gay penguin marriage at the Pawnee Zoo.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"So, Marcia, what is all the fuss about?",2,1
Marcia Langman,"The fuss is that Miss Knope claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause, and then that very night, she was the guest of honor at a pro-gay marriage rally at a bar called The Bulge.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"Miss Knope, how do you respond?",2,1
Leslie Knope,I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line.,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right?",2,1
Marcia Langman,"Joan, we don't want to be unreasonable.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,Of course not.,2,1
Marcia Langman,"We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Oh! Is that it?,2,1
Marcia Langman,That would do it.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Anything else? You want me to jump off a building? Perform hara-kiri?,2,1
Marcia Langman,"Move to a different town? No, I kid.",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,Full of ideas here today.,2,1
Leslie Knope,This is the reason why people don't go into politics.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out?",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"Wow, look at that! Wow, we're lighting up here.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Great.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Let's go for it.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Bring it on.,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,I've never seen that on our show before.,2,1
Leslie Knope,How does this work?,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, there Push that, and--",2,1
Leslie Knope,Great.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're on the air!,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,You're on the air!,2,1
Joan Callamezzo,Good!,2,1
Caller,"Yeah, I think that lady should resign.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Next caller.,2,1
Caller,You should resign and repay your salary.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, two for resign.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Next caller.,2,1
Caller,"I just want to say that I love the zoo, and the zoo is really fun.",2,1
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,2,1
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.,2,1
Caller,And I think you should resign.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,You look great.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.,2,1
Ann Perkins,Thanks.,2,1
Ann Perkins,You look fancy.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, the monkey suit.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,"Cost 3,000 bucks, but totally worth it.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,"I sold out! I got a boring office job in town, so I gotta dress up, you know, the grind.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,"But I'm really happy, and I really feel like I've matured a lot.",2,1
Ann Perkins,Good! That's... I'm happy for you.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,"So listen, I was sitting in the cubicle the other day, just doing some thinking, and some growing",2,1
Ann Perkins,And some maturing.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,Yes! Maturing.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,"And darn it if I don't just miss you, and",2,1
Ann Perkins,Andy.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,"Well, A-Cakes, just let me I love you, and I'm just really sorry for the way that I treated you.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,"I was the worst boyfriend ever, I know that, and I really think it would behoove us to give it another shot.",2,1
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, look.",2,1
Ann Perkins,"I'm really happy for you about your job and that you've learned some new words, but I'm sure about my decision.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,Okay.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,Say no more.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, hit me up on my cell phone.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,I'll be around.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,"And if you wanna talk, or grab coffee or something like that.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,Okay?,2,1
Ann Perkins,Okay.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,Oh.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,Gotta get back to the office.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,Have a good one.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,Good seeing you.,2,1
Ann Perkins,Bye.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,And the hardest part about living in this pit is probably keeping my suit pressed.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,And the rats.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,It's like a freaking rat parade every night.,2,1
Andy Dwyer,"I just want to be close to her house, because I need to protect her.",2,1
Andy Dwyer,'Cause there are some weird people that live around here.,2,1
Caller,"Yeah, if you let penguins get married, where does it end? I mean, would you let me marry my guinea pig?",2,1
Caller,Because I really do want to marry my guinea pig.,2,1
Caller,I'll take my answer off the air.,2,1
Marcia Langman,I think that's a valuable point.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way.",2,1
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"That penguin wedding was cute, damn it.",2,1
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna annul it.,2,1
Marcia Langman,I'd ask you to reconsider.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia.",2,1
Marcia Langman,Is that right?,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs! But I apologize.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute!",2,1
Joan Callamezzo,Where are you from originally?,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no! What did I do?",2,1
Marcia Langman,"So, you will not be annulling the marriage?",2,1
Leslie Knope,No.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I will not be annulling.,2,1
Leslie Knope,No.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Look at them.,2,1
Leslie Knope,They're just in their own little penguin love bubble.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever.,2,1
Ann Perkins,Hi!,2,1
Leslie Knope,Hi!,2,1
Leslie Knope,You know what I realized?,2,1
Ann Perkins,What?,2,1
Leslie Knope,We're just animals.,2,1
Leslie Knope,We don't know anything about love.,2,1
Ann Perkins,Okay.,2,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,1
Leslie Knope,I think you should go on that date with Mark.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Leslie--",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Really, seriously.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours.",2,1
Ann Perkins,"Look, I told you I'm not going on a date with him.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it.",2,1
Leslie Knope,All that's important to me is that we're still friends.,2,1
Ann Perkins,"Me, too!",2,1
Leslie Knope,Good! Great.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun.",2,1
Ann Perkins,Huh?,2,1
Leslie Knope,"So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa.",2,1
Leslie Knope,"Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy.",2,1
Leslie Knope,At least they'll be together.,2,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look! Six Flags! I should take them on a water slide.",2,1
Leslie Knope,They might die.,2,1
Leslie Knope,But it would be so cute!,2,1

Leslie Knope,You make such good coffee.,2,2
Ann Perkins,"Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually.",2,2
Ann Perkins,It was kind of weird.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex.",2,2
Leslie Knope,"You know, we slept together six years ago.",2,2
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm over it.",2,2
Leslie Knope,Or am I?,2,2
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.,2,2
Leslie Knope,This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"A community garden, right in the middle of the pit.",2,2
Leslie Knope,We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.,2,2
Leslie Knope,And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.,2,2
Tom Haverford,It's so hot.,2,2
Tom Haverford,I had to get some more iced tea.,2,2
Leslie Knope,People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.,2,2
Leslie Knope,And Tom is our master horticulturist.,2,2
Leslie Knope,He knows all the scientific names for everything.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?",2,2
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,2,2
Leslie Knope,Like this.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"What's this, Tom?",2,2
Tom Haverford,"Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems.",2,2
Tom Haverford,"Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers.",2,2
Leslie Knope,And those over there?,2,2
Tom Haverford,Those are some Diddys.,2,2
Tom Haverford,Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.,2,2
Leslie Knope,Growing beautifully.,2,2
Tom Haverford,Those Ludacrises are coming in great.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"Look, someone planted something new.",2,2
Leslie Knope,What's this?,2,2
Leslie Knope,"What do you think, carrots?",2,2
Leslie Knope,"If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.",2,2
Leslie Knope,Maybe some kind of spice?,2,2
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,2,2
Tom Haverford,"You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it.",2,2
Leslie Knope,"Ron, did you get my texts?",2,2
Ron Swanson,No.,2,2
Leslie Knope,Did you get my emails?,2,2

Leslie Knope,That'll leak to the press.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.",2,2
Ron Swanson,You don't have funding.,2,2
Leslie Knope,And we never will if this gets out.,2,2

Leslie Knope,We need to find out who we're dealing with.,2,2
Leslie Knope,Who is this person?,2,2

Leslie Knope,"It was kind of indescribable, actually.",2,2
Leslie Knope,I felt like I was floating.,2,2
Leslie Knope,Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.,2,2
Leslie Knope,It was just an insanely good brownie.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.",2,2
Leslie Knope,"Cause we flip the headline, and it's not ""Community Garden Infested With Pot.""",2,2
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone.""",2,2
Leslie Knope,We got to catch this guy.,2,2

Dave Sanderson,What?,2,2

Dave Sanderson,"We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy.",2,2
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look.",2,2
Leslie Knope,Tom and I were in that van together.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it.",2,2

Leslie Knope,My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.,2,2

Leslie Knope,And we'll talk about the coat.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,I can't give it to you.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,Do you understand?,2,2

Dave Sanderson,"So, where's that marijuana at?",2,2
Leslie Knope,It's down in the garden.,2,2
Tom Haverford,"Good meeting you, man! We should grab a drink or something sometime.",2,2
Leslie Knope,I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.,2,2
Leslie Knope,"That's all that matters, you know? That Ann is home and she's okay.",2,2
Leslie Knope,And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.,2,2
Leslie Knope,Just important that they're both in their homes--,2,2
Tom Haverford,Leslie.,2,2
Tom Haverford,Mark's an idiot.,2,2
Tom Haverford,You can do a lot better than him.,2,2
Tom Haverford,Forget about him.,2,2

Tom Haverford,I didn't mean me.,2,2
Tom Haverford,"Keep it in your pants, Knope.",2,2
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, it actually-- It was there",2,2
Dave Sanderson,These are carrots.,2,2
Leslie Knope,Duh! You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?,2,2
Dave Sanderson,"Is that the house there, where your best friend lives? Where she saw the van from?",2,2
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,Okay.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,I get it.,2,2

Dave Sanderson,"Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date.",2,2
Leslie Knope,"No, I did not.",2,2
Leslie Knope,There actually was weed here,2,2
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,I think it's kind of cute.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,I like Miss Knope.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,I liked her.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,"I got to say, I--",2,2
Dave Sanderson,"When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.",2,2
Dave Sanderson,Miss Knope was attractive to me.,2,2
Dave Sanderson,"As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor.",2,2
Dave Sanderson,I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.,2,2

Leslie Knope,"Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously.",2,3
Tom Haverford,But I want to be a judge.,2,3

Leslie Knope,That's wonderful.,2,3
Leslie Knope,"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge.",2,3
Leslie Knope,"So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy.",2,3
April Ludgate,Beauty pageants are idiotic.,2,3
April Ludgate,But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets 600 dollars.,2,3

Trish Ianetta,But the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me.,2,3

Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, it's just It's raining outside, and he's living in a pit, you know?",2,3

April Ludgate,"Oh, my God.",2,3
April Ludgate,I quit.,2,3
April Ludgate,I quit.,2,3
Announcer,"Okay, I guess she really is quitting.",2,3
April Ludgate,"No, I didn't win.",2,3

Leslie Knope,"Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it.",2,3
Leslie Knope,Okay?,2,3
Leslie Knope,Consider yourselves sequestered.,2,3
Leslie Knope,"I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial.",2,3
Leslie Knope,But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.,2,3
Jessica Wicks,"Look, I am the only one here who has entered and won this contest in the past.",2,3
Jessica Wicks,And I think Trish is a no-brainer.,2,3

Andy Dwyer,I don't I don't want any.,2,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so, it's still 3- 2 for Trish.",2,3
Leslie Knope,"Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, ""Who is the most impressive woman here tonight?""",2,3
Announcer,It's the hot one.,2,3
Announcer,Trish lanetta!,2,3
Mark Brendanawicz,These are amazing.,2,3

Andy Dwyer,And now it's me.,2,3
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone.",2,3
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just take a moment to give a round of applause to all the contestants this evening?,2,3

Leslie Knope,"This isn't the first time that Susans have lost to Trishes, and it won't be the last.",2,3
Leslie Knope,"Susan and I will continue on until the women of Pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies, but by the contents of their brains.",2,3
Leslie Knope,"And, Trish, I may not have voted for you, but now is the time for us to come together.",2,3
Leslie Knope,"I hope you honor this crown with dignity, and a devotion to all--",2,3
Trish Ianetta,"One, two, three!",2,3

Dave Sanderson,We left it kind of open-ended.,2,3
Leslie Knope,We did.,2,3
Dave Sanderson,And that's made me uncomfortable.,2,3
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,3
Dave Sanderson,"So I thought I'd come in and ask you, and just get some clearance on this.",2,3

Councilman Dexhart,"And to my wife, I apologize.",2,4
Councilman Dexhart,"All I can say is I wasn't just having sex, I was making love to a beautiful woman and her boyfriend, and a third person, whose name I never learned.",2,4
Councilman Dexhart,"Furthermore, it was wrong of me to say I was building houses for the underprivileged, when I was actually having four way sex in a cave in Brazil.",2,4
Tom Haverford,I bet cave sex is insane.,2,4
Leslie Knope,Why?,2,4
Tom Haverford,Because of the echoes and the humidity.,2,4
Donna Meagle,Mmmhmm.,2,4
Councilman Dexhart,"In my defense, it was my birthday and I really wanted to do it.",2,4
Leslie Knope,I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.,2,4
Leslie Knope,"Personally, all I care about is Councilman Dexhart's policies.",2,4
Leslie Knope,Not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex.,2,4
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, I heard he was.",2,4
Perd Hapley,One more shocking revelation in a story that just won't stop unfolding.,2,4

Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, you're married, and you hit on women constantly.",2,4
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but I've never sealed the deal.",2,4
Tom Haverford,Just window shopping.,2,4
Tom Haverford,"You can fly to Brazil, just don't enter the cave.",2,4
Tom Haverford,Am I right?,2,4
Tom Haverford,Up top!,2,4
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sure that you think that you're clean, but I bet that we could find something on you.",2,4
Tom Haverford,"I changed my name, which is legal, and once in high school, a girl beat me in a wrestling match.",2,4
Tom Haverford,That's it.,2,4
Tom Haverford,I bet anything I could find worse stuff on all you guys.,2,4
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you suggesting a game?,2,4
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm in.,2,4

Jerry Gergich,What?,2,4
Dave Sanderson,"Well, he's got a couple of 359s on him.",2,4
Dave Sanderson,Public urination.,2,4
Jerry Gergich,I don't like this game.,2,4
Jerry Gergich,I just don't like it.,2,4

Leslie Knope,You know what I'm gonna do?,2,4
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say that I was married.,2,4
Leslie Knope,"The real question is, should I say that I have kids?",2,4

Ann Perkins,Whoa!,2,4
Leslie Knope,What if I get drunk and I talk about Darfur too much?,2,4

Leslie Knope,What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?,2,4
Leslie Knope,"What if instead of Tic Tacs, I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?",2,4
Ann Perkins,Those are all insane hypotheticals.,2,4

Leslie Knope,I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.,2,4
Leslie Knope,"We went out a couple times after that, but then he got weird.",2,4
Leslie Knope,"I know it sounds crazy, I'm a grown woman, but I am just not good on first dates.",2,4
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay.",2,4
Ann Perkins,Okay.,2,4
Ann Perkins,"You have a problem, and this is how we're gonna fix it.",2,4
Leslie Knope,I know what you're thinking.,2,4
Leslie Knope,"I wear an earpiece, you sit at a table nearby, you speak into a mic, you tell me what to say on the date.",2,4
Leslie Knope,"But let me tell you something, Ann, it never works.",2,4
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no.",2,4
Ann Perkins,We are gonna go to a restaurant and have a practice date.,2,4

Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna need your suggestions about my wardrobe ASAP.",2,5
Tom Haverford,"I told you, gold sequin sweatpants.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Also, remember, everyone, Venezuela is a poor country.",2,5
Leslie Knope,These men are not used to the wealth and flash that we have here in central Indiana.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am a little nervous.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has kind of a tricky history with welcoming foreign visitors.,2,5
Leslie Knope,But things have changed.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Our guests are gonna stay in a motel, for sure.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!",2,5

Leslie Knope,How do you fit all of Pawnee in a 48 hour visit?,2,5
Leslie Knope,I had to drop the Rock and Roll bowling alley from our itinerary.,2,5
Leslie Knope,That was one of the most difficult phone calls I've ever had to make.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Hello, most excellent representatives of the great Parks Department of Boraqua, Venezuela.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"I am Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and Chairwoman of the Departmental Ad Hoc Subcommittee for Pit Beautification, Leslie Knope.",2,5

Raul,"And Elvis Correja, Administrator of Hedges.",2,5
Leslie Knope,And he is?,2,5
Raul,Pay no attention to him.,2,5
Raul,"He is our intern, Johnny.",2,5
Raul,He is worthless.,2,5
Raul,We are quite tired from our trip.,2,5
Raul,"Could you have your servant collect our bags, please?",2,5

Raul,I like to party.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, my job is to see to your every need.",2,5
Antonio,Do we just select the woman we desire?,2,5
Antonio,I will take the large black one.,2,5
Tom Haverford,Interesting choice.,2,5
Leslie Knope,What?,2,5
Raul,Do you have some kind of book with photos of the women available to us?,2,5
Raul,"If not, I will also take the sexy black one.",2,5
Donna Meagle,I am not surprised at all.,2,5
Donna Meagle,I've been to South America.,2,5
Donna Meagle,I did very well there.,2,5
Leslie Knope,I think there might've been a translation problem.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"When I said party, I meant one that did not include sex for pay.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"But one that had food and drink and dancing, that sort of thing.",2,5
Raul,"So, no women?",2,5
Leslie Knope,No.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Off to kind of a weird start.,2,5
Leslie Knope,We have so much to learn from each other.,2,5

Jerry Gergich,Okay.,2,5
Raul,This is a gold plated replica of the gun Hugo Chavez used in the 1992 Socialist revolution.,2,5
Raul,It is a gift.,2,5
Leslie Knope,This gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace between our two nations.,2,5
Leslie Knope,A key aspect to diplomacy is gift giving.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"The gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest, but not so nice that it shames him.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it needs to represent the local culture.",2,5
Leslie Knope,And I found the perfect thing.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"A bottle of high fructose corn syrup, made right here in Pawnee's own Sweetums factory.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Sweetums!,2,5
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, Sweetums!",2,5
Leslie Knope,Since 1891.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"And eight and a half dozen rubber baby bottle nipples, also made here in Pawnee.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Kernston's Rubber Nipples, tastes like the real thing.",2,5
Raul,Yes.,2,5
Raul,And we too are pleased to be here in your dirty alleyway.,2,5
Raul,"We thank you for the container of sap, and the bag of garbage.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"His English isn't perfect, so I don't think he realizes how insulting he's being.",2,5
Raul,"We're also sister cities with Kaesong, North Korea.",2,5
Raul,Their town is far nicer.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"That's fine, it's my job.",2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm a diplomat.,2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm not supposed to take it personally.,2,5
Raul,"We haven't been here for a very long time, but what we have seen is, really, from the bottom of our hearts, truly depressing.",2,5
Raul,"Really, really sad stuff.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"I mean, that's why people respect Hillary Clinton so much.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"'Cause, nobody takes a punch like her.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world.",2,5
Raul,"It's funny because Antonio said to me, ""Can we turn this car around and say we're sick or something, or that we lost our way?""",2,5
Raul,"Of course, that would be rude to you.",2,5
Elvis,What is your profession?,2,5
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm a city planner.,2,5
Elvis,This city was planned?,2,5
Elvis,"On the drive in, I saw a tattoo parlor, next to a school next to a Taco Bell.",2,5
Elvis,It looks like it was designed by a very stupid rodent.,2,5
Ann Perkins,He's actually a pretty smart rodent.,2,5
Mark Brendanawicz,Uhoh!,2,5
Elvis,Ah!,2,5
Elvis,You have a quick wit.,2,5
Elvis,You know what?,2,5
Elvis,"I've changed my mind, I will have you for the evening.",2,5
Ann Perkins,Oh!,2,5
Ann Perkins,Boy.,2,5
Mark Brendanawicz,She'll get back to you on that.,2,5
Ron Swanson,"Politically, no, I don't support Chavez.",2,5

Tom Haverford,"The banana you wanted, senor.",2,5
Raul,Ah!,2,5
Raul,Finally.,2,5
Raul,You peel.,2,5
Tom Haverford,What?,2,5
Raul,"With your hands, you peel the banana.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Okay!,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Let's get started, shall we?",2,5
Leslie Knope,I have a full day of activities planned.,2,5
Elvis,I would like to see where the children are fed the sweeteners.,2,5
Leslie Knope,A restaurant?,2,5
Raul,American children are fattened more efficiently than any other children in the world.,2,5
Raul,"I mean, they're like little basketballs.",2,5
Raul,"I mean, they're huge, little porkers.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,5
Leslie Knope,This is our thermometer!,2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"But I need 35,000 dollars, and the city doesn't have enough money in its budget.",2,5
Raul,I do not understand.,2,5
Leslie Knope,You've never had a budget shortage?,2,5
Elvis,No.,2,5
Raul,Venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves.,2,5
Raul,"Massive, I mean, tremendous, like, you would not believe.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Hmm.,2,5
Raul,"The state sells the oil, and keeps all the money, and we build whatever we want.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Wow, well.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Now, I do not understand.",2,5
Raul,I feel my English was very clear.,2,5
Raul,Shall I repeat?,2,5
Raul,"Venezuela, Venezuela, my country, has a lot of oil.",2,5
Raul,Oil is food for cars.,2,5
Leslie Knope,The Venezuelans are a very confident people.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, I know these guys didn't turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be.",2,5
Tom Haverford,You said they might not know what toilet paper is.,2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm calling an audible.,2,5
Leslie Knope,We can't be humble anymore.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"What we're gonna do is, we're gonna take them to our best park and we're gonna blow their socks off.",2,5
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I don't think that's gonna blow their socks off.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Fine, we'll go further.",2,5
Leslie Knope,We'll take them to Chicago and pretend it's part of Pawnee.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Or New York.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Or London!,2,5
Leslie Knope,"No, wait, the money's different there.",2,5
Leslie Knope,They'll figure it out.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Okay, never mind.",2,5
Leslie Knope,We'll go to the park.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Everybody doing okay back there?,2,5
Leslie Knope,Comfortable?,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, the motel we're putting you up in is really nice.",2,5

Leslie Knope,Wow.,2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm coming over to your house then.,2,5
Raul,"I see what you're getting at, but no, thank you.",2,5
Raul,I am still primarily interested in the large black woman.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Here we are!,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Take it in, boys.",2,5
Raul,This is an embarrassment to America.,2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?,2,5
Raul,You are right to want to correct this.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Correct what?,2,5
Raul,"This is the giant pit of dirt you were telling us about, is it not?",2,5
Raul,The one you want to turn into a park?,2,5
Leslie Knope,"No, no.",2,5
Leslie Knope,This is already a park.,2,5
Leslie Knope,And it's one of our best loved parks.,2,5
Elvis,Why are the trees so small?,2,5
Leslie Knope,They're not that small.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Besides, size doesn't matter.",2,5
Raul,"Yes, it does.",2,5
Raul,Our trees are huge.,2,5
Raul,We build tunnels through them.,2,5
Raul,The parks in Boraqua are far superior.,2,5
Raul,"The park in my hometown, El parque del Este, we have a monorail, and we have an aquarium, and we have the Jaripa Amphitheater.",2,5
Raul,It's huge.,2,5
Elvis,Lady Gaga played there last week.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Great.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't have Lady Gaga.",2,5
Leslie Knope,And I don't think she's going to come here unless her career takes a very bad turn.,2,5
Leslie Knope,But we have something more beautiful than Lady Gaga.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Democracy.,2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna show you an example of that.,2,5

Tom Haverford,Gracias.,2,5
Tom Haverford,I find it incredibly demeaning.,2,5
Tom Haverford,But guess what?,2,5
Tom Haverford,Cash money.,2,5
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna make it rain. I'm just gonna pick that up real quick.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready?",2,5
Leslie Knope,We're about to start.,2,5
Raul,This is where you have your meetings?,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, the location rotates.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Where do you hold your meetings?,2,5
Raul,"Well, now that you ask, we usually rotate as well between different fortresses and citadels, and palaces.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Hmm.,2,5
Leslie Knope,We don't need palaces.,2,5
Leslie Knope,The ideas are what shine in our meetings.,2,5
Mel,What are you?,2,5
Mel,Some kind of moron?,2,5
Mel,Why don't you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms?,2,5
Mel,They're so much more sanitary than paper towels!,2,5
Mel,Anyone knows that!,2,5
Gretel,My dog went to one of your parks and ate another dog's feces.,2,5
Gretel,And I'm going to sue you for that.,2,5
Lawrence,How do you like it?,2,5
Leslie Knope,No!,2,5
Lawrence,How do you like that?,2,5
Lawrence,Now imagine you're holding coffee.,2,5
Raul,This is outrageous.,2,5
Raul,Where are the armed men who come in to take the protesters away?,2,5
Raul,Where are they?,2,5
Raul,This kind of behavior is never tolerated in Boraqua.,2,5
Raul,"You shout like that, they put you in jail.",2,5
Raul,Right away.,2,5
Raul,"No trial, no nothing.",2,5
Raul,Journalists?,2,5

Raul,"You undercook fish, believe it or not, jail.",2,5
Raul,"You overcook chicken, also jail.",2,5
Raul,"Undercook, overcook.",2,5
Raul,You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up?,2,5
Raul,"Believe it or not, jail, right away.",2,5
Raul,"We have the best patients in the world, because of jail.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was tough going, but it was lively.",2,5
Leslie Knope,What did you think of the open forum?,2,5
Elvis,This meeting of ugly people yelling?,2,5
Elvis,It is like torture.,2,5
Leslie Knope,That's one perspective.,2,5
Raul,"In Boraqua, the government moves like a hot knife through butter.",2,5
Raul,"Not as this here, listening to people yelling, these fat faces turning all red?",2,5
Raul,Are you kidding me?,2,5
Raul,We're like kings!,2,5
Raul,We walk down the street and they treat us like rock stars.,2,5
Raul,We answer to nobody.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"In a true Democracy, we believe that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable.",2,5
Lawrence,Hey!,2,5
Lawrence,These pretzels suck!,2,5
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,2,5
Leslie Knope,See?,2,5
Raul,No wonder nothing ever gets done in this country.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Really?,2,5
Leslie Knope,Nothing gets done?,2,5
Leslie Knope,Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Or American Idol.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Or the moon!,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there.",2,5
Raul,"Look, this is not personal.",2,5
Raul,We just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting.,2,5
Leslie Knope,I think you're rude.,2,5
Leslie Knope,And I think you've been rude since you came here.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!",2,5
Raul,Hey!,2,5
Raul,Do not disrespect Chavez.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Stupid Chavez.,2,5
Raul,I just told you not to disrespect him.,2,5

Leslie Knope,They started it.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Look, those guys were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Now, I may have lost my cool, but they deserved it.",2,5
Ron Swanson,Okay.,2,5
Ron Swanson,I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.,2,5
Leslie Knope,No!,2,5

Leslie Knope,"It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys.",2,5
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna return the money.,2,5
Tom Haverford,Are you crazy? You could buy a low-end Lexus with that money.,2,5
Ann Perkins,"Or, you could build a park with that money.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the pros and cons.,2,5
Ann Perkins,"Pro, we could fill in the pit and build a park.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money.",2,5
Tom Haverford,"Pro, 35,000 dollars worth of dirty money.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Con, not quite sure why that's a pro.",2,5
Mark Brendanawicz,"Pro, we can fill in the pit.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Con, Ann already said that.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Pro and con never works!,2,5
Tom Haverford,"Pro, yes it does.",2,5
Leslie Knope,Fine.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Fine.,2,5
Leslie Knope,We'll keep the money.,2,5

Leslie Knope,"Meeting adjourned, Jerry!",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, I still feel kind of weird about this money.",2,5
Ron Swanson,Okay.,2,5
Ron Swanson,"Look, I know they've given you a hard time.",2,5

Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is a check for 35,000 dollars and it is to build a park.",2,5
Raul,How generous!,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's really generous.",2,5
Raul,"Now say ""Viva Venezuela!""",2,5
Leslie Knope,Viva Venezuela!,2,5
Raul,Viva Chavez!,2,5
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Venezuela!",2,5
Raul,"""Viva Chavez!"" Say it!",2,5
Leslie Knope,"Aw, come on.",2,5
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to ""viva"" that guy.",2,5
Raul,"We just gave you 35,000 dollars.",2,5
Raul,"That's worth one ""viva.""",2,5
Leslie Knope,Viva Chavez.,2,5
Raul,Yes! Viva Chavez!,2,5
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,5
Leslie Knope,What is he saying?,2,5

Leslie Knope,Committee?,2,5
April Ludgate,Yeah.,2,5
April Ludgate,They're a Committee to Humiliate and Shame America.,2,5
Raul,It will be a good video.,2,5
Leslie Knope,The Committee to Humiliate and Shame America?,2,5
Raul,Yes.,2,5
Raul,It is Hugo Chavez's passion project.,2,5
Raul,And we just had an idea.,2,5
Raul,"Why don't you call the park after Chavez? You know, you call it Hugo Chavez Park.",2,5
Raul,"And you can have a nice, big fountain of his head, so that when the water is coming out he is spitting at you all the time.",2,5
Raul,You should write this down.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Viva America! Viva Pawnee! Viva Mayor Walter Gunderson!,2,5
Raul,You have offended us.,2,5
Raul,You have offended the government of Boraqua.,2,5
Raul,You are no longer our sister.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"No, America is not perfect.",2,5
Leslie Knope,But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you got to get tough.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome.",2,5
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Unless that's what the people want.,2,5
Leslie Knope,"And that, sir, is democracy.",2,5
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, come see this!",2,5
Tom Haverford,Check out this video April sent me.,2,5
April Ludgate,"Hey, guys.",2,5
April Ludgate,I'm at Johnny's place in Venezuela.,2,5
April Ludgate,"It's okay, I guess.",2,5
April Ludgate,He has like five million rooms.,2,5
April Ludgate,And this is only his guesthouse.,2,5
Leslie Knope,Holy cow!,2,5
April Ludgate,There's a lot of guys with guns here.,2,5
April Ludgate,"It's better than my mom's house, I guess.",2,5
April Ludgate,"So, tell Leslie I don't know when I'm gonna be back.",2,5
April Ludgate,"Oh, and Donna's here.",2,5
Donna Meagle,"Hey, guys! Hola!",2,5

Leslie Knope,And this is clean.,2,6
Leslie Knope,How do we speed up the process?,2,6
Leslie Knope,How do we kaboom it?,2,6

Leslie Knope,I never realized how frustrating it is to be in the government.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"In my next life, I'm going into private industry.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Maybe strip mining.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody take out their thinking caps and rip them up.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Then take out your doing caps, 'cause we're gonna do something today.",2,6
Tom Haverford,I have a couple of doing caps in my wallet.,2,6
Tom Haverford,That's what I call condoms.,2,6

Leslie Knope,"Focus, please.",2,6

Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys.",2,6
Leslie Knope,These suggestions aren't gonna suggest themselves.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Jerry.",2,6
Leslie Knope,This idea better be good.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Ann?,2,6
Ann Perkins,I support you.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Good.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,You could petition to expedite the Architecture Review Board process.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Mark, buddy, you're not listening to me.",2,6
Leslie Knope,I want to kaboom it.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Okay?,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,Can I talk to you outside really quick?,2,6

Leslie Knope,Yes.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,And you'll do whatever it takes?,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I am so sick of moving like a slug.",2,6
Leslie Knope,I want to move like a cheetah.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Or a slug driving a remote controlled car.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Something more plausible than that, but fast.",2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,Would you break the rules?,2,6
Leslie Knope,I won't murder.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,That's good to know.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,But it's actually very simple.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you wanna fill in the pit, just go fill it in.",2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like that.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wow.",2,6

Leslie Knope,Is it Ron?,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no.",2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,It's nobody.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's nobody, it's you.",2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to be bold.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, look.",2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,You wanna get the pit filled in?,2,6
Mark Brendanawicz,Go rent a bulldozer and fill in the freaking pit.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Hey.,2,6
Ann Perkins,What's up?,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Say you had a friend who wanted to do something good, but a little risky, and she was kind of nervous about it, and this friend is me.",2,6
Leslie Knope,What should I do?,2,6
Ann Perkins,Mmm.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"You should do it, and you should ask your friend to help you, because your friend totally has your back.",2,6
Ann Perkins,And that friend is me.,2,6
Leslie Knope,You'll help me?,2,6
Ann Perkins,"Of course, I'll do anything I can to help.",2,6
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.,2,6

Ann Perkins,Is it dangerous?,2,6
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna murder anyone.,2,6
Leslie Knope,It was crazy.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a single permit.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Nobody stamped anything.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"All I did was order a backhoe, and it came with a guy who runs it.",2,6
Leslie Knope,I've never rented a guy before.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I wish I knew about that during prom.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"There was a girl at my prom who was known as ""the back ho.""",2,6
Ann Perkins,Mary Dunbar.,2,6
Ann Perkins,She'd let anyone massage her back.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited we're doing this.,2,6
Leslie Knope,And we're doing it without permission.,2,6
Leslie Knope,We're giving ourselves permission.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Look, I had these hard hats made.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Check it out.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Kick, Ass.",2,6
Ann Perkins,I'll take that one.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann, this is so cool.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Do you feel giddy?,2,6
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud of us.,2,6
Construction Worker,"Miss Montague, you ready?",2,6
Leslie Knope,"I didn't wanna tell him my real name, you know?",2,6
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"First, speech.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Is important moment here.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"We are about to fill this hole now, not with dirt, but with the courage of a thousand lions and the solemn memory of all of our friends who have fallen in this cursed hole.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Dump it!,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!,2,6

Leslie Knope,Oh!,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that beeping was sure annoying.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,But this is even more annoying.,2,6
Ann Perkins,I'll handle this.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"The monitor is not a toy, Andy.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,Anything is a toy if you play with it.,2,6
Ann Perkins,I'll chalk that up to your concussion.,2,6
Ann Perkins,The good news is your CAT scan's clear.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Cool.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I'm really happy you're okay.",2,6
Ann Perkins,"Leslie was worried, too.",2,6
Ann Perkins,We should've checked before to see if you were home.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I told you.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,I moved out of the pit.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,I just had to go back because I forgot my headphones.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Then I laid down on this really comfy tarp, I saw an old cereal box I hadn't read before, so I must have drifted off.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,Next thing you know... Dirt.,2,6
Ann Perkins,Scooch up for one sec.,2,6
Ann Perkins,And back down.,2,6
Ann Perkins,There you go.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Ah!,2,6
Andy Dwyer,That is perfect.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,It's like I'm lying in a cloud.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Ann and Andy, just like old times.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,The pit works in mysterious ways.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry about Andy, but I'm not sorry about what I did.",2,6
Leslie Knope,What's my crime?,2,6
Leslie Knope,I got bold?,2,6
Leslie Knope,And a little negligent?,2,6
Ron Swanson,Knope!,2,6
Ron Swanson,My office!,2,6
Ron Swanson,Now!,2,6
Leslie Knope,Hey.,2,6

Ron Swanson,You don't smoke.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Just asking if I can.,2,6
Ron Swanson,Are you high?,2,6
Leslie Knope,I'm high on kaboom.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.",2,6
Ron Swanson,That's right.,2,6
Ron Swanson,"You never did ask me for permission, did you?",2,6
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'm sorry to burst your ka- bubble, but I just had my ass ka- handed to me by the City Manager.",2,6
Ron Swanson,And now this entire department is ka- screwed.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry.",2,6
Ron Swanson,What the K- [bleep] were you thinking?,2,6
Ron Swanson,I would prefer that she ask me for my permission so I can say no.,2,6
Ron Swanson,I like saying no.,2,6
Ron Swanson,It lowers their enthusiasm.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Hello.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"So, I brought you some clean clothes that I found at my house.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,My sexy sweater.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,It has a hole cut out over the bicep.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.,2,6
Ann Perkins,No problem.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"No, A-Cakes, seriously, thank you.",2,6
Ann Perkins,You're welcome.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,No.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no.",2,6
Ann Perkins,What... What are you... What do you think is happening right now?,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"A tragic accident reignited feelings you thought were long dead, and we are finally back together.",2,6
Ann Perkins,"Andy, we're not back together.",2,6
Ann Perkins,You know that I'm kind of with Mark now.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,Is that still happening?,2,6
Andy Dwyer,I don't get it.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,What does he have that I don't have?,2,6
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,6
Ann Perkins,Everything.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"He has, literally, everything you don't have.",2,6
Ann Perkins,"A job, a car, a steady income, an address, a second pair of shoes, table manners, the ability to say ""tampon"" without giggling.",2,6
Ann Perkins,Mark has his life together.,2,6
Ann Perkins,I'll get you a different nurse.,2,6
Leslie Knope,It's awful what happened to Andy.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes when you make an omelet, you got to break a few eggs.",2,6
Leslie Knope,What's the alternative?,2,6
Leslie Knope,No omelets at all?,2,6
Leslie Knope,Who wants to live in that kind of world?,2,6
Leslie Knope,Maybe birds.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Then all their babies would live.,2,6
Scott Braddock,Miss Knope?,2,6
Scott Braddock,Miss Knope.,2,6
Scott Braddock,Hi.,2,6
Scott Braddock,"Scott Braddock, City Attorney.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Scott.",2,6
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that you were friends with Andy.,2,6
Scott Braddock,I never met him.,2,6
Scott Braddock,What I do know is that he could sue us at the drop of a hat.,2,6
Scott Braddock,"I mean, right now, he's the most dangerous man in Pawnee.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Is that all you lawyers think about?,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Lawsuits, and laws and legalese?",2,6
Scott Braddock,Yes.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can relax.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, ""We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault""",2,6
Scott Braddock,"No, no, no, no.",2,6
Scott Braddock,You can't say any of that.,2,6
Scott Braddock,It admits liability.,2,6
Scott Braddock,"You can't say ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I apologize.""",2,6
Scott Braddock,It implies guilt.,2,6
Leslie Knope,That's insane.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I have to apologize.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Andy was a victim--,2,6
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""victim.""",2,6
Leslie Knope,Of an extremely unfortunate situation.,2,6
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""unfortunate,"" and you can't say ""situation.""",2,6
Leslie Knope,"I can't say the word ""situation""?",2,6
Scott Braddock,No.,2,6
Scott Braddock,It implies there was a situation.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Can I give him the pig?,2,6
Scott Braddock,"Yeah, the pig's fine.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Andy.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie.",2,6

Leslie Knope,"Filled with emotions, as any person would.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,What?,2,6
Scott Braddock,No miming.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Uh... you were in the pit.,2,6
Scott Braddock,We're not conceding that point.,2,6
Leslie Knope,You were in a place.,2,6
Leslie Knope,We're both here now.,2,6
Leslie Knope,The government--,2,6
Scott Braddock,"No, no.",2,6
Scott Braddock,No.,2,6
Scott Braddock,We got to go.,2,6
Leslie Knope,What?,2,6
Scott Braddock,Let's go.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Why?,2,6
Scott Braddock,Wendell Adams.,2,6
Wendell Adams,I'm Andrew's attorney.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Andy, no.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,It's my only option.,2,6
Wendell Adams,"Andy, stop.",2,6
Wendell Adams,I've advised my client not to speak with you.,2,6
Wendell Adams,He's suing the City of Pawnee.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you're suing your hometown?",2,6
Wendell Adams,"Andy, no.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Look, can we just talk about this?",2,6
Scott Braddock,"Leslie, no.",2,6
Leslie Knope,This is terrible.,2,6

Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said it's your only option?,2,6
Leslie Knope,I think we should talk.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Without lawyers present.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna meet, just put a white chalk ""X"" on the mailbox across the street from City Hall.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Or call me back.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Just call me back.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why aren't you returning my calls?",2,6
Leslie Knope,Is it because of your lawyer?,2,6
Leslie Knope,It's because of your lawyer.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy, it's your aunt, your mom or dad's sister.",2,6
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to tell you this but your uncle has passed.,2,6
Leslie Knope,He's with Jesus now.,2,6
Leslie Knope,So we're having a memorial in 30 minutes at City Hall.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Hey!,2,6
Leslie Knope,Free guitars at City Hall!,2,6
Leslie Knope,Everybody run!,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Because of a local disaster, you, Andy Dwyer, must go to the evacuation center at Pawnee City Hall.",2,6
Tom Haverford,Hmm.,2,6
Tom Haverford,That was weird.,2,6
Leslie Knope,How long have you been there?,2,6
Leslie Knope,I promise that Andy isn't suing just for the money.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, the man lived in a pit.",2,6
Ann Perkins,Okay?,2,6
Ann Perkins,"He couldn't find a place to live on the Earth's surface, so he went under the ground.",2,6
Ann Perkins,You're dealing with a grown man who thinks like a gopher.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"I feel like if I could get past the lawyers and find out what's really going on, I think I could get him to drop the lawsuit.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, is that you?",2,6
Ann Perkins,Hey.,2,6
Ann Perkins,We need to talk somewhere private.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh! Baby, I'm back.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Thank you so--,2,6
Ann Perkins,Why are you naked?,2,6
Leslie Knope,Oh!,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Well, because of what you said.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,We're getting back together.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"No, we're not.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, we are.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,You should've heard the super sexy stuff she was saying to me.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"I said, ""Hey, Andy.""",2,6
Ann Perkins,"""It's Ann.""",2,6
Ann Perkins,""" Can we talk at my house?""",2,6
Andy Dwyer,That's not how you said it.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"You were like, ""Hey, Andy.""",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"""It's Ann.""",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"""Can you talk at my house?""",2,6
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you are such a baby.",2,6

Ann Perkins,Good luck.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Where are you--,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann. Just--",2,6
Andy Dwyer,None of your clothes fit me.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,So I'm putting an apron over the front stuff.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Is she gone?,2,6
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said this was your only option?,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm completely broke, and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of 100,000 dollars.",2,6
Leslie Knope,I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"I want Ann back, and she said she really needs a guy with a lot of money.",2,6
Leslie Knope,That doesn't sound like Ann.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I can't really do her voice, but she said she likes Mark because he's a grown-up with a bank account.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,I put two and two together.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"100,000 dollars, I could probably get a bank account.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,Fine.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,I'll get a job.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Ann will respect that.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,I can make six bucks a day playing guitar on the street.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,I can't make six bucks a day.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"I know I just said that maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut.",2,6
Scott Braddock,"Mr. Dwyer, we're very happy that you're dropping the suit.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's really terrific.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,I have my conditions.,2,6
Leslie Knope,No.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Never.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I will not negotiate with greedy street people.,2,6
Scott Braddock,"Wait, Leslie.",2,6
Scott Braddock,Let's hear him out.,2,6
Leslie Knope,We planned this.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,Kaboom.,2,6
Scott Braddock,All right.,2,6
Scott Braddock,What's it gonna take?,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"One, I want that pit filled in, sir.",2,6
Scott Braddock,Is there a two?,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"A guaranteed starting spot in the Indianapolis Colts, inside linebacker.",2,6
Scott Braddock,"Well, we can't accomplish that.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"What do you say, Scott?",2,6
Scott Braddock,Yeah.,2,6
Scott Braddock,"I mean, eventually, we're gonna fill in the pit.",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"""Eventually""?",2,6
Andy Dwyer,I've already been injured in that thing twice.,2,6
Andy Dwyer,"And I could fall in 10 more times by ""eventually.""",2,6
Andy Dwyer,"Every time I walk past that pit, I'm forced to relive the most traumatic two separate days of my life, and wanna sue you again.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say it, but it really seems like Andy has us over a barrel here, Scott.",2,6
Scott Braddock,Yeah.,2,6
Ann Perkins,This is really happening.,2,6
Ann Perkins,I just can't believe it.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, sorry.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Usually, in these situations, a person says ""pinch me.""",2,6
Ann Perkins,Is that Andy?,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yeah.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess.",2,6
Ann Perkins,He settled?,2,6
Leslie Knope,Yup.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Gave up 100,000 dollars probably just for one thing, the city fill in the pit behind your house.",2,6
Ann Perkins,Why?,2,6
Leslie Knope,Who knows? Who knows why that gopher does what he does?,2,6
Andy Dwyer,You always hated this pit!,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, pit.",2,6
Leslie Knope,"Hello, lot.",2,6
Leslie Knope,How does taking risks make me feel? Amazing.,2,6
Leslie Knope,Tingling sensation throughout my whole body.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I feel flushed.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"My muscles are relaxed, yet I feel awake.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Just waves of pleasure.,2,6
Leslie Knope,I wish there was something physical that could make me feel this way.,2,6
Ann Perkins,"Wow, you did it.",2,6
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking what I'm thinking?,2,6
Ann Perkins,There's so much more to do.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're so close.",2,6
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,2,6
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call Kaboom, and check on their availability for next year.",2,6
Ann Perkins,Great.,2,6

Leslie Knope,"Hi, yes, I'd like the number for Kaboom, the national playground building charity.",2,6
Leslie Knope,I hope they can work us in.,2,6
Extra,"Sorry, there's no listing for that name.",2,6
Leslie Knope,What? Are you sure?,2,6
Keef,Kaboom is a word I made up.,2,6
Keef,It's not in any dictionary.,2,6
Keef,I trick people into building playgrounds on empty lots in their neighborhoods.,2,6
Keef,It's an elaborate prank.,2,6
Keef,"For my next prank, I'm going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.",2,6
Keef,They'll never see it coming.,2,6

Leslie Knope,"Then my office gets vandalized, and somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk?",2,7
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a coincidence, Greg.",2,7
Greg Pikitis,"Wow, you nailed me.",2,7
Greg Pikitis,"I mean, there's no way that two different people could have eaten the same fruit in the same day, in the same area of Indiana.",2,7
Greg Pikitis,Never mind that I was actually eating a plum when you saw me earlier.,2,7
Leslie Knope,I know you did this.,2,7
Leslie Knope,I don't care what you say.,2,7
Leslie Knope,I don't care that you were in the parking lot all night.,2,7
Leslie Knope,Somehow you found a way to get in here--,2,7
Greg Pikitis,"Wait, wait, wait.",2,7
Greg Pikitis,How did you know that I was in the parking lot all night?,2,7
Leslie Knope,"Because I followed you, genius!",2,7
Greg Pikitis,If you followed me all night then you know that it wasn't me.,2,7
Greg Pikitis,"Knope, what is your problem?",2,7
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have been very civil.",2,7
Leslie Knope,But I will waterboard you.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,"No, nope.",2,7
Dave Sanderson,I don't think she would make a good cop.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,"I would be frightened to live in a town that she's the cop of, frankly.",2,7
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?,2,7
Tom Haverford,"Ann, do you want me to liven things up or not?",2,7
Ann Perkins,Course I do.,2,7
Tom Haverford,"All right, then relax.",2,7
Tom Haverford,And turn off all the lights that don't have colored bulbs.,2,7
Tom Haverford,"All right, y'all!",2,7
Tom Haverford,Take the pigs in the blanket and put them to sleep!,2,7
Tom Haverford,It's time to get wild!,2,7
Tom Haverford,"Get this furniture out of here, y'all, we're making a dance floor.",2,7
Tom Haverford,"Come on, y'all.",2,7
Tom Haverford,Put the turkey wraps down.,2,7
Tom Haverford,We're about to get wild.,2,7
Tom Haverford,"Ron Swanson's in the building, y'all!",2,7
Leslie Knope,His mom's gonna be here soon.,2,7

Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, this is Officer Sanderson.",2,7
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI.",2,7
Greg's Mom,What the hell do you think you're doing?,2,7
Greg's Mom,You can't just hold a 16 year old kid against his will.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,"Well, we were trying to question him about this vandalism.",2,7
Greg's Mom,Do you have any evidence?,2,7
Leslie Knope,Yes.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,No.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,No.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,We don't.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"Two words, peach pit.",2,7
Greg's Mom,Peach pit?,2,7
Leslie Knope,"His DNA is all over it, I assume.",2,7
Dave Sanderson,We don't know that.,2,7
Leslie Knope,We can get it tested.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,We can't.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"And if it matches your DNA, then you're going away for a long time.",2,7
Dave Sanderson,It won't.,2,7
Greg's Mom,Is this a joke?,2,7
Leslie Knope,No.,2,7
Greg's Mom,I'm calling your shift commander.,2,7
Greg's Mom,"Monday morning, I am calling your boss.",2,7
Greg's Mom,I don't know who to call about you--,2,7
Andy Dwyer,The President of the United States of America.,2,7
Greg's Mom,Fine.,2,7
Greg's Mom,"And if any of you ever come near my son again, I swear to God I will sue you and everyone in this building.",2,7
Greg's Mom,"Come on, honey.",2,7
Leslie Knope,Let them think they've lost us.,2,7
Leslie Knope,Then we're--,2,7
Leslie Knope,Where are you going?,2,7
Dave Sanderson,I gotta go tell my boss why I illegally detained a teenager.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,I shouldn't have gotten involved with this.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,It's just... It's just bad police work.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it was bad FBI work, too.",2,7
Andy Dwyer,My bad.,2,7
Tom Haverford,"Tonight, the ""T"" in T-Pain stands for Tom Haverford!",2,7
Tom Haverford,Nurses versus doctors.,2,7

Tom Haverford,Go!,2,7
Tom Haverford,Vodka!,2,7
All,Go!,2,7

Ben,Thanks.,2,7
Ron Swanson,"Damn, that's good.",2,7
Ron Swanson,Nice party.,2,7
Ann Perkins,Thanks.,2,7
Leslie Knope,Why would anyone do this?,2,7
Andy Dwyer,Kids are kids.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,Everybody does stupid stuff like this in high school.,2,7
Leslie Knope,I didn't.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but you were probably a nerd, though, huh?",2,7
Leslie Knope,Hey.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I mean that in a good way.",2,7
Andy Dwyer,Look at you now.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,You're the coolest person I've ever met.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,I even met John Cougar Mellencamp once.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why don't you go home?",2,7
Leslie Knope,I'll finish cleaning this up.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,No way.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you got me a job and you're helping me turn my life around.",2,7
Andy Dwyer,I go home when you go home.,2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, it's city planning.",2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mostly like regulating things and just making sure people obey the city code.,2,7
Nurse,You wanna get out of here?,2,7
Nurse,Go back to my place?,2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,What?,2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm dating Ann.,2,7
Nurse,Good.,2,7
Nurse,That was a test.,2,7
Nurse,You passed.,2,7
Nurse,"Let's celebrate you passing the test, over a drink, at my place.",2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,Still no.,2,7
Nurse,You passed the second test.,2,7
Nurse,But we're still watching you.,2,7

Ron Swanson,"Well, you and Tom really turned the party around.",2,7
Wendy,We have a good time together.,2,7
Wendy,Tom told me that you know about our green card marriage.,2,7
Wendy,And I just want to say thank you for not telling anyone.,2,7
Ron Swanson,No worries.,2,7
Ron Swanson,I'd hate for you to have to go back to Canada.,2,7
Ron Swanson,All that socialized medicine up there.,2,7
Tom Haverford,Wendylicious.,2,7
Tom Haverford,Where have you been?,2,7
Wendy,I was just thanking Ron.,2,7
Wendy,"For, you know, not telling anyone.",2,7
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah.",2,7
Tom Haverford,Thank you.,2,7
Tom Haverford,That was cool of you.,2,7
Wendy,"You know, you won't have to keep it a secret much longer, because in a few months we can split up without raising any eyebrows.",2,7
Wendy,And we'll invite you to the divorce party.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"Huh, maybe Greg is innocent.",2,7
Leslie Knope,"If that's the case, then there's another kid out there who's tormenting me.",2,7
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.,2,7
Leslie Knope,I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country.,2,7
Leslie Knope,That's the cornerstone of democracy.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,Sure.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"On the other hand, Greg Pikitis is a little punk.",2,7
Leslie Knope,And I kind of wanna TP his house.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait! This is fun! This is fun! What do I do?",2,7
Andy Dwyer,"You just grab the toilet paper, unroll it a little bit like this, and throw it on the tree.",2,7
Leslie Knope,This is for Mayor Percy! This is for the Parks Department office! This is for pooping on the handball court!,2,7
Leslie Knope,Yeah! This is really fun! But I don't condone it!,2,7
Ann Perkins,"Bye, guys.",2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,Bye.,2,7
Ann Perkins,"You're the man, Swanson.",2,7

Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",2,7
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no.",2,7
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, I think we have the wrong house.",2,7
Greg's Mom,Why are you doing this?,2,7
Leslie Knope,"It's really hard to explain, but we were trying to get revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and we thought this was his house, but I guess we got the address wrong.",2,7
Greg's Mom,I'm Greg's mom.,2,7
Leslie Knope,You are?,2,7
Greg's Mom,Yes.,2,7
Greg's Mom,Oh.,2,7
Greg's Mom,"Did he hire a fake mom again, to get him out of trouble?",2,7
Leslie Knope,What?,2,7
Greg's Mom,"Whenever he gets in trouble, he goes on Craigslist and hires a woman to play his mother and bail him out.",2,7
Greg's Mom,"Oh, that little SOB! Greg! Gregory!",2,7
Leslie Knope,I knew it!,2,7
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, my God.",2,7
Andy Dwyer,Dude.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,That kid is amazing.,2,7

Leslie Knope,Make sure you--,2,7
Extra,"I need more, man.",2,7
Dave Sanderson,Hey!,2,7
Leslie Knope,Let them go! Stay on the leader!,2,7
Greg's Mom,I am gonna wring your neck!,2,7
Leslie Knope,How did you get into the Parks Department? I have to know.,2,7
Greg Pikitis,Maybe the FBI can figure it out.,2,7
Andy Dwyer,"I'm not even in the FBI, stupid.",2,7
Greg Pikitis,"Wow, you're amazing.",2,7
Leslie Knope,Hey! You're going to jail for a very long time.,2,7
Greg Pikitis,You can't--,2,7
Dave Sanderson,"He's not gonna go to jail, you know.",2,7
Dave Sanderson,He's a minor.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll let the jury decide.",2,7
Dave Sanderson,There's not gonna be a jury--,2,7
Leslie Knope,Then the judge will decide where he goes.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,Look.,2,7
Dave Sanderson,"He's going to do probation, he's a minor.",2,7
Leslie Knope,"Dave, just let me have this.",2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow.,2,7
Mark Brendanawicz,"Nice work, Knope.",2,7
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,2,7
Ann Perkins,That is amazing.,2,7
Leslie Knope,Thanks.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"But the thing that's driving me nuts is, how did he do it?",2,7
Ann Perkins,"If you destroy him early, please come by.",2,7
Leslie Knope,I will.,2,7
Ann Perkins,How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?,2,7
Jerry Gergich,Oh! What the... Are you,2,7
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we were here all afternoon.",2,7
Leslie Knope,"How did he get in? First of all, we always lock the doors when we leave.",2,7
Leslie Knope,And Dave and I tailed Pikitis from the moment he left his house at 7:00 p.m. to the moment we came back here.,2,7
Leslie Knope,"Does he have a lookalike or something? Did he have an accomplice? I mean, did he have help? How did that little turd do it?",2,7

Ron Swanson,"""Thank you, Old Gus, for brightening our lives, our hearts, and most importantly, our shoes.""",2,8
Leslie Knope,This truly is a day of mixed emotions for me.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"I'm sad that Old Gus is leaving, but it allows me to help Andy restart his life as Pioneer Hall's new shoeshine guy.",2,8
Old Gus,"Well, I've been listening to your boring speeches for the last 50 years, and now it's time for you to listen to one of mine.",2,8
Old Gus,"You know, a day like this makes a man reflect upon his life, and I've come to the conclusion that I've completely wasted mine.",2,8
Old Gus,"And just for the record, I never ever liked being called ""Old Gus.""",2,8
Old Gus,"I didn't understand it when I was in my 20s, and I sure hate it now.",2,8
Old Gus,"So go to hell, every single one of you.",2,8
Old Gus,"Screw Pawnee, and screw your damn shoes.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,That's classic.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"So, I propose that we change our name from the Subcommittee for Pit Beautification to the Subcommittee for Lot Beautification.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"April, stop that.",2,8
Leslie Knope,Who are you texting?,2,8
April Ludgate,You.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Aw.,2,8
Leslie Knope,She's texting me.,2,8
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry you're bored.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, hey, everyone.",2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, hey, Ann.",2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, can I talk to you for a minute?",2,8
Leslie Knope,Fine.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge.",2,8
Leslie Knope,Keep the momentum going.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Keep these minds working.,2,8
Tom Haverford,"Absolutely, chief.",2,8
Tom Haverford,Okay.,2,8
Tom Haverford,"Would you rather be able to fly, or speak fluent French?",2,8
Tom Haverford,"Donna, go.",2,8
Donna Meagle,French.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't wanna freak you out, but another department filed a planning claim for Lot 48.",2,8
Leslie Knope,Who?,2,8
Leslie Knope,No.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Damn it.,2,8
Leslie Knope,The library?,2,8
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"They're like a biker gang, but instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing.",2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,It's gonna be okay.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not a done deal.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right.",2,8
Leslie Knope,Thanks for pulling me out of there.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"I need a good plan, though.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't wanna cause a panic.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"News flash, we're screwed.",2,8
Leslie Knope,We got a big problem with the library.,2,8
Tom Haverford,Punkass book jockeys.,2,8
Ann Perkins,Wait.,2,8
Ann Perkins,Why do we hate the library?,2,8
Leslie Knope,The library is the worst group of people ever assembled in history.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"They're mean, conniving, rude, and extremely well read, which makes them very dangerous.",2,8
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to steal Lot 48 for a new branch.,2,8
All,What?,2,8
Donna Meagle,Get out of here.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,8
Jerry Gergich,On 48?,2,8
Ann Perkins,I actually think a library would be nice that close to my house.,2,8
April Ludgate,Let's bring the library down.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,8
Ann Perkins,But I'm not about to say that in there.,2,8
Tom Haverford,A new branch?,2,8
Leslie Knope,Jerks.,2,8
Jerry Gergich,You're kidding.,2,8
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I hate them.",2,8
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,8
Leslie Knope,We need to make contact with someone there.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Does anybody know anybody that works at the library?,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, we actually kind of do.",2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,The new Deputy Director of the department is Tammy Swanson.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Ron's ex-wife?,2,8
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Or is that awful?,2,8
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he hates her, but he knows her.",2,8
Leslie Knope,Everything's okay.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Or is it just the same?,2,8
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you're thinking out loud again.",2,8
Leslie Knope,Am I?,2,8
Leslie Knope,I am.,2,8
Ron Swanson,Of course.,2,8
Ron Swanson,That bitch of an ex-wife is working for the library now.,2,8
Ron Swanson,That is perfect.,2,8
Ron Swanson,The worst person in the world working at the worst place in the world.,2,8
Leslie Knope,I have to go talk to her.,2,8
Leslie Knope,And you got to give me something I can use.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Does she have any weaknesses?,2,8
Ron Swanson,No.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, no?",2,8
Leslie Knope,Everybody has a weakness.,2,8
Ron Swanson,Not machines.,2,8
Ron Swanson,I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.,2,8
Leslie Knope,I see.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and--",2,8
Ron Swanson,Nope.,2,8
Ron Swanson,I hate them both.,2,8
Ron Swanson,"On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my ex-wives rushed to my side, so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time.",2,8
Ron Swanson,Would I get married again?,2,8
Ron Swanson,"Oh, absolutely.",2,8
Ron Swanson,"If you don't believe in love, what's the point of living?",2,8
Leslie Knope,I'm just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with Tammy about the relative merits of parks versus libraries.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"And in case something bad goes down, I wore my sharpest rings.",2,8
Leslie Knope,This one will tear you up.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Hello?,2,8
Leslie Knope,Hi.,2,8
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.,2,8
Leslie Knope,I called a little while ago.,2,8
Tammy 2,You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?,2,8
Tammy 2,"You have overdue book fees totaling 3 dollars, missy.",2,8
Leslie Knope,That is so typical.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that.",2,8
Tammy 2,No--,2,8
Leslie Knope,That's why everybody hates the library.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Here.,2,8
Leslie Knope,You know what?,2,8
Leslie Knope,Here's your 3 dollars.,2,8
Tammy 2,"Leslie, no--",2,8
Leslie Knope,And I'll see you in hell.,2,8
Tammy 2,"Leslie, Leslie, Leslie.",2,8
Tammy 2,I'm just kidding.,2,8
Tammy 2,"My gosh, I mean, you did have 3 dollars worth of fines, but I cleared them.",2,8
Tammy 2,"We government gals have to watch each other's backs, right?",2,8
Leslie Knope,I know this is a trap.,2,8
Leslie Knope,But I don't know how.,2,8
Tammy 2,Okay.,2,8
Tammy 2,Did you talk to Ron?,2,8
Tammy 2,Ron tends to exaggerate when it comes to me.,2,8
Tammy 2,I swear I don't have cloven feet.,2,8
Tammy 2,Please.,2,8
Tammy 2,Sit down.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Shine, shine, shine your shoes.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say, sir?",2,8
Andy Dwyer,Ma'am?,2,8
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine?,2,8
Andy Dwyer,I won't look up your skirt.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,Ann.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,Crazy.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?,2,8
Andy Dwyer,It's me.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, Andy.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,"So, Ann, how you been?",2,8
Ann Perkins,Good.,2,8
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Leslie told me you were working here now.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I just joined the rat race.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,Chasing the cheese.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Racing the rats, trying to get the cheese.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,Enough technical business talk.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,You look ravishing.,2,8
Ann Perkins,"Not a lot of customers, huh?",2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, business is a little slow.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,It is definitely due to the economy.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,I've been hearing a lot of people say that a lot about a lot of stuff.,2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, Mark.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,You want those shoes shined?,2,8
Andy Dwyer,I'll give you a discount because you're a friend of Ann's.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I'm more than a friend of Ann's.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,Not for long.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,Sorry?,2,8
Ann Perkins,I don't know.,2,8
Ann Perkins,At least he finally has a real job.,2,8
Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, the only job he had was sending audition tapes to Survivor and Deal or No Deal.",2,8
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer, and I would be a perfect contestant for Deal or No Deal.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"I want it to be a perfect park with a state-of-the-art swing set, and basketball courts, and off to the side, a lovely sitting area for kids with asthma to watch other kids play.",2,8
Tammy 2,Wow.,2,8
Tammy 2,"If I'd had a park like that when I was growing up, I probably wouldn't have gone through such a prolonged mall slut phase.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the goal, Tammy.",2,8
Tammy 2,"Listen, you guys got there first.",2,8
Tammy 2,"I'm gonna withdraw my request for the lot, as a professional courtesy to you.",2,8
Tammy 2,"Government gals, right?",2,8
Leslie Knope,Government gals.,2,8
Ron Swanson,So you talked to Tammy?,2,8
Ron Swanson,What's it like to stare into the eye of Satan's butthole?,2,8
Leslie Knope,"She's changed, Ron.",2,8
Leslie Knope,She's a different person.,2,8
Leslie Knope,I think it would be healthy for you to get a sense of closure.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Look at Mark and me.,2,8
Leslie Knope,We slept together.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"We talked about it, we're still friends.",2,8
Ron Swanson,You slept with Brendanawicz?,2,8
Leslie Knope,No.,2,8
Ron Swanson,"Look, Tammy and I don't work.",2,8
Ron Swanson,We are oil and water.,2,8
Ron Swanson,"Or oil, and TNT, and C4, and a detonator, and a butane torch.",2,8
Ron Swanson,Nothing good will come... Wait.,2,8
Ron Swanson,"She's here, isn't she?",2,8
Tammy 2,"Hi, Ron.",2,8
Ron Swanson,Tammy.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Good.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Good start.,2,8
Tammy 2,"I'm sorry about this, but I just really wanna talk to you.",2,8
Tammy 2,Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?,2,8
Ron Swanson,Let's get this over with.,2,8
Tammy 2,"Thanks, Ron.",2,8
Tammy 2,It means a lot.,2,8
Tammy 2,You're a miracle worker.,2,8
Leslie Knope,Oh.,2,8
Donna Meagle,Do you know what you just did?,2,8
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Donna.",2,8
Leslie Knope,I got two people to put aside years of hostility and open a door to the possibility of friendship.,2,8
Donna Meagle,You were not here when Ron and Tammy got divorced.,2,8
Donna Meagle,I was.,2,8
Donna Meagle,Those two are crazy.,2,8
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,2,8
Tom Haverford,And you just opened the gates to Crazytown.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I think Ron was acting like a baby, a little bit.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what is he afraid of?",2,8
Leslie Knope,Tammy's just a woman.,2,8
Leslie Knope,A nice woman.,2,8
Leslie Knope,"You know, she's not a murderer.",2,8
Leslie Knope,She's not a dragon.,2,8
Tammy 2,"It's really good to see you, Ron.",2,8
Ron Swanson,You've aged horribly.,2,8
Tammy 2,You son of a bitch.,2,8
Ron Swanson,That didn't take long.,2,8
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God.",2,8
Tammy 2,What is your problem?,2,8
Tammy 2,"Nothing's changed, has it?",2,8
Tammy 2,"Who set the bed on fire, huh?",2,8
Waiter,"Excuse me, folks.",2,8
Ron Swanson,I did.,2,8
Ron Swanson,Okay?,2,8
Ron Swanson,Is that what you wanna hear?,2,8
Waiter,"Please, folks.",2,8
Ron Swanson,We're fine.,2,8
Ron Swanson,We're fine.,2,8
Tammy 2,Okay.,2,8
Tammy 2,I'm so sorry.,2,8
Waiter,Please.,2,8
Ron Swanson,Fine.,2,8
Ron Swanson,Take it easy.,2,8
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God.",2,8
Leslie Knope,"When you meddle in someone's personal life, it's just so rewarding.",2,8
Tammy 2,"Oh, God, yes.",2,8
Tammy 2,"Oh, God.",2,8
Tammy 2,"Oh, wow.",2,8
Tammy 2,Yeah.,2,8
Waiter,Sir.,2,8

Leslie Knope,"No, he doesn't.",2,8
Tammy 2,I'm pretty sure he does.,2,8
Leslie Knope,See?,2,8
Leslie Knope,He's completely over you.,2,8
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I understand that this Ann situation is awkward.",2,8

Leslie Knope,I'm sure that's not true.,2,8
Ron Swanson,"You see the kind of women that I choose, right? Look, just wait for me downstairs.",2,8

Ron Swanson,She's a grade A bitch.,2,8
Leslie Knope,There we go.,2,8
Ron Swanson,"Every time she laughs, an angel dies.",2,8

Paul,Chocolate pudding.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Huh.,2,9
Leslie Knope,That's new.,2,9
Leslie Knope,The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.,2,9
Leslie Knope,And it's very controversial.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Someone tried to stab it once.,2,9
Leslie Knope,We really need better security here.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"We also need better, less offensive history.",2,9
Paul,"So, the city council has decided that The Spirit of Pawnee should be changed to something just a little less horrifying.",2,9
Paul,"Now, since the murals were made by government employees back in the 1930s, we thought it might be fun if each department submitted a design for a new mural.",2,9
Paul,And you'll submit your concepts tomorrow afternoon.,2,9
Paul,"All righty, folks?",2,9
Paul,Thank you very much.,2,9
Joe From Sewage,"Hey, Leslie.",2,9

Joe From Sewage,Let's roll.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Damn!,2,9
Tom Haverford,How does Sewage always get the hottest interns?,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever.",2,9
Leslie Knope,This could be our legacy.,2,9
Ann Perkins,I thought building a park on Lot 48 was going to be our legacy.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can have two legacies.",2,9

Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's not true, Donna.",2,9
Leslie Knope,I've seen your fingernails.,2,9
Donna Meagle,"Um, I pay someone to do this.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Really?,2,9

Leslie Knope,"So, here are your supplies.",2,9
Leslie Knope,I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.,2,9

Leslie Knope,And you have one hour.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Designers.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Make it work.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Tim Gunn.,2,9

Artist,Tell me about yourself.,2,9
Tom Haverford,No.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Just paint.,2,9
Tom Haverford,I have no interest in art.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Let me clarify.,2,9
Tom Haverford,I have no interest in non-nude images.,2,9
Tom Haverford,"Dude, what the hell kind of art is this?",2,9
Tom Haverford,It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles.,2,9
Artist,I'm an abstract expressionist.,2,9

Tom Haverford,And I'm a guy that's out 20 bucks.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Ugh.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Whatever.,2,9

Ann Perkins,"But the Parks Department has done so much for me that if I can help them out in any way, I will.",2,9
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God.",2,9
Ann Perkins,Maybe I should just give them all free flu shots.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I know everything about this town and these murals.,2,9
Leslie Knope,And that's why this is a dream come true.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Literally.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I have had a dream where I designed a mural.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"At one point, Gina Gershon was there.",2,9
April Ludgate,My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.,2,9

Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go first.",2,9
Ann Perkins,Okay.,2,9
Ann Perkins,Um... Okay.,2,9
Ann Perkins,"Well, since it's the Parks Department, I thought I would design a pretty park.",2,9
Ann Perkins,With dogs playing.,2,9
Ann Perkins,"And I can't really draw, so I just cut some stuff out of a magazine.",2,9
Tom Haverford,That looks like something a death row convict would make in art therapy.,2,9
Ann Perkins,"Dude, I tried.",2,9
Tom Haverford,And you failed.,2,9
Ann Perkins,It's dogs and people playing in a park.,2,9
Ann Perkins,It's cute.,2,9
Tom Haverford,"It's okay, sweetheart.",2,9
Tom Haverford,"You can't make art, because you are art.",2,9

Tom Haverford,"Over here, you've got some shapes.",2,9
Tom Haverford,"And then you come over to this side... You know, it's actually kind of interesting.",2,9
Tom Haverford,Each shape is its own thing.,2,9
Tom Haverford,"But then when it comes together, it really gives you a sense of... completion.",2,9
Tom Haverford,Hmm.,2,9
Tom Haverford,A piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Is that normal?,2,9
Donna Meagle,"So, it's the Last Supper, but with famous people from Indiana.",2,9
Donna Meagle,"John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, uh, David Letterman, Vivica A. Fox.",2,9
Donna Meagle,"Okay, so, here's where it gets a little dicey.",2,9
Donna Meagle,Because there's not that many celebrities from Indiana.,2,9
Donna Meagle,"So, a NASCAR.",2,9
Donna Meagle,"Uh, my friend, Becky.",2,9
Donna Meagle,Ron Swanson.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Donna?,2,9
Leslie Knope,Who's the Jesus?,2,9
Donna Meagle,That would be Greg Kinnear.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I didn't know he was from Indiana.,2,9
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you know, I read that he was.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Oh.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?,2,9
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he was great on ER.",2,9
Tom Haverford,Greg Kinnear wasn't in ER.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he was.",2,9
Ann Perkins,I don't think that he was.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Who am I thinking of?,2,9
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Next?,2,9
Leslie Knope,Wow.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Really good, Jerry.",2,9
Jerry Gergich,"For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma.",2,9
Tom Haverford,"You said ""murinal.""",2,9
Jerry Gergich,"She... No, I didn't.",2,9
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did.",2,9
Ann Perkins,"You said ""murinal.""",2,9
Ann Perkins,I heard it.,2,9
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, she--",2,9
April Ludgate,Jerry.,2,9
April Ludgate,Why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?,2,9
Tom Haverford,Jerry.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Go to the doctor.,2,9
Tom Haverford,You might have a murinary tract infection.,2,9
Jerry Gergich,I just wanted to show you my art.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Murinal!,2,9
Tom Haverford,Murinal!,2,9
Tom Haverford,Murinal!,2,9
Leslie Knope,Disqualified!,2,9
Jerry Gergich,It's pointillism.,2,9
Jerry Gergich,And each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town.,2,9
Tom Haverford,No one cares.,2,9
Tom Haverford,At all.,2,9
April Ludgate,Okay.,2,9
April Ludgate,"So, this is a multimedia project.",2,9
April Ludgate,"First, a bunch of rats made out of garbage.",2,9
April Ludgate,And this is a TV screen.,2,9
April Ludgate,"It'll be like a big, flatscreen TV, and it will play looped video of knee surgeries.",2,9
April Ludgate,And then this is a human-sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one.,2,9
April Ludgate,"And it will be spinning and there will be, like, a fat guy in it all the time, like, screaming and, like, eating raw beef and, like, bleeding.",2,9
April Ludgate,"And, like, blood will, like, come out of his mouth and stuff.",2,9
April Ludgate,"And that'll be, like, right next to the mural.",2,9
Leslie Knope,I have one question.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Why?,2,9
April Ludgate,"If you have to ask, you don't get it.",2,9
Leslie Knope,I don't think they really got the assignment.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Like the Mona Lisa.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Or the music of Squeeze.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"June 8, 1922.",2,9
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.,2,9
Leslie Knope,We lost a lot of good bread that day.,2,9
Leslie Knope,As well as several human lives.,2,9
Leslie Knope,And it also made the whole town smell like toast.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Which one resident described as ""disturbingly enticing.""",2,9
Leslie Knope,But I digress.,2,9
Leslie Knope,The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Why would you want a mural that shows people dying when you could have shapes that come alive?,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history.",2,9
Leslie Knope,And people love voting for tragedy.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Look at the Oscars.,2,9
Leslie Knope,This is our Holocaust movie.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"This is our ""English Patient.""",2,9
Ann Perkins,It sounds like you're exploiting the tragedy.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"See, Ann gets it.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Time to vote, everybody.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Cast your votes.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"May the best, most tragic project win.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural.",2,9
Leslie Knope,And then those six voices came together as a team.,2,9
Leslie Knope,There are no losers today.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"But there is one winner, us.",2,9
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Tom, the results of the vote, please.",2,9
Tom Haverford,One to one to one to one to one to one.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?",2,9
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,9
Andy Dwyer,Third time today.,2,9
Ron Swanson,Mmm.,2,9
Ron Swanson,That's a good shoeshine.,2,9
Andy Dwyer,What the [bleep] man?,2,9
Ron Swanson,I I don't know what happened.,2,9
Ron Swanson,Frankly.,2,9
Ron Swanson,I emitted a noise.,2,9
Ron Swanson,The noise was involuntary.,2,9
Ron Swanson,"Sometimes, a sound is just a sound.",2,9
Ron Swanson,You know?,2,9
Leslie Knope,We need to whittle these down.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?,2,9
April Ludgate,Ann's blows.,2,9
Ann Perkins,Wow.,2,9
Ann Perkins,Don't hold back.,2,9
April Ludgate,"No offense, but it's a giant picture of a park.",2,9
April Ludgate,That's not art.,2,9
Ann Perkins,"Well, at least it's not a fat human hamster eating meat.",2,9
April Ludgate,You don't even work here.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you both have a point.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"Ann, yours was a little trite.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit.",2,9
April Ludgate,Thank you.,2,9
Tom Haverford,"Look, there's something about those shapes.",2,9
Tom Haverford,There's some emotional art right there.,2,9
April Ludgate,Any kid could do that.,2,9
Tom Haverford,No kid could do that.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Only God could do that.,2,9
Donna Meagle,What is so great about the shapes?,2,9
Leslie Knope,"He likes the shapes, okay?",2,9
Leslie Knope,And he's part of the team.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"So, here.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.,2,9
Leslie Knope,And then we'll put them on a new team mural.,2,9
Leslie Knope,We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.,2,9
Leslie Knope,It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Imagine how good that painting would be.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I think it's really good.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Brendanawicz!,2,9
Leslie Knope,We need you for something.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Can it wait?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,I am so swamped here.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Ann's in trouble.,2,9
Leslie Knope,We think it might be pills.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,What?,2,9
Leslie Knope,No.,2,9
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.,2,9
Leslie Knope,But this is just as important.,2,9
Leslie Knope,We need you to look at a piece of art.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, God.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,What is that?,2,9
Leslie Knope,This is our entry for the mural contest.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you made a camel.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,You've never heard that saying?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,The camel was actually a horse designed by a committee.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,And what you guys have here is one ugly camel.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Featuring Bill Paxton.,2,9
Donna Meagle,Greg Kinnear.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Greg Kinnear.,2,9
Donna Meagle,Oh!,2,9
Donna Meagle,Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?,2,9
Leslie Knope,You have to save us.,2,9
Leslie Knope,You have to design something.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, I'm not an artist.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are.",2,9
Leslie Knope,I've seen you sketch things.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah, like poles for stop signs.",2,9
Leslie Knope,That everybody stops and looks at.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"By law, Leslie.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,They're required to.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Look, Mark.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Please.,2,9
Leslie Knope,You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I know you'll do something good.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"And I really, really want to win this.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Please?,2,9
Leslie Knope,What are you going to do tonight?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,I was going to go to Arby's and watch Frontline.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Here we go.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, it is an old man feeding pigeons in a park.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh... The spirit of Pawnee?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe?,2,9
Tom Haverford,You got to be kidding me.,2,9
Ann Perkins,How is that better than my park scene?,2,9
April Ludgate,It isn't.,2,9
April Ludgate,And that's saying something.,2,9
Donna Meagle,And who's the man?,2,9
Donna Meagle,Is he famous?,2,9
Donna Meagle,Is it Martin Landau?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I have no dog in this fight.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm just saying that this will win.,2,9
Tom Haverford,It's nothing.,2,9
Tom Haverford,It's mush.,2,9
Tom Haverford,"There's not even one shape in there, Mark.",2,9
Tom Haverford,Where are the shapes?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not saying that this is any good.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm saying that this will win.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mass appeal.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's like what motels put up, and it hangs there for years, and no one ever throws acid at it.",2,9
Ron Swanson,Mmm.,2,9
Ron Swanson,Who did this?,2,9
Ron Swanson,I like it.,2,9
Ann Perkins,Seriously?,2,9
Ann Perkins,I mean... Sorry.,2,9
Ron Swanson,Yeah.,2,9
Ron Swanson,It comforts me.,2,9
Ron Swanson,That'll win.,2,9
Tom Haverford,This is garbage.,2,9
Tom Haverford,We've got to go back to the shapes.,2,9
April Ludgate,No.,2,9
April Ludgate,This is boring.,2,9
April Ludgate,We got to go back to the garbage.,2,9
Ann Perkins,I would take the shapes over this.,2,9
Ann Perkins,"I mean, come on.",2,9
Donna Meagle,I wouldn't take the shapes over anything.,2,9
Donna Meagle,I'd take Jerry's murinal over this.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"No, guys.",2,9
Leslie Knope,This is the one.,2,9
Tom Haverford,What?,2,9
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Mark's right.,2,9
Tom Haverford,This is an outrage.,2,9
Tom Haverford,Mark's not even in the department.,2,9
Ann Perkins,Right.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Neither is Ann.,2,9
Tom Haverford,But Ann's hot.,2,9
Tom Haverford,And that counts for something.,2,9
April Ludgate,"Whatever happened to, ""We're the Parks Department!""",2,9
April Ludgate,"""Rah rah rah!""",2,9
April Ludgate,"""Down with the Sewage Department!""",2,9
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we spent all day here for no reason.",2,9
Leslie Knope,We have a reason.,2,9
Leslie Knope,We're going to win.,2,9
Leslie Knope,That's our reason.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Our designs are not going to win.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Mark's might win.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"How great would it be if we won, you guys?",2,9
Leslie Knope,"You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win.",2,9
Leslie Knope,We're going with this one.,2,9
Leslie Knope,All right.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"That is an order, team.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Go team!,2,9
Leslie Knope,Team dismissed.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are a team.",2,9
Leslie Knope,But I am the team leader.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"So, I made a bold decision.",2,9
Leslie Knope,We're playing it safe.,2,9
Joe From Sewage,"Hey, Knope.",2,9
Joe From Sewage,How's life in the Parks Defartment?,2,9
Leslie Knope,Better than life in the Sewage Defartment.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Which makes more sense.,2,9
Joe From Sewage,Whatever.,2,9
Joe From Sewage,You guys are screwed.,2,9
Joe From Sewage,Get used to this.,2,9
Joe From Sewage,Because it's going to be hanging on the wall right outside your door for the next 100 years.,2,9
Leslie Knope,That was pretty good.,2,9
Leslie Knope,You think they're going to win?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,They went super patriotic.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a classic mistake.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"It seems crowd pleasing, but it's still a stance.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,"And in government, there's always someone who will oppose a stance.",2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Us?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Old man feeding pigeons?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,No stance.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely no point of view whatsoever.,2,9
Leslie Knope,No point of view.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Smart.,2,9
Ron Swanson,No.,2,9
Ron Swanson,I haven't been back.,2,9
Ron Swanson,I wish him good luck in his business.,2,9
Ron Swanson,"And yes, I will absolutely go back to get my shoes shined soon.",2,9
Ron Swanson,"I don't, frankly, see why this is a topic for discussion.",2,9
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, Ron.",2,9
Andy Dwyer,What's up?,2,9
Ron Swanson,"Uh Andy, you know, the thing the other day?",2,9
Andy Dwyer,"Other day, other day... Yeah.",2,9
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yesterday?",2,9
Ron Swanson,I am... That... That... Was... I feel--,2,9
Andy Dwyer,"I'm okay-- You know, I'd be okay if we... I'd be okay if we never mentioned it again.",2,9
Ron Swanson,Never mention what again?,2,9
Andy Dwyer,"The moan, Ron.",2,9
Andy Dwyer,The weird moan you made.,2,9
Andy Dwyer,That was super weird.,2,9
Andy Dwyer,Do you not remember that? I talked about it with the lady who went after you for a half an hour.,2,9
Andy Dwyer,She said she thought it was an animal--,2,9
Ron Swanson,Okay.,2,9
Ron Swanson,It was just an odd moment.,2,9
Ron Swanson,"Let's just, let's just not talk about it anymore.",2,9
Andy Dwyer,That's what I was trying to say.,2,9
Andy Dwyer,"But, yeah.",2,9
Andy Dwyer,Okay.,2,9
Ron Swanson,Okay.,2,9
Andy Dwyer,Good time.,2,9
Chief Konner,Ms. Knope.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Chief Konner.,2,9
Leslie Knope,What do you got there?,2,9
Chief Konner,"Well, we aren't really artists.",2,9
Chief Konner,But we gave it a shot.,2,9
Chief Konner,"It's your basic dogs playing poker, but with an everything's on fire theme.",2,9
Chief Konner,This is my nephew over here.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Hmm.,2,9
Chief Konner,And this is an attractive lady with a hamburger for a head.,2,9
Chief Konner,"Just some stuff we liked, you know? Anyway, we had a lot of fun putting it together.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"Well, good luck.",2,9
Chief Konner,Thanks.,2,9
Chief Konner,We think it's a winner.,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Go ahead.,2,9
Leslie Knope,What?,2,9
Mark Brendanawicz,Camel's way more fun.,2,9
Leslie Knope,I want my team back.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"And my team made this hot, crazy camel mess.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"So, this is what we're going to submit.",2,9
Leslie Knope,Even if it means we lose.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"God, I hope we win.",2,9
Leslie Knope,But we're definitely going to lose.,2,9
Ann Perkins,Probably.,2,9
Leslie Knope,All right.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Let's get in there and show them how Parks gets it done.,2,9
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,9
Ann Perkins,And Ann.,2,9
Ann Perkins,How Ann gets it done.,2,9
Donna Meagle,Yes!,2,9
Tom Haverford,Let's go!,2,9
Paul,What are the shapes?,2,9
Ann Perkins,"The shapes are awesome, is what they are.",2,9
Ann Perkins,You can't handle it.,2,9
Paul,"No, I actually like them.",2,9
Extra,Forgive me.,2,9
Extra,Is that Michael Jackson?,2,9
Donna Meagle,Yes.,2,9
Donna Meagle,The pride of Indiana.,2,9
April Ludgate,That's right.,2,9
April Ludgate,"So, it's relevant.",2,9
Extra,Who is he carrying?,2,9
Leslie Knope,Jesus Greg Kinnear.,2,9
Paul,"You know, it looks like he's carrying Kinnear into the burning building.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's because he's moonwalking.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"So, he should be going the other way.",2,9
Leslie Knope,That did not occur to me.,2,9
April Ludgate,Sorry.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"So, there you go.",2,9
Leslie Knope,The Spirit of Pawnee.,2,9
Leslie Knope,We didn't win.,2,9
Leslie Knope,But neither did anyone else.,2,9
Leslie Knope,They realized it was going to cost a ton of money to hire a muralist.,2,9
Leslie Knope,"So, they're just going to restore the old one.",2,9
Leslie Knope,"They're changing the title to ""The Diversity Express.""",2,9
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well.",2,9
April Ludgate,Aw.,2,9
Jerry Gergich,Yay!,2,9
Donna Meagle,Ah! Look at that.,2,9
Tom Haverford,It's not as good as the other one.,2,9
Artist,"I don't know what you mean by ""good.""",2,9
Tom Haverford,Neither do I! Just do another one.,2,9
Artist,"You know, I have actual assignments that I have to finish for art school?",2,9
Tom Haverford,Shut up and do more art for me.,2,9
Tom Haverford,This one's racist.,2,9
Tom Haverford,It's beautiful.,2,9
Tom Haverford,I've looked at this for five hours now.,2,9

Councilman Howser,Hello.,2,10
Leslie Knope,Did you get my proposal for the possible rezoning of Lot 48?,2,10
Councilman Howser,I have been busy.,2,10
Leslie Knope,I know.,2,10
Leslie Knope,But I think it would be a really great thing for the neighborhood.,2,10
Councilman Howser,I don't doubt it.,2,10
Councilman Howser,But it's really a question of resource allocation.,2,10
Leslie Knope,And I completely understand that.,2,10
Leslie Knope,"But you and I both know that if we wanna find the money, we can.",2,10
Councilman Howser,I'm running late.,2,10
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'll walk with you.",2,10
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, when we allocate money for parks",2,10
Ron Swanson,Just a reminder.,2,10
Ron Swanson,Tomorrow's a half day.,2,10
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, Mark and I have to conduct the annual trail survey at Slippery Elm Park.",2,10

Ron Swanson,"Nice, Jerry.",2,10
Ron Swanson,"Oh, and if you have any questions about the details, feel free to shoot me an email.",2,10
Leslie Knope,The only trails he's gonna be surveying are trails of lies and deception.,2,10
Leslie Knope,Ron has a special deal with the park rangers.,2,10
Leslie Knope,"Every November, they let him use their cabin so he can go on a secret hunting trip with all the guys in the office.",2,10
Tom Haverford,Not all the guys.,2,10
Tom Haverford,He's never taken me.,2,10
Leslie Knope,"Fine, all the men.",2,10

Leslie Knope,"I want me, Tom and all the other ladies included on your hunting trip.",2,10
Ron Swanson,Hunting trip?,2,10
Ron Swanson,"We're doing a trail survey, Leslie.",2,10
Leslie Knope,You're literally listening to turkey calls.,2,10
Ron Swanson,Is this not rap?,2,10
Leslie Knope,Come on.,2,10
Ron Swanson,All right.,2,10
Ron Swanson,"Look, it's not just a hunting trip, it's a tradition.",2,10
Leslie Knope,I am really good at hunting and I'm even better at being one of the guys.,2,10
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's a work event, so legally I can't stop you from coming.",2,10
Leslie Knope,Yes!,2,10
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so fun!,2,10
Leslie Knope,I'll bring S'mores.,2,10

Leslie Knope,"I'm going hunting tomorrow, so call the State Parks Office and get verbal confirmation that our budget documentation is in.",2,10
Leslie Knope,Can I just tell you the 16 digit tracking number or do you want me to write it down?,2,10
Leslie Knope,I'll write it down.,2,10
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?,2,10
April Ludgate,You want me to dial a number and then read another number out loud?,2,10

Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, how's everything in your life, generally?",2,11
Tom Haverford,Amazing.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Took a risk.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Bought some shoes online.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"Paid off handsomely, as you can see.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Uh-huh.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"And how are your institutions, that you're a part of?",2,11
Tom Haverford,Ah.,2,11
Tom Haverford,You heard about my divorce?,2,11
Leslie Knope,I saw you on the fourth floor.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I'm so, so sorry.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Honestly, it's fine.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and the guy from Sum 41, am I right?",2,11
Leslie Knope,I don't know what those are.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Look, Tom, stop working.",2,11
Tom Haverford,Whoa!,2,11
Tom Haverford,Would have been nice to have saved that.,2,11
Leslie Knope,You should've autosaved that.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Right.,2,11
Leslie Knope,That kind of feels like your fault.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Look, I've heard your voice when she calls you on the phone.",2,11
Leslie Knope,I've seen you look at her ass when she leaves the room.,2,11
Leslie Knope,You love her.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm fine.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Look, look at my face.",2,11
Tom Haverford,Are you watching?,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I did a little research, and divorce is the number two most stressful event in a person's life.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Of course, marriage is number seven.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"So, watch out, everyone.",2,11
Leslie Knope,It's all bad.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"We have to step up, for Tom's sake.",2,11
Ron Swanson,I think Tom seems fine.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is the problem.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Tom always seems like Mr. Slickster Cool Guy, but he's actually hiding his emotions underneath a very thick layer of Axe body spray.",2,11
Leslie Knope,We have to help him.,2,11
Leslie Knope,We are his safe bubble.,2,11
April Ludgate,She's kind of right.,2,11
April Ludgate,"None of his family lives here, and all of his friends are frat guys and morons.",2,11
Ron Swanson,This seems like none of our business.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Be supportive, okay?",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Don't be all, like, ""No, I don't want to.""",2,11
Leslie Knope,"""I am a guy and I like fire and playing hockey and eating meat!""",2,11
Leslie Knope,"""No, no, says I!""",2,11
April Ludgate,That was a really good Ron.,2,11

Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know how to explain--,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Mark.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand still doesn't have that syphilis medication you were asking about.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, hey!",2,11
Andy Dwyer,What a coincidence!,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Are you in this office purely for business reasons?,2,11
Ann Perkins,"Pleasure, actually.",2,11
Ann Perkins,My boyfriend Mark works here.,2,11
Ann Perkins,He's sitting right next to me.,2,11

Andy Dwyer,"Well, I guess I'll see you guys around.",2,11
Ann Perkins,See you.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Oh!,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, also, Mark, again, we don't have those extra small condoms you ordered.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"I called the factory, it's gonna take a special order.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Not just because of the size, but because of the weird shape as well.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,Something they've never dealt with before.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,We'll talk.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Mark never asked me for any small, weirdly shaped condoms.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,I made that up.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Every day, I subtly chip away at their relationship.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Weakening it, little by little.",2,11
Extra,Where's Tom Haverford?,2,11
Tom Haverford,For [bleep] sake.,2,11
Extra,"So, you had a divorce , of course, of course",2,11
Extra,"And no one enjoys a divorce, of course",2,11
Tom Haverford,"I don't know what to do, man.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"I can't be like, ""Hey, Leslie, it's a green card marriage, I'm fine.""",2,11
Ron Swanson,"You know, Leslie just thinks you're a wounded animal, so her female instincts are kicking in.",2,11
Ron Swanson,Here's what you do.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"Act sad, let her pull the thorn out of your paw and wrap a bandage around it.",2,11
Ron Swanson,That'll make her feel better.,2,11
Ron Swanson,She'll get off your jock.,2,11
Tom Haverford,You still can't tell anyone about the green card thing.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Apparently you can get in trouble even after a divorce.,2,11
Ron Swanson,Damn the man.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"Well, hey, your secret's safe with me.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Rondoleezza Rice.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Okay, everyone.",2,11
Tom Haverford,The rumors are true.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Wendy and I are splitting up.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm really hurt.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry you feel that way, little friend.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we go out tonight, hit the town after work, huh?",2,11
Leslie Knope,We'll make it Tom's night.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"You can go anywhere you want, our treat.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I know there's a really fun documentary about tandem bicycles at the art house.",2,11
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be pretty unapologetic.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to a restaurant--,2,11
Tom Haverford,Strip club?,2,11
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?,2,11
Leslie Knope,Noâ¦,2,11
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?,2,11
Leslie Knope,You did.,2,11
Tom Haverford,I definitely heard someone say strip club.,2,11
Leslie Knope,You just did.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Would the Glitter Factory be okay with whoever suggested strip club?,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a good idea, Tom.",2,11
Jerry Gergich,There is a great dinosaur themed restaurant in Patterson.,2,11
Jerry Gergich,It is called Jurassic Fork.,2,11
Jerry Gergich,I have gone there three times a week for the last 15 years.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Ooh!,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Dinosaurs, huh?",2,11
Tom Haverford,All right.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Sounds okay.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Okay!,2,11
Leslie Knope,"It's gonna be a crazy night, guys!",2,11
Leslie Knope,I will see you at Jurassic Fork at 5:45 p.m.,2,11
Jerry Gergich,Yes.,2,11
Waiter,Hi.,2,11
Waiter,"Welcome to Jurassic Fork, where the only thing that'll be extinct is your appetite.",2,11
Waiter,You ready to order?,2,11
Donna Meagle,Yes.,2,11
Donna Meagle,I will have the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Veloci-Wrap.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna get the Tricera-chops, please.",2,11
Waiter,How do you want that cooked?,2,11
Leslie Knope,Medium roar.,2,11
Waiter,Medium rare?,2,11
Leslie Knope,"No, medium roar.",2,11
Waiter,"For legal reasons, we're not allowed to make puns about the temperature of the meats anymore.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"I'll have the surf and turf- asaurus, and a couple of bottles of wine.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna need a lot of wine, so keep it flowing.",2,11
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna be drinking anything.,2,11
Ann Perkins,Just wanted everybody to know that.,2,11
Ann Perkins,I'm not a big fan of group dinners where everybody splits the bill no matter what they get.,2,11
Ann Perkins,"I ordered a Tyranna-Caesar salad, and that's all I'm paying for.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,They got pool.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Mark, you want to play a quick game?",2,11
Andy Dwyer,Finally settle the debate about who's the better pool player?,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"I've never had that debate with anyone, Andy.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, we'll put a little money on it.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,Make it a little more interesting.,2,11
Ann Perkins,"Andy, please.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"No, I just figured because pool is all about angles and he's a failed architect that he might want to play pool.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's do it.,2,11
Ann Perkins,Really?,2,11
Ann Perkins,That worked?,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"How to hustle somebody in pool, by Andy Dwyer.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Step one, find the person you want to hustle.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,Invite them to play pool.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Should they accept, you're in.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Here's what I think we should do.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Everyone should go around and say one thing that they love about Tom.,2,11
Jerry Gergich,I'll start.,2,11
Jerry Gergich,I really wish I could have your body.,2,11
Tom Haverford,What?,2,11
April Ludgate,Ew!,2,11
April Ludgate,"Like, tied up, naked, in your basement?",2,11
Jerry Gergich,"No, no.",2,11
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, you're in good shape and you can eat whatever you want.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was weird, Jerry.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go ahead.",2,11
Ann Perkins,I think Tom is really nice.,2,11
Ann Perkins,"Also, if you guys want to give me your credit cards, I'll just divide it up myself, I don't mind.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!",2,11
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.,2,11
Leslie Knope,The restaurant will just divide it evenly.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Just enjoy yourself.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"April, go ahead.",2,11
April Ludgate,Tom is the only cool person in the office.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Ridiculous.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Donna?,2,11
Donna Meagle,"I love you, Tom.",2,11
Donna Meagle,You're my little prince.,2,11
Donna Meagle,I just want to put you in a little cape and a little hat and just fly you around.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"Thank you, Donna.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Hey, garcon.",2,11
Tom Haverford,I'm still feeling pretty sad.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Can I get two creme brulees and another glass of bronto grigio?,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Why would he do that?,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,And that's game.,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,I think you now owe me 25 dollars.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Shoot.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Someone had a pool table growing up, huh?",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, no, no.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,What do you say we play again?,2,11
Andy Dwyer,We'll make it a little more interesting.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Go double or nothing?,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,Why not?,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Step two.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Lose to your opponent intentionally so they gain confidence.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Step two has been completed easily.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Very easily.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Mark is pretty good at pool.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"So, how are you feeling, Tom?",2,11
Ron Swanson,Are you feeling okay?,2,11
Tom Haverford,I like pretending to be sad.,2,11
Tom Haverford,I now see why girls do it.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"So, your arrangement with Wendy, it really was completely platonic?",2,11
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"Never so much as even kissed, except for a little peck at the wedding ceremony for appearances.",2,11
Ron Swanson,"Uh, now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy.",2,11
Ron Swanson,"Would it be okay with you if I was to ask her out, once the fake dust settles?",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, why not?",2,11
Tom Haverford,Sure.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.",2,11
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna take a leak.,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh!,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"That would be 6,400 dollars.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,I accept checks and most major credit cards.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Mark is way better than me.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna... I'm gonna say that there is at least a chance that I didn't think this through completely.,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"I think I'm done, Andy.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,Okay.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,Forget money.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,We'll play for something else.,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,You have nothing else to give me.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,I have a T-shirt I tackled Eddie Vedder in.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,It's literally priceless.,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, how about this?",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, you don't owe me any money, but if I win, you have to stop bugging me and Ann.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,What are you talking about?,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"No more comments, no more showing up when we're hanging out together.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to leave us alone.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"That doesn't seem like a very fair bet, Mark.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"So, if I win, I also get Ann.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, fine.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, then you get Ann.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,Rack them up!,2,11
April Ludgate,Somebody punch someone!,2,11
Leslie Knope,"So, how you doing, buddy?",2,11
Leslie Knope,Want some steak?,2,11
Leslie Knope,Champagne?,2,11
Leslie Knope,Think of something extravagant and we'll get it for you.,2,11
Leslie Knope,What do you want?,2,11
Leslie Knope,A cheese fountain?,2,11
Leslie Knope,A ruby?,2,11
Leslie Knope,A goose heart?,2,11
Tom Haverford,How about a marriage?,2,11
Tom Haverford,How about a non-divorce?,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'm sorry.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, think about it.",2,11
Tom Haverford,Does our marriage really make sense to you?,2,11
Tom Haverford,"She's a tall, beautiful surgeon.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"I'm a short, beautiful government employee slash club promoter.",2,11
Leslie Knope,You're a club promoter?,2,11
Tom Haverford,Aspiring.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"The point is, I never meant anything to her.",2,11
Tom Haverford,It wasn't even a real marriage.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a T-Rex.",2,11
Leslie Knope,I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, crap.",2,11
Leslie Knope,We are going to the Glitter Factory.,2,11
Tom Haverford,What?,2,11
Donna Meagle,Not me.,2,11
Donna Meagle,I can't go back there.,2,11
Donna Meagle,"But if you see Jasmine, tell her she can keep Anthony, but I want my microwave back.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good.",2,11
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take April home.,2,11
April Ludgate,"No, I want to go to the Glitter Factory.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, drop out of school and start doing meth.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, everybody.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but once you go in there, you will see things you cannot unsee.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"I'm a feminist, okay?",2,11
Leslie Knope,"I would never, ever go to a strip club.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be ""Equality.""",2,11
Leslie Knope,But I'm willing to sacrifice all that I've worked for just to put a smile on your perverted little face.,2,11
Leslie Knope,So don't blow this.,2,11
Tom Haverford,All right.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Okay!,2,11
Leslie Knope,Lap dances are on me.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm paying for them.",2,11
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna actually be on me.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Got it.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like Jane Goodall studying the chimps, you know?",2,11
Leslie Knope,'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.,2,11
Tom Haverford,There is a girl here that also works at Quiznos.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I'm gonna put these in places you've never heard of.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I've been a little down.",2,11
Tom Haverford,Totally natural.,2,11
Tom Haverford,I'm getting divorced.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"But now, I'm ready to pull myself up by some g-strings.",2,11
Leslie Knope,God!,2,11
Leslie Knope,It is rough in here.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Is it always like this?,2,11
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't know.,2,11
Ron Swanson,Don't like strip clubs.,2,11
Ron Swanson,Smells like a wet mop in here.,2,11
Ron Swanson,And I get the feeling that every one of these women is running a low-grade fever.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"You're one of the good ones, Ron.",2,11
Ron Swanson,Wait a minute.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"Hello, beautiful.",2,11
Ron Swanson,Strippers do nothing for me.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"I like a strong, salt of the earth, self-possessed woman at the top of her field.",2,11
Ron Swanson,"Your Steffi Grafs, your Sheryl Swoopeses.",2,11
Ron Swanson,"But I will take a free breakfast buffet any time, any place.",2,11
Ron Swanson,"Tom cat, pull up a mouth.",2,11
Ron Swanson,This buffet is unstoppable.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm not hungry.",2,11
Ron Swanson,"By the way, you're doing a bang-up job of looking sad about Wendy.",2,11
Ron Swanson,Does she make scrambled eggs?,2,11
Tom Haverford,No.,2,11
Ron Swanson,Take it down a notch.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio.",2,11
Announcer,Coming on stage next is Angel.,2,11
Announcer,Angel!,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, in case I don't sink this, it's been a real pleasure dating you.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,Scratch on the eight!,2,11
Andy Dwyer,I'm victorious.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,I am awesome at pool and I hustled your ass.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, take a moment to say goodbye.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know how to say this.,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,"I am so sorry, and I will do my best to visit you on holidays.",2,11
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, you tried.",2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,I guess you're his now.,2,11
Ann Perkins,Do you want to get out of here?,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,I do.,2,11
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,2,11
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Andy.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,"I know that, legally, Ann is now mine, but it weirdly doesn't feel that way.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"All right, Tom!",2,11
Leslie Knope,This is Seabiscuit.,2,11
Sierra,Sierra.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Sierra.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,11
Leslie Knope,It's loud in here.,2,11
Leslie Knope,And I gave her money to writhe around on your parts.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I don't want to do that.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, I already paid her.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Can I get my money back?,2,11
Sierra,No.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let her do her writhing.",2,11
Tom Haverford,All right.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I just gotta say, Sierra.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"But go crazy, okay?",2,11
Leslie Knope,Give my friend here the works.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Really grind the sorrow out of him.,2,11
Sierra,You got it.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"And then, afterwards, maybe reconsider your profession, but for now, grind away.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Whoo!,2,11
Leslie Knope,Stripper dancing action!,2,11
Tom Haverford,This isn't working.,2,11
Tom Haverford,I don't want to do this.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Is it because you have a strong, positive female figure watching you?",2,11
Tom Haverford,No.,2,11
Tom Haverford,It's because I'm miserable.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Never mind.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Seabiscuit.",2,11
Leslie Knope,That'll be all.,2,11
Announcer,"All Glitter Factory girls, please come backstage.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Tom.,2,11
Tom Haverford,I don't know what's wrong with me.,2,11
Tom Haverford,This is honestly the saddest I've ever been.,2,11
Announcer,Glitter Bomb! Ah!,2,11
Tom Haverford,I've been to the Glitter Factory a million times.,2,11
Tom Haverford,"That girl up there, she's my emergency contact.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"But right now, I hate it here, and I just want to see Wendy.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's perfectly normal to feel devastated when something's over.",2,11
Leslie Knope,It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Sixty days.,2,11
Tom Haverford,And then she's free to marry Ron Swanson.,2,11
Leslie Knope,What? Ron?,2,11
Tom Haverford,He's gonna ask her out.,2,11
Tom Haverford,He told me.,2,11
Tom Haverford,But who cares?,2,11
Tom Haverford,"If it's not him, it'll just be some other guy.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Swanson! Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy?,2,11
Ron Swanson,It's complicated.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"What is wrong with you? I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy.",2,11
Leslie Knope,I don't get men.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives.",2,11
Leslie Knope,It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Tom.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Great!,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Good, okay.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Could you carry him out of here, please? And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife?",2,11
Leslie Knope,Thanks.,2,11
Leslie Knope,From the knees.,2,11
Ron Swanson,He weighs eight pounds.,2,11
Wendy,Oh! Oh.,2,11
Wendy,"Oh, boy.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Wendy.",2,11
Leslie Knope,"We took Tom out tonight, and he had a little bit too much to drink.",2,11
Wendy,Oh!,2,11
Wendy,Okay.,2,11
Wendy,Come on in.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",2,11
Leslie Knope,You insensitive little hussy.,2,11
Wendy,Excuse me?,2,11
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, whoa.",2,11
Ron Swanson,Halt.,2,11
Leslie Knope,You're not even divorced yet and you're inviting other men over?,2,11
Extra,You're married?,2,11
Wendy,Uh... Technically.,2,11
Wendy,"Yeah, that's... That's my husband.",2,11
Extra,Who's he carrying?,2,11
Wendy,No.,2,11
Wendy,"No, that's his... That's his boss.",2,11
Wendy,My husband's the one that's being carried by his boss.,2,11
Ron Swanson,How's it going?,2,11
Extra,Good.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Wendy? You and Ron will be perfect for each other.",2,11
Leslie Knope,You two should get married and start a club for people who betray Tom Haverford.,2,11
Leslie Knope,You have a lovely home.,2,11
Ron Swanson,"So, where do you want this?",2,11
Leslie Knope,"So, how you feeling? Rough morning?",2,11
Tom Haverford,You know those hangover pills you can order on TV?,2,11
Tom Haverford,I threw up a bunch of them this morning.,2,11
Tom Haverford,I feel much better.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"I know last night was really rough, but all I want for you is to be able to get over this.",2,11
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I need to tell you something.",2,11
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,11
Tom Haverford,The reason I was acting weird yesterday was Wendy and I have a green card marriage.,2,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, because you're a Libyan!",2,11
Tom Haverford,No.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Damn it.,2,11
Tom Haverford,Wendy's from Canada.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Oh! Oh.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Wait.,2,11
Leslie Knope,Start again.,2,11
Mark Brendanawicz,This--,2,11
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ann.",2,11
Andy Dwyer,Mark.,2,11
Andy Dwyer,You guys got a second? It's about last night.,2,11
Ann Perkins,I hope I'm not gonna have to explain to you that you don't actually own me.,2,11

Leslie Knope,"Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread.",2,13
Chris,I don't know.,2,13
Chris,I'd have to do an MRI.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Look.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Thisâ¦ it's just bread in there.,2,13
Chris,"Yeah, but what's inside that bread? Could be cheese.",2,13
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, it's good that you found your calling.",2,13
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've never even had an MRI before.",2,13
Chris,What?,2,13
Leslie Knope,I don't know about this.,2,13
Chris,"Well, I'm offering you a free scan.",2,13
Chris,"It usually costs up to 2,000 dollars.",2,13
Chris,I'm kind of spoiling you here.,2,13
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am a little curious.",2,13
Chris,Good.,2,13
Chris,"Frankly, I don't want to invest in someone who only has three months to live.",2,13
Leslie Knope,Oh.,2,13
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?",2,13
Leslie Knope,Maybe someday we'll tell our grandkids how weird our first date was and how creepy their grandfather was.,2,13
Chris,Try not to smile too much. It'll affect the diagnosis.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Well hopefully there'll be nothing to diagnose.,2,13
Chris,"Sometimes smiling is read as ""AIDS.""",2,13
Chris,"Oh, you're not on your period, are you?",2,13
Leslie Knope,No.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Does that matter?,2,13
Chris,"Well, not for this.",2,13
Chris,Okay.,2,13
Chris,It's gonna be a little crammed in there.,2,13
Chris,"Don't worry, I'll be right on the other side of that glass.",2,13

Tom Haverford,"I get her number, it's two days later, what do I text her?",2,13
Zack,"""It was nice meeting you.""",2,13
Tom Haverford,"No, Zack!",2,13
Tom Haverford,"I don't text her, ""It was nice meeting you.""",2,13
Tom Haverford,"I wait eight weeks and I text her, ""What's cracking?""",2,13
Tom Haverford,"Your resume's very impressive, but tell me about you.",2,13
Tom Haverford,Tell me about your friends.,2,13
Tom Haverford,Be as superficial as possible.,2,13
Tom Haverford,Just your basic assistant stuff.,2,13
Tom Haverford,"Taking messages, wakeup calls, Muscle Milk runs, condom runs, bottle service at the Snakehole Lounge, covering for me in any legally dicey situations.",2,13
Extra,Sorry.,2,13
Extra,What do I get out of this?,2,13
Tom Haverford,Connections.,2,13
Tom Haverford,"Plus 19 grand a year, minus my 10% headhunters' fee.",2,13
Extra,I have to pay you two grand if I get hired?,2,13
Tom Haverford,I have a job to offer.,2,13
Tom Haverford,"In the immortal words of Rod Blagojevich, ""It's a [bleep] valuable thing.""",2,13

Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,13
Chris,So you never told me where you're from.,2,13
Leslie Knope,I'm from Pawnee.,2,13
Chris,"Keep still, please.",2,13
Chris,"And you said that your mom works in government, too, is that right?",2,13
Leslie Knope,Yes she does.,2,13
Chris,"You gotta keep still. No talking, Leslie.",2,13
Chris,What kind of music do you like?,2,13
Leslie Knope,Can I answer that?,2,13
Chris,Sure.,2,13
Chris,Keep still.,2,13
Leslie Knope,All kinds.,2,13
Chris,"Very important that you keep still at this moment, Leslie.",2,13
Chris,I've told you that a thousand times.,2,13
Chris,Did you ever break your arm?,2,13
Chris,You can answer that.,2,13
Chris,"Here, I'll turn it off.",2,13
Leslie Knope,"One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control.",2,13
Leslie Knope,I'm surprised you can see that.,2,13
Leslie Knope,"It was, like, three years ago.",2,13
Chris,I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.,2,13
Chris,"You never had any kids, right, Leslie?",2,13
Leslie Knope,No.,2,13
Chris,You've got a great oven.,2,13
Leslie Knope,"Okay, time to go.",2,13
Chris,You got ample room in there.,2,13
Chris,"Honestly, if you wanted to, you could go triplets right off the bat, Leslie.",2,13
Chris,"You got a big, industrial-sized oven.",2,13
Leslie Knope,"So we're done, right?",2,13
Ann Perkins,Sorry.,2,13
Ann Perkins,Hey!,2,13
Ann Perkins,How's the date going?,2,13
Leslie Knope,Good!,2,13
Leslie Knope,We just finished the MRI.,2,13
Ann Perkins,What?,2,13
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts.",2,13
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to offend you, you know? I know he's your friend.",2,13
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not offended at all. I don't know him that well.",2,13
Leslie Knope,Why would you think he'd be perfect for me then?,2,13
Ann Perkins,"Well, he seemed great.",2,13
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Les.",2,13
Ann Perkins,"I'll find you somebody else, okay?",2,13
Ann Perkins,Just don't let this sour you on dating.,2,13
Ann Perkins,"Like, what you're doing is really healthy, so keep the faith, okay?",2,13
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay.",2,13
Chris,Hey!,2,13
Chris,No cell phones!,2,13
Chris,Don't touch that.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,13
Chris,Just take your hands off it.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,What was that about?,2,13
Ann Perkins,I set Leslie up on a date.,2,13
Ann Perkins,I don't think it's going that well.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, no.",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,With Justin?,2,13
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no.",2,13
Ann Perkins,This guy I know from the hospital.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Why wouldn't you set her up with Justin?,2,13
Ann Perkins,I don't really see them together.,2,13
Ann Perkins,You know?,2,13
Ann Perkins,"Plus, Leslie just got out of a relationship, so I didn't want Justin to be, like, her rebound guy or anything, you know?",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, that makes sense.",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.,2,13
Ann Perkins,Why are we talking about this?,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,We're not.,2,13
Leslie Knope,What do you see?,2,13
Chris,Well it actually all looks pretty good.,2,13
Chris,You've got a large brain.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,2,13
Chris,Yeah.,2,13
Chris,"Well, it looks pretty... Hang on.",2,13
Chris,That's weird.,2,13
Leslie Knope,What?,2,13
Leslie Knope,What's weird?,2,13
Chris,Your brain.,2,13
Chris,See that shadow right there?,2,13
Chris,"Oh, my God!",2,13
Leslie Knope,What?,2,13
Leslie Knope,Is that bad?,2,13
Chris,I don't know.,2,13
Chris,I'd have a doctor look at that immediately if I were you.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?,2,13
Chris,"Oh, wait.",2,13
Chris,Oh.,2,13
Chris,"It's, like, a smudge or something.",2,13
Chris,We almost wheeled you out of here on a chair.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Should we go?,2,13
Chris,"Yeah, we should go.",2,13
Chris,Can you imagine if you had to spend the rest of your life sipping a steak through a straw?,2,13
Chris,That almost happened to you. You were a smudge away.,2,13
Chris,Thank God I was here.,2,13
Chris,Looks like we make a pretty good team.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sorry, but there's just something weird about the way you talk about him.",2,13
Ann Perkins,I don't know.,2,13
Ann Perkins,There was definitely times when we thought maybe we would go out someday.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,That's why you didn't set Leslie up.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Because you're saving him.,2,13
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not.",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah, you are.",2,13
Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine.",2,13
Ann Perkins,"You don't have someone in your life that you think, ""I don't know, maybe if things were different, maybe, some day...""",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"If I'm late for dinner one night, you're gonna dump me for Dustin?",2,13
Ann Perkins,"No, no. Justin.",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Justin?,2,13
Ann Perkins,"Absolutely not, but if we break up or you die tragically in a city planning accident and I wait a respectful amount of time, I don't know. Maybeâ¦",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,You can't save somebody for the future while you're in a relationship.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Even I know that.,2,13
Chris,"So, did you want to go back to your place?",2,13
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date.",2,13
Chris,I get it.,2,13
Chris,"Get your MRI and get out, huh?",2,13
Leslie Knope,This was your idea.,2,13
Chris,Clever lady.,2,13
Chris,I guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.,2,13
Chris,I should have noticed that you're missing a heart.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Ew.,2,13
Chris,"Goodbye, Leslie.",2,13
Leslie Knope,Right.,2,13
Leslie Knope,I drove us here.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Goodie.,2,13
Chris,"Hey, do you mind if we pick up my son Nate at his basketball game on the way back?",2,13
Tom Haverford,"So, how was the big date?",2,13
Leslie Knope,"Well, the good news is I don't have cancer.",2,13
Leslie Knope,The bad news is I got an MRI bill for 2000 dollars.,2,13
Tom Haverford,That sounds hot.,2,13
Leslie Knope,I just don't understand why the hell Ann thought we'd be a good fit.,2,13
Tom Haverford,"Oh, you slept together?",2,13
Leslie Knope,"What? Not sexually. God, what's wrong with you, Tom?",2,13
Justin,This a bad time?,2,13
Leslie Knope,"No, come on in.",2,13
Tom Haverford,Justin!,2,13
Justin,"What's up, brother?",2,13
Leslie Knope,Should weâ¦?,2,13
Justin,"Yeah, let's do.",2,13
Tom Haverford,See you dude.,2,13
Justin,"See you around, brother.",2,13
Tom Haverford,Dope pea coat.,2,13
Tom Haverford,I have the same one in an extra small.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?",2,13
Andy Dwyer,"Well, well, well. Look who's bothering who now?",2,13
Andy Dwyer,Seems like the shot is on the other foot.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,And the guuy who polishes shoes is now me.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,What up? What can I do for ya?,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"When you were dating Ann, did you know this guy Justin?",2,13
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Justin?",2,13
Andy Dwyer,I hate Justin.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,Ann was so obviously into him.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,It was so annoying.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,"I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with, Justin's up here, I'm up here, and then you're down here.",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy, so, naturally, I came to you for reassurance.",2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Do me a favor.,2,13
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't tell Ann that we talked about this.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,Will do.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,Ann Perkins! You should be ashamed of yourself.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,What you're doing to Mark is not cool.,2,13
Ann Perkins,Why are you guys talking to each other? You know what? Forget it.,2,13
Ann Perkins,I'm not getting into this with you.,2,13
April Ludgate,You did something wrong?,2,13
Ann Perkins,No! I didn't do anything wrong.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,13
Ann Perkins,Come here.,2,13
Ann Perkins,This is none of your business.,2,13
Ann Perkins,You don't know what you're talking about.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,"Actually, I do know what I'm talking about.",2,13
Andy Dwyer,"Every time I used to sit around all afternoon playing video games wearing only my slippers, all of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself, and do you know why?",2,13
Ann Perkins,Didn't you just explain why?,2,13
Andy Dwyer,I would feel bad about myself because I would start to think about this perfect guy.,2,13
Andy Dwyer,"Anytime you would talk about Justin, I didn't feel very important.",2,13
Andy Dwyer,That was rough.,2,13
Ann Perkins,"Well, I didn't know that.",2,13
Andy Dwyer,"Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left.",2,13
Andy Dwyer,"But you do know now, so you have to choose.",2,13
Andy Dwyer,It's either me or Justin.,2,13
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna choose.,2,13
Ann Perkins,Wait.,2,13
Ann Perkins,I'm dating Mark!,2,13
Andy Dwyer,"Are you, though?",2,13
Ann Perkins,Yes!,2,13

Justin,I drop the F bomb.,2,13
Leslie Knope,"""Frivolous.""",2,13
Leslie Knope,Excellent.,2,13

Leslie Knope,"Well, Justin, I just... I can't thank you enough.",2,13
Justin,It's my pleasure.,2,13
Justin,Maybe I'll see you around sometime.,2,13
Leslie Knope,Yeah!,2,13

Donna Meagle,Maybe she's got him on hold.,2,13
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?,2,13

Andy Dwyer,Isn't it awesome?,2,14
Andy Dwyer,"He got it in Cambodia, when he was hiking Mount Everest.",2,14
April Ludgate,Let's put chewed up gum in his pockets.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,That's genius.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,But I can't.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie's being super cool to me, and I can't screw over her boyfriend's jacket.",2,14
April Ludgate,I'll do it when you're not in the room then.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,That would be terrible.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,I'm being sarcastic.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,That would be awesome.,2,14
Justin,"God, India is so amazing.",2,14
Justin,Let me tell you something.,2,14
Justin,That is my absolute favorite place to travel.,2,14
Justin,Where did you say your parents were from?,2,14
Tom Haverford,The south part.,2,14

Justin,"Have you ever been to the Kaniman Mosque, down in Tamil Nadu?",2,14

Tom Haverford,My uncle practically runs the place.,2,14
Tom Haverford,I've prayed there.,2,14
Tom Haverford,It's sick.,2,14
Justin,"Tell me everything, right now.",2,14
Tom Haverford,"One sec, I just got to hit the loo, as those bastard British lmperialists would say.",2,14

Ann Perkins,Justin is over there talking to Mark.,2,14
Ann Perkins,Happily.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good.",2,14
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna casually make my--,2,14
Mark Brendanawicz,"So my face is literally on fire, but it's this weird chemical, so no one can see the flames.",2,14
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm dancing around, freaking out.",2,14
Mark Brendanawicz,I end up having to dunk my face into a bucket of sand.,2,14
Justin,Unreal!,2,14
Leslie Knope,Unreal!,2,14
Justin,"Oh, my God, that is unbelievable.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's... Isn't it, Ann?",2,14
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.,2,14
Mark Brendanawicz,Didn't happen to me.,2,14
Mark Brendanawicz,It was a kid I knew from camp.,2,14
Mark Brendanawicz,But a great story's a great story.,2,14
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, plus, the kid can't tell it, his mouth melted.",2,14
Leslie Knope,Dinner is served!,2,14

Leslie Knope,Excellent!,2,14
Wendy,Hey.,2,14
Wendy,I'm sorry.,2,14
Wendy,Are we late?,2,14
Tom Haverford,What the hell are you doing?,2,14
Tom Haverford,How could you invite Wendy when Ron's here?,2,14
Tom Haverford,He's gonna wrap her up in his moustache and take her home.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"We agreed that we should invite interesting people for Justin, and Wendy is an interesting person!",2,14
Leslie Knope,I've been telling you for weeks that you should tell her how you feel.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Now's your chance!,2,14
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah.",2,14
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.,2,14
Tom Haverford,"No, it doesn't!",2,14
Tom Haverford,"Not cool, at all!",2,14

Tom Haverford,"No, I won't.",2,14
Tania,The first course is a Mexican bean soup.,2,14
Ron Swanson,Are these peppers for consuming?,2,14
Tania,I wouldn't.,2,14
Tania,They're very hot.,2,14
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna give it a try.,2,14
Ron Swanson,Hot.,2,14
Wendy,You're very brave.,2,14
Tom Haverford,"Please, that was one of the tiny ones.",2,14
Tom Haverford,This is how you eat it!,2,14
Ron Swanson,"Don't do that, Tom!",2,14
Tom Haverford,"Mm, [bleep].",2,14
Leslie Knope,"This is something, Justin.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"Derek and Ben are gay, but often, on occasion, April will have relations with Derek.",2,14
Leslie Knope,Right?,2,14
Leslie Knope,Crazy stuff.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Discuss that.,2,14
April Ludgate,There's not much more to discuss.,2,14
April Ludgate,You kind of explained it all.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Who else is gay?,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need your help.",2,14
Leslie Knope,There was a lull.,2,14
Leslie Knope,I saw Justin yawn.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Please tell me that yawning is a sign of excitement in India or something.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Tom, focus!",2,14
Leslie Knope,"God, you're no help.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to be clear, this will in no way influence me.",2,14
Leslie Knope,It won't affect my decision.,2,14
Leslie Knope,And it has no bearing on the future of your class.,2,14
Ron Swanson,"Hey, little buddy!",2,14
Ron Swanson,Everything okay?,2,14
Ron Swanson,That took a long time.,2,14
Wendy,Poor Tommy.,2,14
Wendy,He has a very frail colon.,2,14
Justin,"I feel your pain, brother.",2,14
Justin,The hottest thing I ever put into my mouth was in this remote village in Southern Brazil.,2,14
Leslie Knope,This sounds good.,2,14
Justin,Yeah.,2,14
Justin,They take a little bit of scorpion poison and they serve--,2,14
Leslie Knope,I wonder who that is.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Who could that be?,2,14
Justin,More people?,2,14
Leslie Knope,A belly dancer?,2,14
Leslie Knope,What?,2,14
Leslie Knope,"It's weird, but she just showed up.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not the kind of person that's gonna throw someone out, or, you know, not let them in if they randomly show up.",2,14
Leslie Knope,I don't know how they all got here.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"You know, people hear about a killer party at Knope's house, they all come running.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"You don't do origami every day, do ya?",2,14
Andy Dwyer,"They brought in a little entertainment, thank God.",2,14
Andy Dwyer,"That Justin, he's so boring.",2,14
Ben,What are you talking about? He's incredible.,2,14
Derek,Yeah.,2,14
Derek,"He's not gay, but if he were, I would totally break up with Ben for him.",2,14
Ben,"Yeah, I would understand.",2,14
Ben,"He's amazing, right, April?",2,14
Andy Dwyer,"Right, April? Don't we love him?",2,14
April Ludgate,Yeah.,2,14
April Ludgate,He's actually kind of awesome.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,You're underage.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,"I could lose my liquor license, I'm sorry.",2,14
April Ludgate,Andy.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Hey.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Are you having fun?,2,14
Justin,"All I can say is, this is not what I was expecting.",2,14
Justin,I cannot believe there's more.,2,14
Leslie Knope,There's not.,2,14
Barney,"Miss Knope, I understand that you're currently evaluating the rec center teachers.",2,14
Ron Swanson,"You're doing what, Leslie?",2,14
Barney,I demand an evaluation.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,14
Leslie Knope,What course do you teach?,2,14
Barney,"When it comes to choosing accounting software, there's no accounting for taste.",2,14
Barney,The advantage of QuickBooks Pro is that it's easy to assemble a list of vendors--,2,14
Ron Swanson,"Well, this is great.",2,14
Ron Swanson,"I'm heading home, so as not to have to be here anymore.",2,14
Ron Swanson,"My office, first thing tomorrow.",2,14
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I think we're probably gonna take off, too.",2,14
Barney,The demonstration takes another 45 minutes.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, guys, please.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, can you just stay? Okay? Justin, would you--",2,14
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",2,14
Phil,"I promise you, Miss Knope, this disciplinary committee will go over every detail of what happened last night.",2,14
Phil,And we will determine whether you are guilty of abusing your power.,2,14
Phil,Do you have anything to say before we begin?,2,14
Leslie Knope,Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out.,2,14
Tom Haverford,I would like to say that Leslie is incapable of using people for her own gain.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Tom.",2,14
Tom Haverford,"But I can't, because Leslie loves using people for her own gain.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Phil, I'd like to say something to Tom on the record.",2,14
Phil,This has all been on the record.,2,14
Leslie Knope,I'm very sorry that I invited Wendy to the party.,2,14
Phil,Is Wendy one of the teachers?,2,14
Tom Haverford,"No, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife.",2,14
Leslie Knope,And hopefully then-to-be future wife.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm really sorry.",2,14
Leslie Knope,I put a new romance in front of an old friendship.,2,14
Tom Haverford,Okay.,2,14
Leslie Knope,I put a beautiful man in front of an adorable man child.,2,14
Tom Haverford,You're ruining it.,2,14
Leslie Knope,I put a big white stallion in front of a little brown pony.,2,14
Tom Haverford,Totally uncalled for.,2,14
Phil,Ron Swanson will be next.,2,14
Ron Swanson,"When it comes to government hearings, the only type of witness I enjoy being is a hostile one.",2,14
Ron Swanson,That's why I intend to answer every one of their questions with a question.,2,14
Phil,Were you aware that all of the entertainment and food was provided by rec center teachers?,2,14
Ron Swanson,Would I have stayed if I knew that?,2,14
Phil,"I don't know, would you have?",2,14
Ron Swanson,Would you have?,2,14
Phil,No.,2,14
Phil,I wouldn't have.,2,14
Phil,Did you hear Leslie make any promises?,2,14
Ron Swanson,What constitutes a promise?,2,14
Phil,A quid pro quo.,2,14
Ron Swanson,Oh! Do you know Latin?,2,14
Phil,Okay.,2,14
Phil,"Thank you, Ron.",2,14
Ron Swanson,Are we done?,2,14
April Ludgate,Can I get a shine?,2,14
Andy Dwyer,Oh. No.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,"We're closed, due to betrayment.",2,14
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry.",2,14
April Ludgate,But I don't know what you're talking about.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you ask your new best friend, whose name is Justin.",2,14
April Ludgate,Justin?,2,14
Andy Dwyer,Yes.,2,14
April Ludgate,I would.,2,14
April Ludgate,But he's probably too busy cleaning gum out of his coat pockets.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,Wow.,2,14
Andy Dwyer,Unbetrayed.,2,14
Phil,"So, you don't work for the government and you had no idea that these people were teachers from the local rec center?",2,14
Justin,No.,2,14
Phil,I was simply attending a dinner party at my friend's house.,2,14
Phil,"Why is he here, Miss Knope?",2,14
Leslie Knope,That will become clear.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Anderson, could you please describe that evening?",2,14
Justin,"Well, I had a very pleasant time.",2,14
Justin,"And from my perspective, there was no abuse of power with respect to Miss Knope and any of her various guests.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"Could you define pleasant? Did you have a good time? Did you have a great time? Be specific, and do remember that you're under oath.",2,14
Justin,I had an amazing time.,2,14
Leslie Knope,But you fell asleep.,2,14
Justin,"Oh, God.",2,14
Justin,I'm so sorry.,2,14
Justin,"You know, look, I'd been given a case the night before, so I had to stay up all night working on it and I didn't want to cancel.",2,14
Leslie Knope,You should've told me.,2,14
Leslie Knope,I would've rescheduled.,2,14
Justin,Are you kidding me? I was looking forward to it.,2,14
Justin,I had an awesome time which had nothing to do with the rec center teachers.,2,14
Leslie Knope,No further questions.,2,14
Phil,Okay.,2,14
Phil,"We're going to take a break, and we'll let you know what we decide in about an hour.",2,14
Justin,Great.,2,14
Justin,I will see you later.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of official business, so I can't talk about it right now.",2,14
Justin,Okay.,2,14
Leslie Knope,"But, yes, yes, you will.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"So, did you get that? He said amazing and awesome.",2,14
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna drive up and see him next weekend.",2,14
Leslie Knope,There's some Kabuki theater festival happening.,2,14
Ann Perkins,Great.,2,14
Ann Perkins,You're so relaxed.,2,14
Ann Perkins,You're not freaking out about this at all?,2,14
Phil,"Okay, Leslie.",2,14
Phil,We've reached our decision.,2,14
Phil,We're not going to take any further action at this time.,2,14
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,2,14
Phil,It really helped that you asked for this hearing yourself.,2,14
Phil,And that you made financial restitution out of your own pocket.,2,14
Phil,But I think we both know you skirted a line here.,2,14
Ann Perkins,You turned yourself in? Why?,2,14
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did something wrong, and I felt bad.",2,14

Andy Dwyer,"I mean, here's the thing, though.",2,16
Andy Dwyer,Who is that?,2,16
Andy Dwyer,My problem is I don't know how to tell if we're doing good.,2,16
Andy Dwyer,"Because when you play a rock show, it's really easy to know if you're doing great because chicks will flash their boobs at you when you're up onstage.",2,16

Mark Brendanawicz,"No, I'm sort of serious.",2,16
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, fine, forget it.",2,16

April Ludgate,I kind of feel like it would have been good for you to have your own place.,2,17

Evelyn Rowshlind,Let's be honest.,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,Animal Control is not the most effective branch of our government.,2,18

Andy Dwyer,I need it.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,I got a really bad case of shoeshine head today.,2,18
April Ludgate,"Andy recently diagnosed himself with what he calls ""shoeshine head.""",2,18

Ron Swanson,It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car.,2,18
Ron Swanson,Are you gonna tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,There is a basket of oil soaked rags above a wood burning stove.,2,18

Mark Brendanawicz,This says it should be recharged June of 1996.,2,18

Leslie Knope,"You're next, Poopy.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Very impressive, Leslie.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you.",2,18
Leslie Knope,I had a great task force.,2,18
Leslie Knope,I was just the simple mastermind who planned the whole operation and executed it to perfection.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"This is Andy Dwyer, he actually caught the thing.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,Mr. Dwyer.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"Please, my friends call me Andy Radical.",2,18
Tom Haverford,"No, we don't.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"By day, Andy Dwyer, shoeshineist.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"By a different time of day, Andy Radical, possum tackler.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"And by night, I do whatever I want.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,No job.,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,We think that this is a great PR opportunity.,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"So, we've arranged for a reporter from the Journal to stop by to interview, get some pictures of the team.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Task force.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Great!,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"And next time you need a special favor from the mayor's office, give me a call.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I will!",2,18
Leslie Knope,I need so many special favors.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Which one should I choose?,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, you don't have to choose right--",2,18
Leslie Knope,How about an extra recycling can?,2,18
Leslie Knope,No.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Laminated bus pass?,2,18
Leslie Knope,No.,2,18
Leslie Knope,What time do you usually go to sleep?,2,18
Leslie Knope,Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Let's stick to business hours, shall we?",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"See you in hell, buddy.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?,2,18
Leslie Knope,Yes.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Am I quite sure?,2,18
Leslie Knope,No.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Am I sure enough?,2,18
Leslie Knope,Maybe.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?",2,18
Leslie Knope,Of course.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Could I live with myself?,2,18
Leslie Knope,That depends.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Does doing so help me make decisions?,2,18
Leslie Knope,Uhâ¦,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Shauna.",2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, Leslie.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Hi!,2,18
Leslie Knope,Andy.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"You remember Shauna Malwee-Tweep, from the Pawnee Journal?",2,18
Andy Dwyer,How could I forget?,2,18
Andy Dwyer,You wrote the article when I fell in the pit.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"And then afterwards, had sex with Mark and everyone talked about it.",2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, you're on the golf course, and you see Fairway Frank.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"Let me explain something to you, Tweep.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"When you're in a situation, you don't have time to think.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"So, I thought to myself, ""Don't think, Andy, act.""",2,18
Tom Haverford,"So, you weren't thinking?",2,18
Andy Dwyer,Not at all.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.,2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Were you scared?,2,18
Andy Dwyer,No.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"No, I wasn't.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I I lived in the pit for the better part of last year, and made some vermin friends.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,You know what?,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"""Friends"" sounds stupid.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,Colleagues.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"They are bad at sharing, but they are good at tag.",2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, your family must be very proud.",2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What does your girlfriend think?,2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The nurse.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,I broke up with Ann.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,Shortly after she kicked me out and told me we wouldn't be together anymore.,2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, maybe this article will change her mind.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,What now?,2,18
Andy Dwyer,I hadn't even thought of that.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,Wow.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"Of all the things I thought would bring us back together, catching a possum was never on that list.",2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, let's go take some pictures of Fairway Frank.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Of the possum.,2,18
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, man, when you wear these clothes, you just feel better than everyone else.",2,18
Tom Haverford,You know?,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.,2,18
Ron Swanson,Busy?,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,No.,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,What's up?,2,18
Ron Swanson,"Just wanted to tell you, I understand that city codes exist, and I know why they exist.",2,18
Ron Swanson,And I understand that you enforce them.,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,2,18
Ron Swanson,Okay.,2,18
Ron Swanson,Good talk.,2,18
Ron Swanson,Can you sign off on my plans now?,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,Did you get everything up to code?,2,18
Ron Swanson,Yup.,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, you didn't!",2,18
mr,You clearly didn't!,2,18
Ron Swanson,"It's my property, my land, my shop.",2,18
Tom Haverford,Ooh.,2,18
Tom Haverford,Tommy needs a banana.,2,18
Tom Haverford,You guys good?,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, you're asking me to do a bad job at my job, and I'm just not gonna do that.",2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, if you don't mind, would you please just get out of my office?",2,18
Tom Haverford,Ooh.,2,18
Tom Haverford,Silly me.,2,18
Tom Haverford,There was this little pom-pom on my glove and it fell off.,2,18
Tom Haverford,Have you seen it?,2,18
Tom Haverford,Could you help me look for it real quick?,2,18
Tom Haverford,It should be on the ground somewhere.,2,18
Tom Haverford,When I was putting it up.,2,18
Tom Haverford,Let's see.,2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, how's your hole?",2,18
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?,2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The pit.,2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Lot 48.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're making really good progress on the park.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"So, this isn't a really big story, right?",2,18
Leslie Knope,Nobody cares about this very much.,2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, Fairway Frank did bite the mayor's dog.",2,18
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, this could be on the front page.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"Fairway Frank, You're gonna die, You're gonna fry, oh, yeah, You guilty son of a bitch, You're gonna fry, When they flip that switch.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?",2,18
April Ludgate,No.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, ""What?""",2,18
Leslie Knope,"But then you thought, maybe it's not a whale.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a big fish.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?",2,18
April Ludgate,I don't know what you're talking about.,2,18
Leslie Knope,I saw a second possum!,2,18
Leslie Knope,There was another possum!,2,18
April Ludgate,Wait.,2,18
April Ludgate,"Andy's in there talking to a reporter, literally kissing his own biceps and you're telling me he might not be a hero, but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums?",2,18
April Ludgate,No.,2,18
April Ludgate,I've gotta help Leslie find the truth.,2,18
April Ludgate,"Not because I'm pissed at Andy, which I'm not.",2,18
April Ludgate,Because I care so deeply about possums.,2,18
April Ludgate,Because they're so adorable.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,April!,2,18
Andy Dwyer,Did you see my photo shoot?,2,18
Andy Dwyer,I think I nailed it.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"I fell off the stool once when I was trying to look serious, but I'm okay.",2,18
April Ludgate,That's cool.,2,18
April Ludgate,I'm really happy for you.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,You are?,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"Man, our happy reactions are super different.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"So, he said he's gonna email me the photos in, like, six hours.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,Do you want to wait with me?,2,18
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that sounds good, but I can't because I have to go do something that actually matters.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.,2,18
Leslie Knope,You must know him pretty well.,2,18
Joe Campopiano,Sure do.,2,18
Joe Campopiano,I've chased that little sucker off more times than I can count.,2,18
April Ludgate,Can you just take a look at these photos and make sure that it's Fairway Frank?,2,18
Joe Campopiano,"Yup, that's him.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Campopiano, those are photos of three different possums.",2,18
Joe Campopiano,Huh.,2,18
Joe Campopiano,You guys want something to drink?,2,18
Mike,"Hey, boss.",2,18
Mike,There's a possum wandering around on the 14th green.,2,18
Mike,Should I call Animal Control again?,2,18
Joe Campopiano,Yeah.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Those idiots are here from Animal Control.,2,18
Leslie Knope,They're gonna take it away.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,18
Leslie Knope,We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have an idea.",2,18
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Can you do that, April?",2,18
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do that?",2,18
Leslie Knope,Can you get the possum out of here?,2,18
Leslie Knope,Can you sneak it out of here?,2,18
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do it?",2,18
Leslie Knope,Can you do it?,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Please, April, tell me you can do it!",2,18
April Ludgate,Yes.,2,18
April Ludgate,"Yes, I can do it.",2,18
April Ludgate,God.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word ""lieutenant.""",2,18
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now.,2,18
Brett,"Let's make it happen, Captain.",2,18
Harris,Don't call me that.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Help! Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding!",2,18
Jerry Gergich,Holy cow! Leslie!,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look how much it's bleeding.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Everybody look at it.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Everybody look over here! I need everyone's full attention during this.,2,18
Jerry Gergich,That's a lot of blood.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's so--",2,18
Donna Meagle,It's ketchup!,2,18
Leslie Knope,Is it?,2,18
Leslie Knope,Jerry.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Jerry.,2,18
Jerry Gergich,Yes.,2,18
Jerry Gergich,It's ketchup.,2,18
TV,Sentry duty is usually approximately one hour long.,2,18
TV,Baby meerkats do not start foraging for food until about one month old.,2,18
April Ludgate,Do you know them?,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,What do you mean that Fairway Frank is not here?,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Leslie, whoever it is, it's a possum.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"And the sooner it's dead, the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it.",2,18
Leslie Knope,Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,No!,2,18
Leslie Knope,No.,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,He's not a monster.,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Ew!,2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Now, Leslie, you did a great job, and the mayor knows that you did a great job.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Now, where is the possum?",2,18
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go.",2,18
Leslie Knope,This is interesting.,2,18
Leslie Knope,They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island.,2,18
Tom Haverford,Wow.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid.",2,18
Leslie Knope,But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose.,2,18
Tom Haverford,That's great.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"No, it's awful, Tom.",2,18
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if you killed an innocent duck and let a vicious goose waddle free?,2,18
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.,2,18
April Ludgate,"Tom! It's April, I'm at Ann's house and the possum's loose! Okay? I need your help!",2,18
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! It's chewing on everything! Don't tell Leslie.",2,18
Tom Haverford,You got it.,2,18
Tom Haverford,The possum got loose at Ann's house.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!",2,18
Leslie Knope,"April! April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department.",2,18
April Ludgate,"Stop ringing the doorbell, it's making him mad.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God! How did this happen?",2,18
April Ludgate,"I let it out of its cage because it needed water, and I thought it would just drink out of the toilet or something, but then it ran off and I couldn't get it back in.",2,18
April Ludgate,"He did that, too.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy.",2,18
April Ludgate,"Yeah, and then I opened all the doors because I thought it would just go outside, but it won't leave the house! It must love tacky pictures of flowers.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay.",2,18
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna fix this.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Let me just think for a second.,2,18
April Ludgate,Uh-oh.,2,18
Leslie Knope,What?,2,18
April Ludgate,Where is it?,2,18
April Ludgate,I can't see it!,2,18
Leslie Knope,"No! Okay, where did it go?",2,18
April Ludgate,I don't know! I don't know.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Here's what we do, we just go outside.",2,18
Leslie Knope,All right? Let's just go outside! Get in here!,2,18
Ron Swanson,I haven't even started yet.,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,I know.,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,Thought you could use some help.,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,Those city planning guys can be real pains in the ass.,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.,2,18
Ron Swanson,I just want you to know that I still don't think city codes--,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, shut up.",2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,"Would you, please?",2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm taking a half day off to come and help you out because you're my friend, so just shut up.",2,18
Ron Swanson,"No, I am bringing my workshop up to the Swanson Code.",2,18
Ron Swanson,And if the Swanson Code happens to overlap with the City Government Code--,2,18
Mark Brendanawicz,Shut up.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"I know there's a door there, but I kind of feel like it's going to chew through the door and come and jump on my face and bite me.",2,18
April Ludgate,Ew.,2,18
April Ludgate,I know!,2,18
Leslie Knope,What if it's in here?,2,18
April Ludgate,What if it laid eggs in the bed?,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there, there are no eggs! You know, we should've killed it.",2,18
Leslie Knope,It's so huge.,2,18
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna call Andy.,2,18
April Ludgate,No.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"He tackled it once before, he can do it again.",2,18
April Ludgate,"No, please don't, okay? He's gonna be pissed at me.",2,18
April Ludgate,"I already ruined his big day, and it's my fault that it's in Ann's house, who he's obviously still in love with.",2,18
April Ludgate,"I just-- I don't want him to be mad at me, okay?",2,18
Leslie Knope,Oh.,2,18
Leslie Knope,April.,2,18
Leslie Knope,He'll forgive you.,2,18
April Ludgate,You think so?,2,18
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,18
Leslie Knope,We don't have to call Andy.,2,18
Leslie Knope,We can just call Animal Control.,2,18
April Ludgate,Okay.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"And, April, any time you want to talk about boys--",2,18
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! Stop!",2,18
Andy Dwyer,Yo.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,"So, I feel like you were mad at me yesterday and I don't know why.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"So, I made a list of everything I did and I'm gonna try not to do any of them again.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,"Also, I got you this coffee.",2,18
Andy Dwyer,And then there's this.,2,18
Andy Dwyer,Fourth paragraph down.,2,18

Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, Miss Knope.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,I have to say I'm very disappointed.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"You didn't have to say that, you could've just thought it.",2,18
Evelyn Rowshlind,"What did you do with the possum, exactly?",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it.",2,18
Leslie Knope,It's okay.,2,18
Leslie Knope,Honestly.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"When I retire and I'm attending some gala honoring the first three female presidents in history, myself and two other women I've inspired, I want to be looking back at my distinguished legacy and not thinking that I owe my career to some possum.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"And I want to be wearing a huge, beautiful, blue hat!",2,18
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.,2,18
April Ludgate,Sure.,2,18
Ann Perkins,It made me feel so happy that I knew somebody was here taking care of my house.,2,18
April Ludgate,Cool.,2,18
Ann Perkins,"So, did the neighbors give you any problems?",2,18
April Ludgate,No.,2,18
Ann Perkins,Anything in--,2,18
Leslie Knope,Possum.,2,18
Leslie Knope,There was a possum.,2,18
Leslie Knope,We captured a possum and we brought it into your house and it got out and it might have laid eggs in your bed.,2,18
Ann Perkins,What?,2,18
Leslie Knope,"And it went into your laundry and your kitchen, and it touched all your bras and I'm so sorry.",2,18
Leslie Knope,It's our fault.,2,18
Leslie Knope,We captured it and it got out and it ran around and it was a possum.,2,18
Leslie Knope,"Okay? April, run! Run, April.",2,18
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, Ann! I love you!",2,18
April Ludgate,I'm gonna go.,2,18

Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jerry.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,I was on my way to the hummingbird feeders and I was walking Lord Sheldon.,2,19
April Ludgate,Ew!,2,19
April Ludgate,Is that code for some kind of weird sex act?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Lord Sheldon is my dog.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,My wife named him.,2,19
April Ludgate,Ew!,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, these kids, they came out of nowhere, they pinned my arm back, they grabbed my wallet, and they knocked me to the ground.",2,19
Ron Swanson,How did you counterattack?,2,19
Ron Swanson,Fist to the throat?,2,19
Ron Swanson,Did you hit him in the beanbag?,2,19
Ron Swanson,There's no shame in attacking a criminal's beanbag.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"No, I just curled up and laid still until they left.",2,19
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's another way to play it.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Did any of them have weird tattoos or scars or anything?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"If even one of them had a unique scar, we got them.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,I didn't get a good look.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,19
Leslie Knope,You're the victim.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,19
Leslie Knope,I feel like we're responsible for this.,2,19
April Ludgate,Why?,2,19
April Ludgate,We didn't mug Jerry.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Well, why was he in the park in the first place?",2,19
Tom Haverford,Because we tricked him into going there.,2,19
Tom Haverford,I don't see the connection.,2,19
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,2,19
Leslie Knope,This is on us.,2,19
Leslie Knope,It's karma.,2,19
Tom Haverford,Wouldn't it be karma if we were the ones that got mugged?,2,19
April Ludgate,Yeah.,2,19
April Ludgate,That's how pathetic Jerry is.,2,19
April Ludgate,He can't even get karma right.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"No, that's not funny.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Our friend got mugged this morning.,2,19
Leslie Knope,And we will not let that happen in vain.,2,19
Tom Haverford,He doesn't have a black eye.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, the whole department has a black eye.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"This is our wakeup call, guys.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Jerry's face is the symbol of failure.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Our failure to keep the parks safe.,2,19
Leslie Knope,I have some folders.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Inside are some assignments.,2,19
Leslie Knope,And some homemade taffy.,2,19
All,Mmm.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"April, I want you to check in with our police liaison.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Donna, I need you to go to Ramsett Park.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're with me.",2,19
April Ludgate,"So, when you say that you want me to check in with the police liaison, you mean hook up with him, right?",2,19
Leslie Knope,No.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Just check in with him.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Everybody dismissed.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Wait.,2,19
Ron Swanson,I want to help.,2,19
Leslie Knope,What?,2,19
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to teach everybody self-defense, so you can defend yourselves.",2,19
Leslie Knope,We need it.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Because we certainly are a bunch of weaklings.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Especially Tom.,2,19
Tom Haverford,I am not a weakling.,2,19
April Ludgate,Arm wrestle me right now.,2,19
Tom Haverford,Okay.,2,19
Tom Haverford,I think I'm more than holding my own here.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Three, four, fiveâ¦",2,19
Ann Perkins,Hey.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Six.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Hey!,2,19
Andy Dwyer,How you doing?,2,19

Ann Perkins,I was just dropping off Jerry from the hospital.,2,19
Ann Perkins,He was mugged in the park.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,No.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Jerry?,2,19
Andy Dwyer,The black guy with the Looney Tunes ties?,2,19

Andy Dwyer,Oh. Oh wow.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, that's kind of a bummer, too.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, while I have you here, what do you think of this?",2,19
Andy Dwyer,Scrotation Marks.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"I don't know what you're talking about, but my gut says no.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,New band name.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Because ""Mouse Rat,"" it's a great name, but at the same time, it sucks.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"So, I think we have to change it just one more time.",2,19
Ann Perkins,"Dude, you've got to stop doing that.",2,19
Ann Perkins,How are people going to become fans if they literally don't know the name of the band they're listening to?,2,19
Andy Dwyer,That is a really good point.,2,19
Ann Perkins,I always had fun with Andy.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"The problem is, when you're his girlfriend, you're also his mother, and his maid and his nurse.",2,19
Ann Perkins,He's completely helpless.,2,19
Ann Perkins,He's like a baby in a straightjacket.,2,19
Ann Perkins,Ooh!,2,19
Ann Perkins,"""Baby in a Straightjacket.""",2,19
Ann Perkins,That's a good band name.,2,19
Ann Perkins,I should tell him that.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Haha, guys.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Really funny.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Where's the real banner?,2,19
April Ludgate,We only had an hour.,2,19

Jerry Gergich,"Honestly, what I would like to do is just have everything go back to normal.",2,19
Ron Swanson,That sounds good to me.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Okay.,2,19
Ron Swanson,I believe you were going to do a presentation.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, sir, I was.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,I will go set up.,2,19

Leslie Knope,No comments.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Nothing but support.,2,19
Tom Haverford,He needs a lot of support.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Tom.,2,19
Tom Haverford,Talking about a bra for a man.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Okay, seriously.",2,19
Leslie Knope,That was the last one.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"So, as we know, Spring Hunting Season is upon us.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, anyway, here's the info about the new licensing system.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Um Jerry?,2,19
Leslie Knope,I don't... I don't think your computer is plugged in.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, guys.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,Just got to power up.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,First thing we should have is my graph about the season.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,What?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Wait a minute.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,No.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,That is not the graph.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,That's a picture from my vacation to Muncie.,2,19
Tom Haverford,"You went on a vacation and you chose Muncie, Indiana?",2,19
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,My wife and I have a timeshare.,2,19
Tom Haverford,In Muncie?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Tom, Muncie is a lovely city.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, Hunting and Fishing Season is winding down.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,Okay?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"And we all know that it's already closed season on ""twout.""",2,19
Jerry Gergich,"So, now I said ""twout"" instead of ""trout.""",2,19
Donna Meagle,It happens to everyone.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,My marbles are full of mouth today.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,You know what?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Has anybody seen my glasses?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,I don't even think I canâ¦,2,19
Tom Haverford,"It says here ""1:00 meeting.""",2,19
Tom Haverford,And who are we meeting with?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.,2,19
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no.",2,19
Tom Haverford,"Please, no.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's important to meet with the Park Rangers.",2,19
Leslie Knope,They are the first line of defense.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Leslie Knope!,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Carl.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"What's up, pencil pushers?",2,19
Carl Lorthner,Haverford.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Good to see you, man.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,Is it hot in here?,2,19

Carl Lorthner,Are you guys hot?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,How you guys doing?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,I'm good.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,You guys got any snacks?,2,19
Tom Haverford,Carl is the head of all outdoor security.,2,19
Tom Haverford,"Why was he transferred from his indoor desk job, you ask.",2,19
Tom Haverford,Listen.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Hey, Leslie.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,Have you seen Avatar?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,I never saw Avatar.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"I wanted to read the book first, but then I realized there's no book version of Avatar.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,What did you guys do for St. Patty's Day?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"I was wearing this tshirt that said ""Kiss me, I'm Irish.""",2,19
Carl Lorthner,But no one would kiss me.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,So.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,You're too important for me until one of your own gets attacked.,2,19
Leslie Knope,I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the parks safe.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, you think you know how to do my job?",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Well, you might not be so confident once you've walked a mile in my size sevens.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Kind of small feet.,2,19
Tom Haverford,"Actually, seven is the worldwide average.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,Boom!,2,19
Ron Swanson,Welcome to the emergency self-defense class.,2,19
Ron Swanson,"I'll be showing you how to escape from a variety of situations, while inflicting maximum damage on your attackers.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, do you think that maybe I should put Mark in a headlock?",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"That way, I can show everyone how to escape a pervert?",2,19
Mark Brendanawicz,"In the scenario you just laid out, you're the pervert.",2,19
Mark Brendanawicz,"You understand that, right?",2,19
Andy Dwyer,You wish.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Enough.,2,19
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to start off simple, and demonstrate how to extract oneself from a wrist grab.",2,19
Ron Swanson,Andy.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Ann.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Step up here.,2,19
Ann Perkins,I watch a lot of Lifetime movies.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"There was this one, How Far is Too Far Enough: The Teri Palliber Lonergan Story.",2,19
Ann Perkins,"This woman had agoraphobia and her therapist was obsessed with her, and he hid in her house.",2,19
Ann Perkins,And then he attacked her and tried to eat her toes.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"Also, her daughter was having sex way too young.",2,19
Ann Perkins,"So, yeah.",2,19
Ann Perkins,Free self-defense class?,2,19
Ann Perkins,I'm there.,2,19

Andy Dwyer,That was really good.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"I don't know, Leslie.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,I'd rather be back at the office.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"I know this is painful for you, Jerry, but you have to be strong.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,You guys ready?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay.",2,19
Leslie Knope,We're ready.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you guys all the problems we've been facing.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you that we've been doing everything we can.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm looking forward to working together, Carl.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"And after that, I'm going to show you this log I found.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"It's got, like, fifty worms on it.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"I call it ""worm log.""",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Yeah, I've always been a bit of an outdoorsman.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"When I was a kid, my parents used to make me hang out in the backyard a lot and just run around until I got tired.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"But if there's any criminals out there watching, I never get tired.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"And ladies, too.",2,19
Tom Haverford,This thing is a mess.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"We used to have three carts, actually.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,The first one got pushed into the creek by some kids.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"The second one, raccoons got onto.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,There was urine everywhere.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,And the third one was recently stolen.,2,19
Tom Haverford,What's this one?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,This is the second one.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,The raccoon piss one.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,All right.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,So we're going to just head out.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, no.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,You know what?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,I think we've got too much weight.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Oh.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"That's Tom, probably.",2,19
Tom Haverford,Are you serious?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Tom, can you get off, please?",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Just run alongside the cart, okay?",2,19
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Here we go.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Whoa!,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"So, I want to tell you a little bit about the park.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,Up here on the left is one of our most beautiful grass fields.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,It's primarily grass.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"All right, I'm going to make a hard left here.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Stick with us, Tom.",2,19
Ron Swanson,Okay.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Lesson learned.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Thank you.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Next.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Andy.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Impressive.,2,19
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to engage Andy in an attack hold, and he's going to try and break free.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,Cool.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I don't want to hurt you, Ron.",2,19
Ron Swanson,Don't worry about that.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Just try to escape my attack.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Now, when I get out, am I allowed to counterstrike?",2,19
Ron Swanson,Sure.,2,19
Ron Swanson,"When you get out, you may counterattack.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"But just promise me you'll be ready, because, I mean, I don't want to destroy you.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,Okay.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,I see where we're going with this.,2,19
Ron Swanson,"Now, when your arms are pinned to your sides, use your legs to break free, instead of your neck, which is what Andy is trying to do.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, hold up.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,Get off!,2,19
April Ludgate,Let him go.,2,19
Ron Swanson,Andy.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God.",2,19
Ron Swanson,Oops.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Any of this looking familiar?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,It happened right over there.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, yeah.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,I'm not surprised.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Take a look at this path.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"With budget cuts, we can't afford a single safety light.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,There's been 10 assaults already this year.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Wow.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Really?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Can't you station a Park Ranger out here?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,We have!,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Who do you think they're assaulting?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,I'm sorry.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,I didn't mean to yell.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"One way or another, I'm going to get money so you can protect Jerry, and all the other helpless, pathetic people in this town.",2,19
Tom Haverford,You guys have got to slow down.,2,19
Tom Haverford,Can I just take a rest for a minute?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,19
Leslie Knope,No can do.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Sun's going down and it's real dangerous out here.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Let's roll, Carl.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,Okay.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Going fast.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"Okay, what day is it today?",2,19
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.,2,19
April Ludgate,"Okay, but to be fair, you never know.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,That's kind of true.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,I'm super bad at days.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"But honestly, I'm fine.",2,19
Ron Swanson,"Sorry I squeezed your lights out there, son.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,No worries.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Will you show me how to do that move, though?",2,19
Ron Swanson,Sure.,2,19
Ron Swanson,I can teach you right now--,2,19
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no.",2,19
Ann Perkins,"Andy, you should really just take it easy, I think.",2,19
Ann Perkins,Do you want some more water?,2,19
Ann Perkins,Or maybe some pancakes?,2,19
Andy Dwyer,No.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm fine.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.,2,19
Ron Swanson,What is the first move in any fight?,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Punch to the balls.,2,19
Joan Callamezzo,We've all heard the old saying.,2,19
Joan Callamezzo,"""Parks are supposed to be fun.""",2,19
Joan Callamezzo,"But sometimes, muggers have their own ideas.",2,19
Joan Callamezzo,Leslie Knope is with us again from the Parks Department.,2,19
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, tell us your story.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"This is my coworker, Jerry Gergich.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Diabetic.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Sloppily out of shape.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Friend.,2,19
Leslie Knope,He was mugged this morning in Ramsett Park.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Who's next?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Your frumpy uncle?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Your simple neighbor?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Your unpopular coworker?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Head of security, Carl Lorthner, is doing his best to keep the parks safe, but he's failing.",2,19
Joan Callamezzo,"So, what is the solution to fix this?",2,19
Joan Callamezzo,To make it right.,2,19
Joan Callamezzo,And not bad.,2,19
Leslie Knope,We need money from City Hall.,2,19
Leslie Knope,And it's not coming through.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee, I am sorry to say this, but your government is failing you.",2,19
Joan Callamezzo,"Up next, 10 objects you didn't know you can eat.",2,19
Paul,What possessed you to do that?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys got mugged in the park.",2,19
Paul,I don't care how upset you are.,2,19
Paul,You do not badmouth your own government on TV.,2,19
Paul,I'm sure you'll be happy to know your little stunt worked.,2,19
Paul,The Mayor is going to divert 2500 dollars to the Parks for security upgrades.,2,19
Paul,There's going to be an announcement tomorrow at 10:00 in the press room.,2,19
Paul,So... Make sure you bring the doofus who got his ass kicked.,2,19
Leslie Knope,I don't know who you're referring to.,2,19
Leslie Knope,We treat everyone with respect around here.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,19
Paul,Good morning.,2,19
Paul,"As many of you know, there was an incident involving a government employee in Ramsett Park.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you nervous?",2,19
Leslie Knope,Just talk about how hard it was for you.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Speak from the heart.,2,19
Leslie Knope,You'll be fine.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't mugged.,2,19
Paul,...safety of our citizens.,2,19
Paul,That's why we're here today to give Pawneeâ¦,2,19
Paul,Jerry?,2,19
Paul,Why don't you step on up here?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"No, I will.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Get up here.,2,19
Leslie Knope,I'm going to speak for Jerry.,2,19
Leslie Knope,He can't talk right now because he has hysterical muteness from trauma.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Correct.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Jerry.,2,19
Leslie Knope,What about this?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Huh?,2,19
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,This is real.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,I really dislocated my shoulder.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Were you even in the park yesterday?,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"Look, I was on my way to feed the hummingbirds, and I stopped for a breakfast burrito.",2,19
Leslie Knope,The farting.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,2,19
Jerry Gergich,"And Lord Sheldon, he lunged at a bird, I dropped the burrito, and it landed on a log in the creek.",2,19
Jerry Gergich,"So, I go to reach for it, I lose my balance, and I fall on my shoulder really weird.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Well, why didn't you just tell everybody the truth?",2,19
Jerry Gergich,Are you kidding me? Imagine what Tom would have said.,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Jerry! You jumped in a creek for a burrito? What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Kill your wife?",2,19
Andy Dwyer,Block the opponent's punch and counter-punch to the jaw.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine?,2,19
Ann Perkins,Hey.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Oh! Hey! Ann Perkins, in the ""shoe-shouse.""",2,19
Ann Perkins,I wanted to check in.,2,19
Ann Perkins,I brought some stuff from the hospital.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"Water, a compress, aspirin, some lollipops, I know you love those.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, you know, thank you.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,"But really, I'm feeling great.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,I took a couple of aspirin and slept right through the night.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,And-- Hold on a second.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Ludgate.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,What the hell? I got you one of those veggie muffins that you're always eating.,2,19
April Ludgate,Score.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,It tastes like a rug.,2,19
April Ludgate,Shut up.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Don't hit me.,2,19
Ann Perkins,Good.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.",2,19
Andy Dwyer,I am.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for that.,2,19
Andy Dwyer,That's so cool.,2,19
Ann Perkins,"Since when did he start doing stuff for other people? Now, I actually am worried that something happened to his brain.",2,19
Ann Perkins,"People change, I guess.",2,19
Mark Brendanawicz,Wouldn't you rather the money go to keeping the parks safe?,2,19
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but now, we have the money under false pretenses.",2,19
Mark Brendanawicz,I actually think that you have a bigger problem than the money.,2,19
Leslie Knope,What?,2,19
Mark Brendanawicz,"There is someone in your department who is willing to lie about being mugged, because he's afraid of his co-workers.",2,19
Leslie Knope,Knope.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Yep.,2,19
Leslie Knope,No.,2,19
Leslie Knope,Carl.,2,19
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, Leslie.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,"Well, since you decided to drag my name through the mud on TV, I figured why not return the favor.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Carl, could you quietly quiet down for a second, and please tell me what is going on, quietly? Okay? In a quiet voice.",2,19
Carl Lorthner,A citizen handed in a very interesting home video that I think the people of Pawnee will find very interesting.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Take a peek at this.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Keep your eyes on the creek.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,There he is.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,This is my favorite part.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,Not willing to share with a dog.,2,19
Carl Lorthner,"So, it would appear that Park Security was not to blame after all.",2,19
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look.",2,19
Leslie Knope,I have a proposition for you.,2,19

Leslie Knope,Right after I watch it one more time.,2,19

Tom Haverford,"Damn, girl!",2,20
Tom Haverford,Your hotness killed my raccoon!,2,20
Tom Haverford,I have a raccoon hat.,2,20

Leslie Knope,"And the big surprise is I am going to reunite all the living former Parks Directors at a picnic, record the whole thing, and then write about it in the ""Welcome Letter.""",2,20
Leslie Knope,It's the biggest catalog of the year.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Think of the September issue of Vogue.,2,20
Leslie Knope,But it's more important to Pawnee.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna move this ""Yearning"" ad to the centerfold.",2,20

Leslie Knope,"Okay, April.",2,20
Leslie Knope,Enough.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Cover photo.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're up.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"This catalog is basically, like, an ad for the Parks Department, and I love ads.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"I love magazine ads for flavored vodkas, billboards for designer jeans.",2,20
Tom Haverford,I TiVo through shows to get to the ads.,2,20
Tom Haverford,I love ads.,2,20
Tom Haverford,What are we trying to do with this catalog?,2,20
Tom Haverford,We're trying to sell Pawnee on our summer classes.,2,20
Tom Haverford,How do we do that?,2,20
Tom Haverford,"With one perfect, captivating image.",2,20

Leslie Knope,"Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"One, this is a summer catalog.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Two, that was complete gibberish.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"And three, that child looks like it's abandoned.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"So, basically, boo.",2,20
Tom Haverford,Next slide.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God.",2,20
Tom Haverford,Weird.,2,20
Tom Haverford,How did that... That's a personal photo.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"That's... Shouldn't be.. This must've... You know, I gotta say, I think that could actually work as our cover photo.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"I'm cool with it, if you guys are.",2,20
Tom Haverford,It's a high-res photo.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"I don't know if I have time for this, guys, so, let's just pick a good photo, okay?",2,20
Tom Haverford,"What do you want, Leslie?",2,20
Tom Haverford,A picture of parents pushing a kid on a swing?,2,20

Andy Dwyer,Oh!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,That one hurt.,2,20

Andy Dwyer,Shut up!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,I played baseball in high school.,2,20
April Ludgate,Shut up!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that's like, the boy version of softball.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Guys, don't play with the food, okay?",2,20

Leslie Knope,Smoked salmon?,2,20
Andy Dwyer,April threw the smoked salmon on the roof.,2,20
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.,2,20
Ann Perkins,Where's Leslie?,2,20
Ann Perkins,She just texted me from your phone and said she left her phone at home and that I should come here immediately.,2,20
Ann Perkins,And why did I believe that?,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Maybe in your heart you knew it was from me, but you came anyway.",2,20
Ann Perkins,Nope.,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, would you please stop texting me that you're having a city planning emergency?",2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no such thing as a city planning emergency.,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, there.",2,20
Ann Perkins,Hi.,2,20
Tom Haverford,Look at you two.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Ann Perkins, Mark Brendanawicz.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"""Anndanawicz.""",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Or ""Merkins.""",2,20
Tom Haverford,"No, ""Anndanawicz.""",2,20
Tom Haverford,You two should be models.,2,20
Tom Haverford,Maybe on the cover of the Parks Department Summer Catalog?,2,20
Ann Perkins,"That's not the reason you called me in here, right?",2,20
Ann Perkins,Cause I just finished a 12 hour shift.,2,20
Ann Perkins,If that's the reason--,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ann.",2,20
Tom Haverford,It'd be a huge favor for Leslie.,2,20
Tom Haverford,You know how important this is to her.,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I am in.",2,20
Ann Perkins,Dude!,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,I am.,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,We don't have any pictures of just the two of us.,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,"Plus, I've always said we should go on more dates with Tom.",2,20
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you have.",2,20
Ann Perkins,And thank God an opportunity presented itself.,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,See?,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,Win win.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Now, Ann, you're gonna change, right?",2,20
Ann Perkins,I guess.,2,20
Tom Haverford,Would it kill you to maybe put on some lipstick?,2,20
Tom Haverford,Do you even own lipstick?,2,20
Leslie Knope,This is probably the first time in history these four great men have been in the same place at the same time.,2,20
Leslie Knope,It kind of makes you-- What is this?,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Sweater swap!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,She noticed!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,You were right.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",2,20
Leslie Knope,Somebody's here.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Guys, just act normal.",2,20

Leslie Knope,It is such an honor to meet you.,2,20
David Moser,Right.,2,20
David Moser,How long is this gonna take?,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, not very long.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"I realize, of course, you're a very busy man.",2,20
Leslie Knope,I love parks.,2,20
Leslie Knope,I don't know if that's something I've communicated before.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"So, having a picnic with all the former living Parks Department Directors-- Guess who just checked something off her bucket list?",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson, gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park.",2,20
Leslie Knope,I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.,2,20
David Moser,"I thought you were dead, Clarence.",2,20
Clarence Carrington,No.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,"I'm gonna outlive you, then I'm gonna nail your wife.",2,20
David Moser,"Screw you, you old coot.",2,20
Michael Tansley,Classic David.,2,20
Michael Tansley,You're worse than Ron.,2,20
Ron Swanson,"Shut your damn mouth, Tansley.",2,20
Leslie Knope,Okay!,2,20
Leslie Knope,Great!,2,20
Leslie Knope,Let's go!,2,20
Leslie Knope,"When I say ""parks,"" you say ""department!""",2,20
Leslie Knope,Parks!,2,20
Leslie Knope,Parks!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Apartment!,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy.",2,20
Leslie Knope,This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Can you guys run up ahead and set up the picnic?,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Sure.,2,20
Ron Swanson,Oh.,2,20
Ron Swanson,Where are they going with the food?,2,20
Ron Swanson,I'm starving.,2,20
Ron Swanson,I only had one breakfast.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, relax.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Look, what was going on back there?",2,20
Leslie Knope,Why all the sniping?,2,20
Ron Swanson,Not exactly sure.,2,20
Ron Swanson,"The only one I know is Michael, and we're not exactly best friends.",2,20
Leslie Knope,Hmm.,2,20
Ron Swanson,I'm hungry.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, don't be such a baby.",2,20
Leslie Knope,I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.,2,20
Ron Swanson,I ate it already.,2,20
Leslie Knope,What?,2,20
Ron Swanson,I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car.,2,20
Ron Swanson,And now it's gone.,2,20
Ron Swanson,And I hate everything.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Good, good, good.",2,20
Tom Haverford,All right.,2,20
Tom Haverford,I think we got the boring cliche shot that Leslie wanted.,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,That's it?,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,We're done?,2,20
Tom Haverford,Not even close.,2,20
Tom Haverford,Now the real art begins.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Step one, nail this photo shoot with an amazing, iconic image.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Step two, book some outside gigs.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Step three, have sex with a model.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Step four, step in front of the camera, become a model.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Go, yes!",2,20
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!,2,20
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Ann, can you give me something, anything, in the face?",2,20
Ann Perkins,What do you want me to do?,2,20
Tom Haverford,Do what Mark's doing.,2,20
Tom Haverford,He's doing great!,2,20
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!,2,20
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm not doing anything, soâ¦",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog.",2,20
Clarence Carrington,I remember.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,That first year we offered four classes.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,I actually taught Homemaking.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,Women were not allowed to teach back then.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Really?,2,20
Leslie Knope,I thought there were female teachers way before then.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,Not in my department.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, times have changed.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department.",2,20
Clarence Carrington,"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.",2,20
Clarence Carrington,"Women need a lot of blood to flow through to their baby centers, which leaves less to the brain, you see.",2,20
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Sure.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,"I'd stay away from leadership roles, for your own safety.",2,20
April Ludgate,No!,2,20
April Ludgate,No!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I should write a song about a picnic.,2,20
April Ludgate,"Ooh, where'd you come up with that idea?",2,20
Andy Dwyer,The picnic we're having.,2,20
Andy Dwyer,"I already have the perfect title, Life is a Picnic.",2,20
April Ludgate,That's good.,2,20
April Ludgate,How about Life is a Picnic with You?,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Then it could be about a girl.,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Or Peyton Manning!,2,20
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.,2,20
Andy Dwyer,You wanna help me write the lyrics?,2,20
April Ludgate,"Yeah, totally.",2,20
Andy Dwyer,We should grab a drink after this at Tucker's.,2,20
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I would do that.",2,20
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.,2,20
April Ludgate,I just have to get my stuff from the office.,2,20
April Ludgate,But that's-- That'd be cool.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?",2,20
David Moser,"Well, I was in Public Works for eight years.",2,20
David Moser,But the director was pretty young.,2,20
David Moser,Clarence was old and weak.,2,20
David Moser,"So, I put in for a transfer, swooped in and pushed him out.",2,20
Leslie Knope,There was no other reason you wanted the job?,2,20
David Moser,No.,2,20
David Moser,Just the money and the pension.,2,20
David Moser,The actual job's a nightmare.,2,20
David Moser,"I mean, who gives a crap about this crap.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, David, I think we've talked enough.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Mark, that's great.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, great.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Ann, you look miserable!",2,20
Tom Haverford,Terrible.,2,20
Tom Haverford,Terrible!,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ann.",2,20
Tom Haverford,What are we doing?,2,20
Tom Haverford,Maxim or Good Housekeeping?,2,20
Ann Perkins,I'm not sure which one is the insult.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Hey, if there's anyone out there that's doing a photo shoot about the dangers of eating undercooked chicken, I can give you Ann's phone number.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's stop for a second.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, I love how you work.",2,20
Bobby,Yay!,2,20
Tom Haverford,You can have as many juice boxes as you want.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"In fact, grab me one, too.",2,20
Tom Haverford,Make it an apple.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Mark, great job, you can have a juice box, too.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Ann, take a walk with me.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"In a million years, I never thought you would be the problem with this photo shoot.",2,20
Ann Perkins,"Didn't you just plan this, like, two hours ago?",2,20
Tom Haverford,I just don't get it.,2,20
Tom Haverford,How could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot?,2,20
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry I'm not a professional model.,2,20
Ann Perkins,"And screaming, ""Make your face better!"" doesn't help.",2,20
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm sorry, your face just isn't working.",2,20
Tom Haverford,And we need to do something to distract from this boring area.,2,20
Tom Haverford,"Now, I didn't want to have to do this, but we may have to go nude.",2,20
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Tom!",2,20
Tom Haverford,Fair enough.,2,20
Tom Haverford,I totally understand.,2,20
Tom Haverford,But we should get one for safety.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys.",2,20
Leslie Knope,We're almost there.,2,20
Leslie Knope,It's right up here.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,You really shouldn't be leading us.,2,20
Clarence Carrington,"If you're menstruating, you'll attract bears.",2,20
Leslie Knope,Holy God.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Here we are.,2,20
Ron Swanson,Eat.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, it hasn't gone exactly as I've hoped.",2,20
Leslie Knope,But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.,2,20
Leslie Knope,It's gonna-- It's gonna be good.,2,20
David Moser,Hey.,2,20
David Moser,I just whizzed on a butterfly!,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog.",2,20
David Moser,You should just copy the Eagleton one.,2,20
David Moser,I used to just copy the Eagleton one.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Did you?,2,20
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.,2,20
Michael Tansley,"Well, I think you've done a wonderful job maintaining the parks.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Michael.",2,20
Leslie Knope,I appreciate that.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?,2,20
Michael Tansley,"Oh, in a way.",2,20
Michael Tansley,"Pencil pushing wasn't really my thing, but I did love the parks themselves.",2,20
Michael Tansley,That was the best part of the job.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, isn't it?",2,20
Leslie Knope,I totally agree.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank goodness for you.",2,20
Ron Swanson,"Yes, thank goodness for Michael.",2,20

Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron.",2,20
Leslie Knope,You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter? Nothing.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with.,2,20
Ron Swanson,Did you print this out? I heard the printer going.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Yes.,2,20

Leslie Knope,"Ron! That sucked, today.",2,20
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry.,2,20
Ron Swanson,There's no other way to say it.,2,20
Ron Swanson,They're a bunch of career bureaucrats.,2,20
Ron Swanson,What did you think they were gonna say to you?,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain that stretches back to when our town was founded, and we believe in you and we support you and we'll be following your career.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"""You are the chosen one.""",2,20
Leslie Knope,Or something.,2,20
Ron Swanson,"Well, okay, so, that was the problem.",2,20
Leslie Knope,No.,2,20
Leslie Knope,You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director.,2,20
Leslie Knope,But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Are we gonna hate each other someday?,2,20
Ron Swanson,I don't think so.,2,20
Ron Swanson,I think we're gonna be fine.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, soâ¦ Maybe I should go somewhere.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I should move, to Eagleton.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, the thought of that.",2,20
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you don't have to move to Eagleton.",2,20
Ron Swanson,"When I become City Manager, my job is yours.",2,20
Ron Swanson,"Of course, my first act as City Manager will be to propose eliminating the Parks Department.",2,20
Ron Swanson,Although I expect a spirited debate with Leslie.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Who knows what the future holds for me?,2,20
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department.",2,20
Leslie Knope,"Although, I do expect a fight from Ron.",2,20
Leslie Knope,But I'll win.,2,20
Ron Swanson,Mmm!,2,20
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, darling.",2,20
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food?,2,20
Ron Swanson,"People are idiots, Leslie.",2,20
Jerry Gergich,The wait is over!,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!",2,20
Jerry Gergich,Yeah! Look what's here.,2,20
Jerry Gergich,We got--,2,20

Leslie Knope,"""Make the most of it, while you can.""",2,20
Leslie Knope,"""I recently had the honor of spending an afternoon""with every living former Parks Director, and they taught me a valuable lesson, there is nothing more important than friendship.""",2,20
Ron Swanson,It's a little flowery.,2,20
Leslie Knope,Shut up.,2,20
Ron Swanson,I gotta hand it to Michael.,2,20
Ron Swanson,His water pipe making skills were most impressive.,2,20
Ron Swanson,I once saw him smoke pot out of a 20-foot length of garden hose and a milk jug.,2,20
Ron Swanson,That guy made a water pipe out of a stuffed raccoon.,2,20
Leslie Knope,No way.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not kidding.",2,20
Leslie Knope,He made a bong out of a taxidermied raccoon?,2,20
Ron Swanson,I caught him smoking pot out of it not three feet from where we're standing.,2,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, nice shot.",2,20

Mark Brendanawicz,Good idea?,2,21
Mark Brendanawicz,Bad idea?,2,21
Mark Brendanawicz,You tell me.,2,21
Leslie Knope,"I would say that some women won't consider moving in with someone unless they think marriage is in the future, which I know, for you is--",2,21
Mark Brendanawicz,I intend to marry her.,2,21
Leslie Knope,For realskies?,2,21

April Ludgate,Why are there six people outside who say they're waiting to meet with me?,2,21
April Ludgate,"So, you know how you love me because you haven't had a single meeting with anyone since I became your assistant?",2,21
April Ludgate,"That's because every time someone calls and requests a meeting with you, I always schedule it for March 31st.",2,21
Ron Swanson,Why?,2,21
April Ludgate,Because I didn't think March 31st existed.,2,21
April Ludgate,"Thirty days has September, April, March and November--",2,21

Ron Swanson,Just-- Why don't we just stick to these 93 and see how it goes?,2,21
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay.",2,21

April Ludgate,"Thank you, Leslie.",2,23
Ron Swanson,Open mine.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's nice. I mean it can be a little sentimental to kind of frame things, but its always nice to remember the beginning of something, you know, the start. And when you--",2,23
April Ludgate,Ah!,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for God's sake.",2,23

April Ludgate,Yes.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,That high five was your birthday present.,2,23

Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,23
April Ludgate,What's it called?,2,23

Leslie Knope,"In the words of the great 19th century outdoorsman Jack London, you can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"With those words ringing in our ears, we proudly present our plans for a new park on municipal lot 48.",2,23
Ann Perkins,That's good!,2,23
Leslie Knope,I know.,2,23
Leslie Knope,The yearly budget and planning proposal for a city is called the Master Plan.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Isn't that just so awesome you can't stand it?,2,23
Leslie Knope,"It's mostly filled with boring, bureaucratic language, so I try to spice it up a little.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry rot.",2,23
Ann Perkins,You wrote that?,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Jack London, again.",2,23
Leslie Knope,Is there too many Jack London quotes?,2,23
Ann Perkins,"No, no.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, you can never have enough.",2,23
Ann Perkins,That is easily the most exciting budget proposal I have ever heard.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm presenting it today.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"And if it flies, we are going to get our money to build a park.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it only took us 15 months to do this.",2,23
Ann Perkins,I can't believe it.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Would've taken 13 months if you had agreed to work on weekends, but still, it's great.",2,23
Ann Perkins,It's amazing.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Well, the meeting's at 10:00, come over to my office for champagne after.",2,23
Ann Perkins,I don't think I should do that.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Oh right, Mark. Oh, awkward.",2,23
Ann Perkins,I ended things with Mark a couple of days ago.,2,23
Ann Perkins,"And, I'm not gonna talk about it.",2,23
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your final warning.",2,23
Tom Haverford,Do not miss tonight's April Ludgate birthday bash.,2,23
Tom Haverford,"9:00 P.M. at the world famous Snakehole Lounge, the place that the Pawnee Jounal has called the sexiest, most dangerous club in town.",2,23
Leslie Knope,That's not what they wrote.,2,23
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I added the world ""sexiest,"" but we've hired better security.",2,23
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am a good friend for throwing the party.",2,23
Tom Haverford,"I'm also a genius, because I'm using the occasion to stock the club with every available hottie I know.",2,23
Tom Haverford,"Call me a romantic, but I believe by the end of the night, I will have between one and four new girlfriends.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I can't believe our little girl's all grown up.",2,23

Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,23
Ron Swanson,Nice.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go boss. We have a meeting to go to.",2,23
Ron Swanson,Yay.,2,23
Ron Swanson,"Once a year, every branch of this government meets in a room and announces what they intend to waste taxpayer money on.",2,23
Ron Swanson,"For a libertarian such as myself, it's philosophically horrifying. They also really cheap out on snacks.",2,23
Ron Swanson,Hydrax cookies? Did you know there was a off-brand Hydrox? I did not. They're not bad.,2,23
Paul,"Good morning, everybody.",2,23
Paul,"I know you all have your budget presentations ready, but there's a change of plans.",2,23
Paul,"Due to the crippling gridlock in City Council, we are postponing all planning and spending decisions indefinitely.",2,23
Leslie Knope,Until when?,2,23
Paul,Indefinitely.,2,23
Leslie Knope,And when will that end?,2,23
Paul,Later than now.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"So this week, probably?",2,23
Paul,"Look, we are bordering on a full-blown crisis, Leslie.",2,23
Paul,The state government is sending a team from Indianapolis to try to solve this budget problem.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"""In the event the master plan meeting is cut short"", ""in the event I have laryngitis and I present the master plan"", ""in the event the master plan meeting is moved onto a boat.""",2,23
Leslie Knope,Look I'm prepared for every sitautionâ¦ except for the one where there's no master plan.,2,23
Ron Swanson,Just calm down.,2,23
Ron Swanson,You don't even know what they're going to do.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Ron, they're state auditors.",2,23
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna come to pat us on the back.,2,23
Leslie Knope,They're here to slash and burn.,2,23
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'd be fine with that. This government is diseased.",2,23
Ron Swanson,"It's like a big, fat, angry slob spending money it doesn't have on crap it doesn't need.",2,23
Ron Swanson,"Mmm, mmm, mmm, me want more pointless social programs.",2,23
Ron Swanson,"Yummy, yummy, yum.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"That's what government does, Ron.",2,23
Leslie Knope,It provides services.,2,23
Leslie Knope,They're going to try to eliminate everything we do.,2,23
Leslie Knope,We got to fight these guys.,2,23
Ron Swanson,They've been sent by the Governor.,2,23
Ron Swanson,They outrank everyone.,2,23
Ron Swanson,There's no fight to be had here.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right.",2,23
Leslie Knope,I'm not going to fight them.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Except that I am.,2,23
Ron Swanson,"Okay, Leslie, what do we do when we get this angry?",2,23
Leslie Knope,"We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens, and we think of warm brownies.",2,23
Ron Swanson,Go do that in your office.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Go do it in your office.,2,23
Ron Swanson,And we'll wait for these guys to show up.,2,23
Leslie Knope,I'll wait for you to show up.,2,23
Tom Haverford,You don't need to bring anything but your gorgeous body.,2,23
Tom Haverford,"And get this: cover charge is normally 15 dollars. Say my name at the door, it's 13.50.",2,23
Tom Haverford,Andy!,2,23
Andy Dwyer,Hey.,2,23
Tom Haverford,"You coming out tonight, part owner of the club?",2,23
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, let me ask you a quick question.",2,23
Andy Dwyer,"What's the youngest a girl can be that if we go out, I'm not a total scumbag?",2,23
Tom Haverford,You know the old rule.,2,23
Tom Haverford,Half your age plus seven.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,Half my age plus seven.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, okay.",2,23
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm 29, so half of 29.",2,23
Andy Dwyer,Add seven.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,That's only 20... Is...,2,23
Tom Haverford,21,2,23
Andy Dwyer,20 years old.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,21,2,23
Tom Haverford,and a half.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,21 years old and a half.,2,23
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,Yep.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,We got the same thing with the equation on that one.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,Here's the thing.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,What if she's slightly younger?,2,23
Andy Dwyer,Can I go out with someone younger than that?,2,23
Tom Haverford,"Please, you totally can.",2,23
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,Tom says it's okay.,2,23
Andy Dwyer,That probably means it isn't okay.,2,23
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you for meeting with me again.,2,23
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know really what I want to say.,2,23
Mark Brendanawicz,But I guess I just don't get it.,2,23
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, our relationship was so great.",2,23
Ann Perkins,"Mark, honestly, it was really nice.",2,23
Ann Perkins,"But maybe you thought it was so amazing, because you've never dated someone for so long before.",2,23
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, but for example, we barely ever fought.",2,23
Ann Perkins,That's not a good sign.,2,23
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to fight sometimes.,2,23
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to miss the other person even if they're only gone for 20 minutes.,2,23
Ann Perkins,And I just didn't feel that.,2,23
Ann Perkins,Did you?,2,23
Mark Brendanawicz,"Man, I should have yelled at you way more.",2,23
Ron Swanson,"Well, Paul just called.",2,23
Ron Swanson,They're on their way.,2,23
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, God.",2,23
Jerry Gergich,"They're going to fire people, aren't they?",2,23
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I am two years from my pension.",2,23
Leslie Knope,"Relax, Jerry.",2,23
Leslie Knope,We don't know that.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Maybe these people are very helpful and pleasant.,2,23
Extra,Hello?,2,23
Leslie Knope,Death!,2,23
Extra,Divorce filings?,2,23
Ron Swanson,Fourth floor.,2,23
Chris Traeger,"Hello, hello.",2,23
Chris Traeger,"Hey, how are you?",2,23

Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.,2,23
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.,2,23
Ron Swanson,Okay.,2,23
Leslie Knope,I'm Deputy Director Leslie Knope.,2,23
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.,2,23
Chris Traeger,It is fantastic to be here.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Would you gentlemen like a tour?,2,23
Chris Traeger,There is quite literally nothing I would rather have in the world than a tour of the Parks and Recreation Department of the great City of Pawnee led by Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,23
Chris Traeger,Ben?,2,23
Ben Wyatt,I don't think that's a great idea.,2,23
Chris Traeger,Let's do it!,2,23
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Chris is the most positive state budget auditing consultant I have ever met.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun.",2,23
Chris Traeger,"People, we are here from the state budget office from Indianapolis.",2,23
Chris Traeger,Ooh.,2,23
Chris Traeger,What does that mean?,2,23
Chris Traeger,"Look, simply we are here to tinker with your budget.",2,23
Chris Traeger,Think of the government as a broken down carousel.,2,23
Chris Traeger,"We're going to slap on a new coat of paint, we are going to fix that broken speaker system, and we are going to get those happy kids back up on the horses where they belong!",2,23
Chris Traeger,Okay?,2,23
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,23
Chris Traeger,Okay?,2,23
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,23
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, that's not bad.",2,23
Chris Traeger,There it is.,2,23
Chris Traeger,"My partner, Ben, is going to stick around for a little bit, and I will see you all later.",2,23
Chris Traeger,Adios!,2,23
Ben Wyatt,Do you have a second?,2,23
Leslie Knope,I really like your shirt.,2,23
Ben Wyatt,So I'd like to talk about where you think there's waste within your department.,2,23
Ron Swanson,Where do I start?,2,23
Leslie Knope,There is none.,2,23
Ron Swanson,What exactly will you be cutting?,2,23
Ron Swanson,And how much of it?,2,23
Ron Swanson,And can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?,2,23
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's start with personnel.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,What can you tell me about Jerry Gergich?,2,23
Leslie Knope,He is one of the best people on the planet.,2,23
Leslie Knope,He's universally adored here.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"If you fired him, there would be a revolt.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you need to understand that just to keep this town afloat, we probably have to cut the budget of every department by 40 or 50%.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,Okay?,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, he said that because that sounds a lot better than ""We're going to gut it with a machete.""",2,23
Ben Wyatt,Okay?,2,23
Leslie Knope,You're a jerk.,2,23
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?,2,23
Ron Swanson,Easy.,2,23
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,This building has feelings?,2,23
Leslie Knope,Maybe.,2,23
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of history in this one.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Maybe it does.,2,23
Leslie Knope,How can you be so blase about this?,2,23
Ben Wyatt,"Because I didn't cause these problems, Ms. Knope.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,Your government did.,2,23
Ben Wyatt,I'll get what I need from the spreadsheets.,2,23
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.,2,23
Ron Swanson,What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?,2,23
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio.,2,23
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Looking hot, Big T.",2,23
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Throw them bows-- What?,2,23
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Damn, girl, who are you trying to impress?",2,23

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.,2,23
Donna Meagle,Got you a birthday shot.,2,23
April Ludgate,"Thanks, but now that it's legal, I've kind of lost interest.",2,23
Donna Meagle,Suit yourself.,2,23
Ann Perkins,I guess our awesome new park is on hold.,2,23
Ann Perkins,You have any idea what they're going to cut?,2,23
Leslie Knope,Nope.,2,23
Ann Perkins,You know what? You shouldn't wait around.,2,23
Ann Perkins,You should come up with your own budget plan and just control your own destiny.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I just don't know if I can play God like that-- an angry vengeful God who just fires Jerry for no reason.",2,23
Ann Perkins,You'd fire Jerry?,2,23
Leslie Knope,Not necessarily.,2,23
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,2,23
Leslie Knope,It's just been a really crappy day.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Where were you earlier when I called?,2,23

Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, listen to me. Listen to me, Ann.",2,23

Ann Perkins,It is so awesome. You are so awesome. I love you.,2,23

Ann Perkins,I loved Andy.,2,23
Ann Perkins,Loved him.,2,23

Leslie Knope,"Plus, I just talked to everybody in this bar, and nobody wants you here.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,That must have taken awhile.,2,23
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it did. You're a cold, callous person, and you want to kill people with machetes.",2,23

Leslie Knope,"He's cold and unfeeling, and I yelled at him. So what?",2,23

Lucy,Was it your bachelorette party?,2,23
Tom Haverford,"No, I invited a bunch of girls here last night, and they all put drinks on my tab.",2,23
Tom Haverford,And then I went home alone.,2,23
Tom Haverford,I'm not sure what happened.,2,23
Lucy,"You invited a bunch of girls here, and then you tried to hit on all of them.",2,23
Tom Haverford,Fair enough.,2,23
Lucy,"I mean, what were you expecting was gonna happen, a 43-way?",2,23
Tom Haverford,That would have been a little out of control.,2,23
Lucy,But awesome.,2,23
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, the problem is I only have 15 penises, so There would have been 28 girls that were really upset with me.",2,23
Lucy,Yeah.,2,23
Tom Haverford,"All right, well, thanks.",2,23
Tom Haverford,"Hey, would you wanna get a drink tomorrow night?",2,23

Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Shauna, look, I think you are a super cute person, and your newspaper articles are so cool, and they're probably very accurate.",2,23
Andy Dwyer,But I don't think we should go out romantically.,2,23
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why not?,2,23
Andy Dwyer,"Well, honestly, because there's already a girl that I like.",2,23

Leslie Knope,But I don't think you know anything about my department.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Have you ever been part of a government body before?,2,23
Ben Wyatt,"I have, yeah.",2,23

Ben Wyatt,I am.,2,23
Ben Wyatt,"When I was 18, I ran for mayor of my small town.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,And won.,2,23

Leslie Knope,"God, I was so jealous of you.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,You shouldn't have been.,2,23
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it ended up kind of ruining my life.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,"And now, I'm balancing budgets so I can show people I'm responsible.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,"So I can run for office again someday and not be laughed at, you know.",2,23
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you want to run for office someday, right?",2,23
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,23
Leslie Knope,How did you know?,2,23
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you have to be able to make decisions like this, Leslie.",2,23

Leslie Knope,"And it contains very practical, deep cuts in many of our services.",2,23
Chris Traeger,"Wow, Leslie.",2,23
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.,2,23
Chris Traeger,But it's moot.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Why?,2,23
Chris Traeger,Our investigation has revealed that things in Pawnee are much worse than we anticipated.,2,23
Leslie Knope,Meaning what?,2,23
Ben Wyatt,"Well, effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice.",2,23

Leslie Knope,I just started hearing really loud circus music in my head.,2,23

Ann Perkins,So I need to stay away from Chris.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this government shutdown.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this budget crisis.,2,24
Leslie Knope,But what I can't stand is they're canceling Freddy Spaghetti.,2,24
Leslie Knope,You know everything.,2,24
Leslie Knope,What should I do about this?,2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, Leslie.",2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,Why don't you see a movie or go shopping?,2,24
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.,2,24
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?,2,24
Leslie Knope,What's happening?,2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, they offered me a buyout, and I took it.",2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,"And so now, I work for Norton Construction.",2,24
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I know I shouldn't have done that.,2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,It's okay.,2,24
Leslie Knope,How could you quit?,2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, not everyone has your enthusiasm for this work.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"You know, I guess I've been mispronouncing your name all these years.",2,24
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanaquitz.,2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,"Recently, I had been thinking about maybe leaving this job.",2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,But I felt like I needed a sign.,2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,"And then Ann broke up with me the week that I was going to propose, the government got shut down, and yesterday one of those pigeons took a [bleep] on me.",2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,And I was indoors.,2,24
Mark Brendanawicz,Soâ¦,2,24
Tom Haverford,What are you doing here?,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Hey, sorry.",2,24
Leslie Knope,I need your help.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Is this a bad time?,2,24
Tom Haverford,Lucy is here.,2,24
Tom Haverford,I'm in my sexy pajamas.,2,24
Tom Haverford,I just took four Benadryls to dull my sensitivity.,2,24
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it is a bad time.",2,24
Leslie Knope,You're about to have sex.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Why else would Boyz II Men's On Bended Knee be playing right now?,2,24
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"I just want to give you a little advice, which is don't make it last really long.",2,24
Leslie Knope,Ladies don't like that.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Okay.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Great.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Okay?,2,24
Leslie Knope,Wait.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Just one more thing.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Are you using protection?,2,24
Ann Perkins,You know what?,2,24
Ann Perkins,I'm just going to stay away from all guys right now.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Less man time, more Ann time.",2,24
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Everyone needs a friend they can call and wake up in the middle of the night. Leslie's usually already up.,2,24
Ann Perkins,"And often, she's already on her way over.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"The only guy that I care about right now is six feet tall with wild, crazy hair and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun.",2,24
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Oh.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.,2,24
Leslie Knope,You know what is?,2,24
Leslie Knope,Sewage.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's kids are less important than poop tubes.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what are you going to do?",2,24
Leslie Knope,That's the way it is.,2,24
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",2,24
Ann Perkins,"If all the parks are closed, why not just have the concert in the lot behind my house?",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you devious bastard.",2,24
Freddy Spaghetti,"Well, the cow goes ""moo"" and the pig goes ""oink""",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've spent the last three hours coming up with a plan.",2,24
Leslie Knope,And I sent up the Bat Signal for all the people in the Parks Department to come and join us.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I told them to be here by 8:00.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Do you think anybody is going to show up?,2,24
Leslie Knope,"A, yes.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"B, even if they don't, we'll just put the concert on ourselves.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"But C, yes.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Yes, they're definitely going to show up.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Although, D, maybe not.",2,24
Ann Perkins,I think that you need to prepare for the eventuality that no one--,2,24
Jerry Gergich,Hello?,2,24
Jerry Gergich,Hello?,2,24
Leslie Knope,"God bless you, Jerry Gergich!",2,24
Jerry Gergich,Wow.,2,24
Jerry Gergich,I never thought I'd hear those words from you.,2,24
April Ludgate,Hey.,2,24
Leslie Knope,April is here.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Move, Jerry.",2,24
Leslie Knope,April.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I didn't think you were going to help.,2,24
April Ludgate,I still might not.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, how do you feel about lifting heavy things?",2,24
Jerry Gergich,My doctor just said I should avoid--,2,24
Leslie Knope,Being a wuss?,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"So, go out there and get the equipment out of the truck.",2,24
Leslie Knope,You're here.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Ann?,2,24
Leslie Knope,Can you make us some more pancakes?,2,24
April Ludgate,"Yes, Ann, I want pancakes.",2,24
Ann Perkins,"Uh, okay.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,"With current and projected deficits, we need to cut expenditures by 32%.",2,24
Ron Swanson,Let's make it an even 40.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,That's not necessary.,2,24
Ron Swanson,Slash it.,2,24
Ron Swanson,Slash it.,2,24
Florence,"Ron, a lot of people are going to get fired. Do you mind trying not to gloat?",2,24
Florence,"Yes, I do, Florence. I do mind that.",2,24
Ron Swanson,I'm very excited about this. I made pennants.,2,24
Ron Swanson,I am an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget.,2,24
Ron Swanson,Just saying that gave me a semi.,2,24
Ron Swanson,"Right off the bat, we sell City Hall.",2,24
Ron Swanson,Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a T.J. Maxx.,2,24
Chris Traeger,"Ron, that is a very creative idea.",2,24
Chris Traeger,"But we don't want to sell any of our major assets, because we don't want to lose out on any future revenue streams.",2,24
Ron Swanson,I hear that.,2,24
Ron Swanson,Don't worry.,2,24
Ron Swanson,I have tons more ideas.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, uh--",2,24
Ron Swanson,So sorry.,2,24
Ron Swanson,New ring tone.,2,24
Ron Swanson,Don't cut anything without me.,2,24
Ron Swanson,Leslie?,2,24
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you hate what we do.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I love it enough for both of us.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put on the Freddy Spaghetti concert today, 5:00 on Lot 48.",2,24
Ron Swanson,You can't do that.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Watch me.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"We're going to do this, Ron.",2,24
Leslie Knope,With or without you.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Hammering away.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Crank it.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Hit it.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Needs 16 minutes for premium bounce.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, after this, can you go pick up Freddy Spaghetti in your Mercedes?",2,24
Leslie Knope,We need to give him the star treatment.,2,24
Donna Meagle,He'd better be showered.,2,24
Donna Meagle,"I just detailed my car, and he is notoriously funky.",2,24
Tom Haverford,Hey.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Sorry we're late.,2,24
Tom Haverford,I had to wait on my girlfriend to finish eating breakfast.,2,24
Lucy,Hi.,2,24
Lucy,I'm Lucy.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Hi.,2,24
Lucy,Hey.,2,24
Tom Haverford,We had dinner last night and breakfast this morning.,2,24
Tom Haverford,What were we doing in between?,2,24
Tom Haverford,Sex stuff.,2,24
Lucy,"You guys know Tom really well, so I don't have to apologize for his behavior, right?",2,24
Leslie Knope,Right.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"We're so glad you're here, thanks for coming.",2,24
Lucy,"Thanks, it's gonna be fun.",2,24
Leslie Knope,We're gonna put on a show today.,2,24
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna make all the problems in our town go away.,2,24
Leslie Knope,But it is gonna make a lot of people happy.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Everybody ready?,2,24
Leslie Knope,Yes.,2,24
All,Yeah!,2,24
Leslie Knope,"All right, so-- Oh I forgot.",2,24
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a chance to get porta-potties so the audience are gonna have to use Ann's house for the bathrooms.,2,24
Ann Perkins,"Wait, aren't we expecting like 300 people?",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Hopefully! Okay, back to work!",2,24
Andy Dwyer,"The craziest thing is it's, like, super loud.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,You know what I mean?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"I was on it for only five minutes, and I can't really hear anything.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,Am I talking loud right now?,2,24
Lucy,Yeah.,2,24
Tom Haverford,And you know how to ride a motorcycle?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's just like driving half a car.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,April!,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Hey!,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Excuse me.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,I called you a gajillion times.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Why didn't you call me back?,2,24
April Ludgate,I'm so sorry.,2,24
April Ludgate,I was too busy not wanting to talk to you.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Huh?,2,24
April Ludgate,"Jerry, what are you doing?",2,24
Jerry Gergich,Leslie asked me to post these around the neighborhood.,2,24
April Ludgate,I'll do it.,2,24
Jerry Gergich,Really?,2,24
Jerry Gergich,Wow.,2,24
April Ludgate,Yes.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,You want some help with that?,2,24
Tom Haverford,"So, I heard about you and Chris.",2,24
Tom Haverford,Nice.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Nothing's gonna happen there.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Why not? You're a free agent.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Unlike me.,2,24
Ann Perkins,"Well, I make some bad decisions sometimes at the end of long relationships.",2,24
Ann Perkins,I think I'm just gonna cool it for a while.,2,24
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.,2,24
Tom Haverford,You don't need to jump into anything.,2,24
Tom Haverford,A girl like you can have whatever guy she wants.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Shut up.,2,24
Tom Haverford,"I'm serious Ann. I might joke about how nice your booty is, but I think you're a really nice person, and I think any guy would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend.",2,24
Ann Perkins,Listen to you. I like Tom with a girlfriend.,2,24
Ann Perkins,He's really sweet.,2,24
Tom Haverford,How much do you like him? Because I could definitely talk to Lucy about a three way situation.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Unbelievable.,2,24
Tom Haverford,I'm kidding.,2,24
Tom Haverford,But serious at the same time.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's talk about Parks and Rec.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,This one is a little complicated.,2,24
Chris Traeger,I know what will loosen up our brains.,2,24
Chris Traeger,Massage train.,2,24
Chris Traeger,And I know what you're thinking.,2,24
Chris Traeger,It's not that I want a massage.,2,24
Chris Traeger,I'll be the caboose.,2,24
Chris Traeger,And Ron Swanson is the locomotive.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,"And thanks to Ron, the services budget has already been cut significantly.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,"So, seems like the best option is job cuts.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,Starting with Leslie Knope.,2,24
Ron Swanson,"No, no, no, no, no.",2,24
Ron Swanson,"If you fire Leslie, you might as well just get rid of the department.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know how valuable she is, believe me.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,But we've run out of options.,2,24
Ron Swanson,There are plenty of other options.,2,24
Ron Swanson,"For example, sell the zoo animals.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,To whom?,2,24
Ron Swanson,Cosmetics labs?,2,24
Ron Swanson,Weird restaurants?,2,24
Ron Swanson,I'm just spitballing here.,2,24
Chris Traeger,"Okay, let's switch it up.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Look, she makes the second highest salary in the department.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,It will go a long way.,2,24
Ron Swanson,I'm telling you.,2,24
Ron Swanson,It's just not an option.,2,24
Chris Traeger,"Ron, focus up, buddy.",2,24
Ron Swanson,Just give me a sec.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Will you just stop and listen to me?,2,24
April Ludgate,No.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Fine.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"I don't want to talk to you, anyways.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,Reverse psychiatry.,2,24
April Ludgate,Fine.,2,24
April Ludgate,What?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,I like you.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"In a, you know, romantical kind of way.",2,24
April Ludgate,You do?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Yes.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Do you like me?,2,24
April Ludgate,Yes.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"So, then perhaps, shall we go out this evening?",2,24
April Ludgate,No.,2,24
April Ludgate,I don't think we should see each other.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Because you're 21 and I'm 29?,2,24
April Ludgate,No.,2,24
April Ludgate,I don't care about that.,2,24
April Ludgate,"It's because whenever I see you talk to Ann or talk about Ann, I feel like you still have feelings for her.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,What?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"No, I don't.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,But I don't.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"Really, I don't.",2,24
April Ludgate,"Well, I think you do.",2,24
April Ludgate,So... That's a problem for me.,2,24
Ron Swanson,"Because of my libertarian beliefs, Leslie does 95% of the work.",2,24
Ron Swanson,So you should lay me off.,2,24
Ron Swanson,I'd be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,It's precisely because of your beliefs that we need to keep you.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,You would maintain fiscal responsibility after we're gone.,2,24
Ron Swanson,I strenuously object.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Ron, we're moving on.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,Every department is losing a Leslie Knope.,2,24
Ron Swanson,"No, Ben, they are not.",2,24
Ron Swanson,No other department has one to begin with.,2,24
Ron Swanson,"Right now, she's singlehandedly putting up some lousy concert for this city's kids.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,She's doing what?,2,24
Chris Traeger,Could someone else massage my shoulders?,2,24
Ann Perkins,Wow.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Looking good.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish we had built one of those elevators that comes up from under the stage, you know?",2,24
Ron Swanson,They're coming!,2,24
Ann Perkins,Like a rock arena kind of thing?,2,24
Ron Swanson,They're coming!,2,24
Ann Perkins,What?,2,24
Ron Swanson,They're coming.,2,24
Leslie Knope,What's up?,2,24
Leslie Knope,What?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Who?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,The Russians?,2,24
Ron Swanson,"No, the state auditors.",2,24
Ron Swanson,I accidentally told them what you were doing in an attempt to save some government jobs.,2,24
Ron Swanson,It's been a very strange day for me.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, be cool.",2,24
Leslie Knope,Just be cool.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Hey!,2,24
Chris Traeger,Hey!,2,24
Chris Traeger,Hey!,2,24
Chris Traeger,Hey!,2,24
Chris Traeger,All right.,2,24

Chris Traeger,Everybody!,2,24
Chris Traeger,Hey.,2,24
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.,2,24
Chris Traeger,Hi.,2,24
Ann Perkins,Hi.,2,24
Chris Traeger,Everyone.,2,24
Chris Traeger,You are all super amazing.,2,24
Chris Traeger,"You are what makes Pawnee great, and I just want to tell you that I am totally supportive of your inspiring efforts here today!",2,24
Chris Traeger,"Now, my partner Ben wants to say something.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, we're shutting this down.",2,24
Jerry Gergich,What?,2,24
Chris Traeger,Damn!,2,24
Chris Traeger,That's terrible news!,2,24
Chris Traeger,"Surely, there has to be a solution, Ben.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,No.,2,24
Chris Traeger,Ben says no.,2,24
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, everyone.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,Chris and I used to slash budgets individually.,2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, when he would do it by himself, nothing got done, and when I did it by myself, I'd get death threats.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Together, it seems to work.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,"The concert is canceled, everybody.",2,24
Leslie Knope,No.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, though, Ben.",2,24
Leslie Knope,It's not canceled.,2,24
Leslie Knope,We're putting it on.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Okay?,2,24
Leslie Knope,Because the stage is already built.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Everything was donated for free by local vendors.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Everyone here believes that what we're doing is essential.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti will sing.,2,24
Donna Meagle,"Actually, Leslie, I just found out.",2,24
Donna Meagle,Freddy Spaghetti ain't coming.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.,2,24
Leslie Knope,But something much cooler is going to happen.,2,24
Leslie Knope,I think.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Ann?,2,24
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,2,24
Chris Traeger,Good job.,2,24
Chris Traeger,You should hydrate.,2,24
Donna Meagle,"When we canceled on him, he took another gig in Eagleton.",2,24
Donna Meagle,At a library.,2,24
Tom Haverford,That's literally the worst place I can imagine.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Okay.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Guys?,2,24
Leslie Knope,We're not giving up on this.,2,24
Leslie Knope,He's not the only musician in town.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Andy.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Leslie.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,I don't really feel like playing right now.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Andy, please.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,I don't even have children's songs.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,My last song I wrote was called Sex Hair.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Well, just take the word ""sex"" and change it to ""pickle.""",2,24
Andy Dwyer,Pickle?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"You got pickle hair, baby, And you got it from me",2,24
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Still sounds like it's about sex.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,I've got to grab my guitar from my house.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,I'll be back shortly!,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!,2,24
Leslie Knope,"See, guys?",2,24
Leslie Knope,We have a solution.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"And the good news is there's always a solution if your motives are pure, and your cause is just.",2,24
Leslie Knope,There's nothing--,2,24
Andy Dwyer,Ow!,2,24
Andy Dwyer,My arm!,2,24
Ann Perkins,"You have two broken bones in your right arm, and four in your hand.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,That's the side that hurts.,2,24
Leslie Knope,How soon until he's better?,2,24
Dr. Harris,"We'll set the fractures, and I'd like to keep him overnight for observation.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,Is there any chance you can fix me in the next 10 minutes?,2,24
Dr. Harris,"Sure, I'll just advance medical science 30 years.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,Great.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Can Mouse Rat play without you?,2,24
Andy Dwyer,They tried once.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"They're called Rat Mouse, and they're awful.",2,24
Andy Dwyer,But you have got to find somebody.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,There's an old saying in show business.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"""The show must go wrong.""",2,24
Andy Dwyer,"Everything always goes wrong, and you just have to deal with it.",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Pawnee.",2,24
Leslie Knope,I'm Renata Ricotta.,2,24
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti couldn't make it today.,2,24
Leslie Knope,He bumped his noodle.,2,24
Leslie Knope,There was sauce everywhere.,2,24
Leslie Knope,It was just streaming out of his face.,2,24
Leslie Knope,It was really scary.,2,24
Leslie Knope,All right.,2,24
Leslie Knope,"If you're happy and you know it, Clap your hands, If you're happy and you know itâ¦",2,24
Freddy Spaghetti,Clap your hands,2,24
Freddy Spaghetti,"Hey, kids!",2,24
Freddy Spaghetti,"It's me, Freddy Spaghetti!",2,24
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I thought you were playing in Eagleton.",2,24
Freddy Spaghetti,All I know is this guy showed up and made me a much better offer.,2,24
Freddy Spaghetti,"I am all about the money, babe.",2,24
Freddy Spaghetti,"She cooked an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot linguine, That she made for the first time that day",2,24
Ron Swanson,Thank you very much.,2,24
Tom Haverford,Ron Corleone.,2,24

Ron Swanson,"Hello, Lucy.",2,24
Ron Swanson,Whoa!,2,24
Lucy,Hi.,2,24
Ron Swanson,Impressive handshake.,2,24
Lucy,Thanks.,2,24
Lucy,My father told me that a limp handshake was for weak men and Communists.,2,24
Lucy,He hated both.,2,24
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Tommy.",2,24
Tom Haverford,Is that bacon on your turkey leg?,2,24
Ron Swanson,They call it a Swanson.,2,24
Lucy,Wow.,2,24

Ann Perkins,"Dude, that's what my whole week has been like.",2,24
Ann Perkins,My life is a motorcycle crash right now.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no.",2,24
Ann Perkins,Injured Andy.,2,24
Ann Perkins,"It's kind of like old times, huh?",2,24
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,2,24
Ann Perkins,I almost expect you to call me A-Cakes.,2,24
Andy Dwyer,A- Cakes.,2,24
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad you're okay.",2,24
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",2,24
Ann Perkins,I'm... I'm so sorry.,2,24

Ben Wyatt,Is that what you guys call me?,2,24
Leslie Knope,"No. No, no, no.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,Mean Ben?,2,24
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this is really great today, but there's going to be a lot of pain ahead, Leslie.",2,24
Ben Wyatt,We have to cut 32% of the--,2,24
Leslie Knope,"Just... Can you just stop it? Okay? Just for one moment, enjoy the fact that you provided a service for people, not a cut.",2,24
Leslie Knope,A service.,2,24

Andy Dwyer,Andy!,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Yes!,3,1
Andy Dwyer,I dedicate this victory to April Ludgate.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,It feels good.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,And it feels sticky.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,From the Gatorade.,3,1
Leslie Knope,We're barely able to function.,3,1
Leslie Knope,We could really use that money.,3,1
Chris Traeger,"Well, you know, I don't know if it's because I'm in such a good mood or because of the charming Ann Perkins, but I am going to seriously consider that.",3,1
Leslie Knope,Really?,3,1
Leslie Knope,That's great.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Mission accomplished.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Let's boogie.,3,1
Chris Traeger,Mission accomplished?,3,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah. There's a mission that Ann had thought of.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's.",3,1
Leslie Knope,We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"So, then, you could talk about the money, and then, you know, maybe give it to me.",3,1
Chris Traeger,Wow.,3,1
Chris Traeger,I've just had my first bad date.,3,1
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.,3,1
Ben Wyatt,Not that sneaky.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"April! April! Where have you been? Oh, my God.",3,1
April Ludgate,Hey.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,How are you?,3,1
April Ludgate,I'm okay.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,I'm dying to see you.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"I called and I texted you, like, a billion times.",3,1
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.,3,1
April Ludgate,I was in Venezuela.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Really? Wow.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Across the pond.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Wow.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,I thought maybe I would have heard from you at least once.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Because of what happened.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Ann kissing me? I am so sorry about that.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,It was so stupid and it meant nothing.,3,1
April Ludgate,I wouldn't worry about it.,3,1
April Ludgate,It's totally fine.,3,1
April Ludgate,Hey.,3,1
April Ludgate,"This is my boyfriend, Eduardo.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's not.",3,1
April Ludgate,That means we're going to lunch.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"How do you say, ""Have a great time, don't choke on anything""?",3,1
April Ludgate,Bye.,3,1
Ann Perkins,Leslie asked me to do her a favor.,3,1
Ann Perkins,"And I love her, so I did it.",3,1
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, and I'm here to eat crow.",3,1
Ann Perkins,I like you a lot.,3,1
Ann Perkins,Let's go out again.,3,1
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Budget solution number 28.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Note.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I got my answer.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,About April.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,She hates me.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"And she got a boyfriend, I guess.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,From some city in Mexico.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,So what do I do?,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay. Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just... You... You swing the hardest, damn it.",3,1
Leslie Knope,You go big or you go home.,3,1
Leslie Knope,And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,I'm not.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,I don't even really have a home.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Go get her, Andy.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,"Okay! Okay, thanks, Leslie.",3,1
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us.",3,1
Leslie Knope,My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.,3,1
Leslie Knope,And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.,3,1
April Ludgate,Check your testicles?,3,1
Leslie Knope,No. Not that.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Although that is very good advice.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Looking at you, Jerry.",3,1
Leslie Knope,No.,3,1
Leslie Knope,What's going to save us is right there.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight.",3,1
Leslie Knope,"But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die.",3,1
Leslie Knope,And we refuse to let that happen.,3,1
Leslie Knope,Now.,3,1
Leslie Knope,This town was historically known for two things.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival.",3,1
Leslie Knope,People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps.",3,1
Leslie Knope,"We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts.",3,1
Leslie Knope,And I propose we bring the festival back.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back.",3,1
Leslie Knope,"And believe me, people will come.",3,1
Ben Wyatt,What if they don't?,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department.",3,1
Ben Wyatt,And you guys are all on board with this.,3,1
Ron Swanson,Aye.,3,1
Everyone,Yes.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Look, we're not just pencil pushers.",3,1
Leslie Knope,We are a reflection of the community.,3,1
Leslie Knope,And we believe that we can strengthen that community.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together.",3,1
Chris Traeger,"That, literally, is the most moving thing I've ever heard.",3,1
Chris Traeger,And a good idea.,3,1
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, all right.",3,1
Leslie Knope,Excellent! Great! Okay.,3,1
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, April.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,Do you like the flowers?,3,1
April Ludgate,What are you doing?,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"All due respect, Eduardo. You seem like a great guy.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,But I like April.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,And I'm coming after her with everything I've got.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"So, do you want to go out with me? No.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were going to say yes.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,But that's okay.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Because I'll be back tomorrow to ask you again.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,And again the next day.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,And the next day.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,Not Friday.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,I have to go visit my cousin.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,But I will be back after that to ask you again.,3,1
Eduardo,You should do it.,3,1
Eduardo,Follow your dream.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God.",3,1
Andy Dwyer,Really? That's awesome.,3,1
Andy Dwyer,I'll see you tomorrow.,3,1

Ann Perkins,There is a crazy flu going around.,3,2
Ann Perkins,"Lots of miserable, dehydrated people with high fevers and diarrhea.",3,2
Ann Perkins,"And one of those dehydrated, highfevered, miserable people is April.",3,2
Ann Perkins,Who hates me.,3,2
April Ludgate,I want another nurse.,3,2
Ann Perkins,"Well, there are none.",3,2
Ann Perkins,We're stretched pretty thin right now.,3,2
April Ludgate,"Then, I want a janitor.",3,2
April Ludgate,"They can do what you do, right?",3,2
Ann Perkins,Yep.,3,2
Ann Perkins,Nurses and janitors are totally interchangeable.,3,2
April Ludgate,Except no one dresses up like a janitor when they want to be slutty.,3,2
Ann Perkins,I get the sense that maybe you're angry at me for kissing Andy.,3,2
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not.",3,2
April Ludgate,What are you talking about?,3,2
Ann Perkins,That's crazy.,3,2
Ann Perkins,And that you think it might be fun to take it out on me.,3,2
Ann Perkins,Please don't do that.,3,2
April Ludgate,Do?,3,2
April Ludgate,I can't do anything.,3,2
April Ludgate,I'm sick.,3,2

Leslie Knope,"Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself.",3,2
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate.",3,2
Leslie Knope,And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.,3,2
Leslie Knope,"But, I'm just feeling really tired.",3,2
Leslie Knope,I think maybe my allergies are acting up.,3,2
Leslie Knope,"I've already vomited, like, five times today.",3,2
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce and we're going to go over all the details.,3,2
Leslie Knope,And we'd just love if you could come and join us.,3,2
JJ,Sure.,3,2
JJ,Anything for my favorite customer.,3,2
Leslie Knope,I bet you say that to all the girls.,3,2
JJ,"Oh, no.",3,2
JJ,"No, actually, you're my favorite.",3,2
JJ,"You spent over 1,000 dollars last year on waffles alone.",3,2
Ron Swanson,Here.,3,2
Ron Swanson,"I didn't know what to bring you, so I just got some magazines and lipstick.",3,2
Ron Swanson,Woman stuff.,3,2
April Ludgate,Thanks.,3,2
April Ludgate,All my parents got me was that.,3,2

April Ludgate,"If you see Andy, will you not tell him I'm here?",3,2
Ron Swanson,Okay.,3,2
April Ludgate,"Because of what happened, I don't want him to think--",3,2
Ron Swanson,Stop!,3,2
Ron Swanson,Don't want to know.,3,2
Ron Swanson,"The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am.",3,2
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in caring about people.,3,2
Ron Swanson,I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name.,3,2
Ron Swanson,Best friend I ever had.,3,2
Ron Swanson,We still never talk sometimes.,3,2
Leslie Knope,"So, we've developed a revenue sharing formula that will hopefully appeal to most business owners, but--",3,2
Tom Haverford,Leslie.,3,2
Tom Haverford,Go home.,3,2
Tom Haverford,You're sick.,3,2
Leslie Knope,I'm not sick.,3,2
Leslie Knope,It's just allergies.,3,2
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys.",3,2
Leslie Knope,Just let me in there.,3,2
Donna Meagle,No.,3,2
Jerry Gergich,You can't come in here.,3,2

Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you look tired and you're all sweaty.",3,2
Leslie Knope,You look tired and you're all sweaty all the time.,3,2
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?,3,2

Chris Traeger,I think the pavement in this town is soft.,3,2
Ann Perkins,What's with the mask?,3,2
Chris Traeger,Flu prevention.,3,2
Chris Traeger,"My body is finely tuned, like a microchip, and the flu is like a grain of sand.",3,2
Ann Perkins,It could literally shut down the entire system.,3,2
Ann Perkins,"My body's like a chip, too.",3,2
Ann Perkins,A potato chip.,3,2
Ann Perkins,No.,3,2
Chris Traeger,"Speaking of potato chips, you and I are on for dinner tomorrow, yes?",3,2

Ann Perkins,There was one time I thought he farted.,3,2
Ann Perkins,But it was me.,3,2
Ron Swanson,I need to find someone to fill in for April.,3,2
Ron Swanson,"Now, I know I'm not going to find someone who's both aggressively mean and apathetic.",3,2
Ron Swanson,April really is the whole package.,3,2
Ron Swanson,But I think I might know someone who will be just as ineffective.,3,2
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Andrew.",3,2
Ron Swanson,What's new?,3,2

Ben Wyatt,"Look, don't worry.",3,2
Ben Wyatt,"I've done presentations like this before, and Tom will be with me.",3,2
Ben Wyatt,"So, you're in good hands.",3,2
Leslie Knope,It's not that I don't trust Ben.,3,2
Leslie Knope,It's that I don't have faith in Ben.,3,2
Leslie Knope,"And, also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is.",3,2
Ben Wyatt,I'll handle the general outline.,3,2
Ben Wyatt,If you want to just jump right in.,3,2
Tom Haverford,Look.,3,2

Ben Wyatt,"No, we promised Leslie we'd prep for the meeting.",3,2
Tom Haverford,"No, Ben.",3,2
Tom Haverford,You promised Leslie.,3,2
Tom Haverford,"See, I never promise Leslie anything.",3,2

Ann Perkins,"Not like, ""Damn, you're fine,"" but fine healthwise.",3,2
Chris Traeger,My body has no fat to protect itself from disease.,3,2
Chris Traeger,Things happen very quickly.,3,2
Chris Traeger,Listen to me.,3,2
Chris Traeger,It's very important that you replenish my body with electrolytes after every involuntary loss of bodily fluids.,3,2

Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, Leslie Knope!",3,2

Leslie Knope,"By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival, and the monetary value of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure is, frankly, incalculable.",3,2

Ann Perkins,You want to hate me forever?,3,2
April Ludgate,Okay.,3,2

Donna Meagle,Yes.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?",3,3
Leslie Knope,All right.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst.",3,3
Kelly Larson,"You seem tense, Leslie.",3,3
Kelly Larson,You know what you should do?,3,3
Leslie Knope,Read Twilight?,3,3
Kelly Larson,Read Twilight.,3,3
Kelly Larson,Here.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks.",3,3
Tom Haverford,Sometimes I think she's in the Volturi.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Kelly.",3,3
Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Leslie.",3,3
Kelly Larson,"Hope you don't mind, I moved myself over to this pipe.",3,3
Kelly Larson,It's a little more comfortable.,3,3
Leslie Knope,No problem.,3,3
Leslie Knope,Did you have a nice night?,3,3
Leslie Knope,Sleep well?,3,3
Kelly Larson,"It was all right, considering.",3,3
Leslie Knope,Picked you up some coffee.,3,3
Kelly Larson,Thank you so much.,3,3
Kelly Larson,"Well, you seem pretty chipper this morning.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here.",3,3
Leslie Knope,You know what I did last night?,3,3
Kelly Larson,"Read Twilight, and it transformed your life and you're gonna put it in the time capsule?",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I read the first 10 pages.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't really get into it, though.",3,3
Leslie Knope,More of a Harry Potter girl myself.,3,3
Kelly Larson,What?,3,3
Leslie Knope,"But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?",3,3
Leslie Knope,Is that why you did this?,3,3
Leslie Knope,To impress your daughter?,3,3
Kelly Larson,"Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her.",3,3
Kelly Larson,She loves Twilight.,3,3
Kelly Larson,"So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero.",3,3
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.,3,3
Leslie Knope,You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.,3,3
Kelly Larson,I didn't want to drag her into it.,3,3
Kelly Larson,I'm sorry.,3,3
Kelly Larson,This is a mistake.,3,3
Kelly Larson,You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.,3,3
Leslie Knope,I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.,3,3
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, no.",3,3
Ron Swanson,We don't negotiate with weirdoes.,3,3
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what happened to, ""A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee""?",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I can get Shauna on board.",3,3
Leslie Knope,It would make a great human interest story.,3,3
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, that's a good point.",3,3
Leslie Knope,Then we shall bring the pipe to them.,3,3
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes.",3,3
Ben Wyatt,What does that mean?,3,3
Ron Swanson,Crackpot convention.,3,3
Leslie Knope,So that's what today's forum is for.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items.",3,3
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?,3,3
Extra,I think we should put in the Bible.,3,3
Leslie Knope,Great.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Eduardo.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Eduardo.",3,3
Andy Dwyer,I want to apologize.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Just because you're dating my soul mate doesn't give me any right to be a jerk to you.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,"I promise from now on, I'm just gonna be super nice to you.",3,3
Eduardo,Thank you for saying that.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,You're welcome.,3,3
Eduardo,What CDs are those?,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,My band.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,It's our latest album.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,You like music?,3,3
Andy Dwyer,What are you listening to?,3,3
Eduardo,The Smiths.,3,3
Eduardo,Very depressing!,3,3
Andy Dwyer,April's making you listen to that?,3,3
Eduardo,Mmm.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,She's really into that indie stuff.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,I'm more of a Dave Matthews guy myself.,3,3
Eduardo,David Matthews!,3,3
Eduardo,Crash into Me!,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Yes!,3,3
Andy Dwyer,I love that song.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, here.",3,3
Andy Dwyer,Take one.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Check us out.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,"We're amazing, so let me know how much you like us.",3,3
Eduardo,"Yeah, gracias.",3,3
Andy Dwyer,"That means ""thank you""?",3,3
Eduardo,Yes.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"So, we have one very moving case for Twilight.",3,3
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?,3,3
Leslie Knope,Great.,3,3
Leslie Knope,Two people for Twilight.,3,3
Marcia Langman,"Oh, no, no, no, no.",3,3
Marcia Langman,"I'm Marcia Langman, from the Society for Family Stability Foundation.",3,3
Marcia Langman,This book contains pagan creatures and strong sexual overtones.,3,3
Marcia Langman,There are girls quivering.,3,3
Marcia Langman,"There are boys staring deeply into girls' eyes as they quiver, and so forth.",3,3
Marcia Langman,There really is a tremendous amount of quivering.,3,3
Marcia Langman,"It is anti-Christian, it is pro-quivering, and the government has no business promoting it.",3,3
Extra,I totally disagree.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, now we have two people for Twilight.",3,3
Extra,Absolutely not.,3,3
Extra,I'm with the National Civil Liberties Association.,3,3
Extra,"That book actually contains overt Christian themes, and as such, has no business being associated with any government project.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"So too Christian, and not Christian enough?",3,3
Leslie Knope,Do you see the irony here?,3,3
Leslie Knope,No?,3,3
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight?",3,3
Kelly Larson,No!,3,3
Kelly Larson,You promised!,3,3
Marcia Langman,You promised?,3,3
Marcia Langman,That's not fair!,3,3
Extra,"Wait, it's not a question of fairness.",3,3
Marcia Langman,"Go back to Russia, commie!",3,3
Kelly Larson,"Hey, you go back to Russia! You go back to wherever you came from!",3,3
Marcia Langman,Why would I go to Russia? I have no interest in traveling to Russia. Can I just say that?,3,3
Leslie Knope,And who else?,3,3
Extra,"I would like to include my favorite book, Crazy from the Heat, the David Lee Roth story.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight.",3,3
Extra,I don't care about Twilight.,3,3
Extra,Why is this only about his favorite book? I want my favorite book in there.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea.",3,3
Leslie Knope,Two time capsules.,3,3
Leslie Knope,"One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight.",3,3
Marcia Langman,No Twilight!,3,3
Kelly Larson,"Yes, Twilight!",3,3
Tom Haverford,Hey.,3,3
Lucy,Hey.,3,3
Tom Haverford,Thanks for coming.,3,3
Lucy,I only have a second.,3,3
Lucy,I have to get to work.,3,3
Tom Haverford,Bella's going on her first hunt.,3,3
Tom Haverford,I just don't get why you broke up with me.,3,3
Tom Haverford,"Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough? Like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward Bella Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?",3,3
Lucy,Uh It's nothing to do with Twilight. It just didn't work out.,3,3
Tom Haverford,"Okay? Well, what difference does it make? If we stayed together, you probably would have just dumped me for Ron.",3,3
Lucy,"Actually, that's the reason.",3,3
Lucy,"I believe you when you say that you're not in love with Wendy anymore, but you're definitely not cool with her dating Ron.",3,3
Lucy,You talk about it constantly.,3,3
Tom Haverford,"Well, I can't help it, okay? I mean, he's so manly, and he's my boss.",3,3
Tom Haverford,"Imagine if your boss was Angelina Jolie, and then one day, she just started dating your ex-boyfriend.",3,3
Tom Haverford,Wouldn't that freak you out a little bit?,3,3
Lucy,"Well, not if I had a great new boyfriend, dumbass.",3,3
Lucy,"Look, Tom, I like you.",3,3
Lucy,"You're really cute and you're funny, and you're small enough for me to throw you around.",3,3
Lucy,"So if you ever work through this, then give me a call.",3,3
Extra,"My grandmother lived in Pawnee for 60 years, and I wanna put her ashes in the time capsule.",3,3
Chance Frenlm,"My cat, Turnip, was the greatest cat ever, and I'd like to put his ashes in the time capsule.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules.",3,3
Chance Frenlm,Except for Turnip! Except for Turnip!,3,3
Leslie Knope,No chanting.,3,3
Extra,"Look, we don't know what the world is going to be like in 50 years.",3,3
Extra,We could all have been wiped out from disease or the flu.,3,3
Leslie Knope,So what's your suggestion?,3,3
Extra,I don't know. I'm just scared.,3,3
April Ludgate,Hey.,3,3
Eduardo,Andy!,3,3
Andy Dwyer,"I got two microphones, a four-track recorder and every bass tab to Dave Matthews ever.",3,3
Andy Dwyer,"We're gonna jam for, like, nine hours.",3,3
Andy Dwyer,Is that cool?,3,3
Eduardo,Yeah.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,All right.,3,3
Gretel,That's ridiculous.,3,3
Gretel,"Now, why should the Bill of Rights be in the official time capsule, but this painting of my dog is in time capsule seven?",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think pet paintings/ ashes are in time capsule four.",3,3
Extra,"No, that's baseball cards.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia.",3,3
Kelly Larson,"Honestly, Twilight could go in almost any of these categories.",3,3
Extra,"Oh, shut up, Kelly!",3,3
Kelly Larson,"Make me, Bob!",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a 10-minute break! Oh, God.",3,3
Leslie Knope,This time capsule's tearing this town apart.,3,3
Leslie Knope,You're leaving soon.,3,3
Leslie Knope,Can I blame it on you in the press?,3,3
Ben Wyatt,Sure.,3,3
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I gotta say, I think it's kind of impressive.",3,3
Ben Wyatt,I've been to a lot of towns.,3,3
Ben Wyatt,Usually people don't care about anything.,3,3
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, don't get me wrong.",3,3
Ben Wyatt,"These people are weirdoes, but they're weirdoes who care.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now.",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Pawnee of the future, congratulations.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent what life was like in our town at that moment.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""Instead, you'll find only one item, a video recording of a public forum we held in order to determine just what those items would be.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""This is truly what life was like.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""A lot of people with a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""He had one job to do.""",3,3
Leslie Knope,"""Sincerely, Pawnee of the past.""",3,3
Andy Dwyer,Is Eduardo coming?,3,3
April Ludgate,"No, he went back to Venezuela.",3,3
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that sucks.",3,3
Andy Dwyer,He was a really good bassist.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,I was actually starting to like him.,3,3
April Ludgate,I know.,3,3
April Ludgate,That's what made me start to hate him.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Hey.,3,3
Andy Dwyer,Nice and band totally worked.,3,3
Ann Perkins,Have you enjoyed your time with Andy?,3,3
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, he's great.",3,3
Chris Traeger,And he told me how great you are.,3,3
Chris Traeger,And he told me that I would be crazy to let you get away.,3,3
Ann Perkins,"He did, huh?",3,3
Chris Traeger,He did.,3,3
Chris Traeger,"And also, there is a pretzel stand over there that serves, literally, the best pretzel I've ever had.",3,3
Chris Traeger,Would you like one?,3,3
Ann Perkins,Absolutely.,3,3
Tom Haverford,"Hey, guys.",3,3
Everyone,"Hey, Tom.",3,3
Leslie Knope,Tom.,3,3
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I've never seen this before, so I'd really appreciate it if no one, like, talked or texted or anything.",3,3
Tom Haverford,Okay.,3,3
Leslie Knope,Ooh! Hey.,3,3
Kelly Larson,"Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up.",3,3
Tom Haverford,"Dude, what did I just say?",3,3
Kelly Larson,"Hey, I was the guy who introduced you to--",3,3

Ron Swanson,"Right now, you're probably thinking, ""Tammy's changed.""",3,4

Chris Traeger,"Look, I get it.",3,4
Chris Traeger,"You're young, and trying isn't cool.",3,4
Chris Traeger,But I think you're smart.,3,4

Ann Perkins,So that's something.,3,4
Leslie Knope,I hope you're happy.,3,4
Tom Haverford,"Look, I just wanted to show him what it felt like to have your exwife date someone you know.",3,4

Ben Wyatt,Really?,3,4
Ben Wyatt,Just like that?,3,4
Chief Trumple,Leslie Knope gets as many favors as she needs.,3,4

Leslie Knope,I'll invite him out to dinner and I'll poke around a little bit.,3,6
Ann Perkins,Okay.,3,6
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not gonna be able to keep anything from me.",3,6
Leslie Knope,"In high school, they used to call me Angela Lansbury.",3,6
Leslie Knope,But that was because of my haircut.,3,6
Tom Haverford,"Hey, champ.",3,6
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, champion.",3,6
Tom Haverford,"Listen, you should come out tonight.",3,6
Tom Haverford,Club's gonna be dope.,3,6
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm pretty sure you have nothing else going on.",3,6

Ben Wyatt,The owner of the motel I'm staying at said she was gonna screen Hope Floats in the lobby.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,Asked me if I wanted to watch.,3,6
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,3,6

Leslie Knope,"If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's second largest rocking chair.",3,6
Ron Swanson,No.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Then maybe we should take a quick two hour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.,3,6
Leslie Knope,"It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home.",3,6
Ron Swanson,No.,3,6
Leslie Knope,"What's wrong with you, grouchy pants?",3,6
Ron Swanson,I've been fasting all day to save room for Mulligan's.,3,6
Leslie Knope,"Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron.",3,6
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to understand, we are heading for the most special place on earth.",3,6
Ron Swanson,"When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache, and I refuse to clean it because, every now and then, a piece of meat will fall into my mouth.",3,6

Leslie Knope,It's like a spa in here.,3,6
Chris Traeger,Exactly.,3,6
Chris Traeger,The entranceway to your house sends a message to the world about who you are.,3,6
Chris Traeger,And the front door provides energy flow and opportunity.,3,6
Chris Traeger,You cannot limit that.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Ron doesn't even have a front door.,3,6
Leslie Knope,He won't even tell me his address.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Ask him where he lives.,3,6
Chris Traeger,Where do you live?,3,6
Ron Swanson,Why?,3,6
Leslie Knope,So this is some kind of coat closet or something?,3,6
Leslie Knope,"Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here.",3,6

Ann Perkins,What the hell?,3,6
Leslie Knope,"You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something.",3,6
Ann Perkins,I don't I'm coming up there.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Wait.,3,6
Leslie Knope,"All right, okay.",3,6
Chris Traeger,"All right, let's go.",3,6
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God.",3,6

Leslie Knope,"Ron, stop it!",3,6
Leslie Knope,Ron?,3,6
Ron Swanson,They just boarded her up like she was some common warehouse.,3,6
Ron Swanson,I should have been here.,3,6

Tom Haverford,"Attack, Yearning, Thickening, Itch, Coma, Sideboob.",3,6
Ben Wyatt,"Dennis Feinstein, though?",3,6
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.,3,6
Tom Haverford,"Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee.",3,6
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,So what's your plan?,3,6
Tom Haverford,"Wait till he's alone, then I'll walk up and spray him with Tommy Fresh, and I say, "" Uh-oh.""",3,6
Tom Haverford,"""Looks like you just inhaled your future.""",3,6
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,That might actually work.,3,6
April Ludgate,Is everything okay?,3,6

Leslie Knope,"She's my best friend, and anyone who hurt her is someone I would murder, probably.",3,6
Chris Traeger,"Oh, is that what's upsetting you?",3,6
Chris Traeger,This is very uncomfortable for me.,3,6
Chris Traeger,I don't know what to say.,3,6
Tom Haverford,Watch the master work it.,3,6
Tom Haverford,I'm the Yoda of networking.,3,6

Tom Haverford,I don't know.,3,6
Tom Haverford,I haven't thought it through.,3,6
Tom Haverford,"But for now, I want to present Tommy Fresh.",3,6
Dennis Feinstein,"All right, I get it.",3,6
Dennis Feinstein,It's a gag scent.,3,6
Dennis Feinstein,Hilarious!,3,6

Andy Dwyer,We are like Robin Hood.,3,6
Andy Dwyer,We steal from the club and we give to ourselves.,3,6
Leslie Knope,"Look, we'll find a 24 hour diner.",3,6

Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, what are you doing here?",3,6
Ann Perkins,Whose pink razor's in your shower?,3,6
Chris Traeger,Excuse me?,3,6

Ann Perkins,Whose is it?,3,6
Chris Traeger,I guess you're talking about my razor.,3,6
Chris Traeger,"I shave my legs for swimming, and women's razors work better.",3,6
Chris Traeger,"For whatever reason, men's razor technology hasn't figured out how to properly contour the shinbone.",3,6

Chris Traeger,We talked at your house.,3,6
Chris Traeger,Do you not remember this?,3,6
Ann Perkins,"Of course I remember, but we didn't break up.",3,6
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, Ann, but I'm certain we did.",3,6
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you said that you didn't wanna leave Pawnee and that I was the most amazing woman you had ever met.",3,6
Chris Traeger,Which you are.,3,6
Ann Perkins,"And then I said that I would move to Indianapolis if I had to, and you said you didn't wanna make me do that, and then you said that in a different world... Oh, my God.",3,6
Ann Perkins,You broke up with me.,3,6
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",3,6
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so here's what happened.",3,6
Leslie Knope,"Sweet and beautiful Ann has never been dumped before, and Chris is such a positive person, when he broke up with her, she just didn't realize it.",3,6
Leslie Knope,It's kind of understandable.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Although it does kind of make you wonder how good of a nurse she is.,3,6
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",3,6
Ann Perkins,"You left, and you said you were gonna work late, and I kissed you?",3,6
Chris Traeger,"As enjoyable as that was, I did find it odd.",3,6

Ben Wyatt,A teriyaki hairpiece?,3,6
Tom Haverford,I smell like the guy who's always coming up short.,3,6
Tom Haverford,And you know what? I'm just sick of it.,3,6
Tom Haverford,Tommy Fresh was my dream.,3,6
Tom Haverford,Now no one's ever gonna smell it but me.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,"I can smell your dreams, Tom.",3,6

Leslie Knope,"And then the guy said he wasn't ""feeling it,"" so he left and I waited for an ambulance.",3,6
Leslie Knope,"One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again.",3,6
Leslie Knope,One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Skywriting isn't always positive.,3,6

Leslie Knope,"""Rebecca's coming.""",3,6
Leslie Knope,And then he broke up with me.,3,6
Ann Perkins,Who was Rebecca?,3,6
Leslie Knope,Yeah. Exactly.,3,6
Ann Perkins,Thanks for driving me.,3,6
Ann Perkins,Wait.,3,6
Ann Perkins,You're getting your commendation tomorrow at the Statehouse.,3,6

Ann Perkins,Leslie.,3,6
Leslie Knope,"Besides, Ron is staying behind.",3,6
Leslie Knope,He'll go.,3,6
Ann Perkins,Is Ron gonna be okay?,3,6
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know.,3,6
Ron Swanson,This isn't a steak.,3,6
Ron Swanson,Why would you call it that on your menu?,3,6
Extra,"I don't know what to tell you, man.",3,6
Ron Swanson,Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have.,3,6
Ron Swanson,"Wait, wait.",3,6
Ron Swanson,"I worry what you just heard was, ""Give me a lot of bacon and eggs.""",3,6
Ron Swanson,"What I said was, ""Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.""",3,6
Ron Swanson,Do you understand?,3,6
Tom Haverford,It's called a Tommytini.,3,6
Tom Haverford,It's just vodka and a bunch of cinnamon.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,That sounds gross.,3,6
Donna Meagle,Ben.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, Miller Lite.",3,6
Ben Wyatt,How'd you know?,3,6
Tom Haverford,Everybody knows.,3,6
Tom Haverford,That's your drink.,3,6
Donna Meagle,Tommy.,3,6
Tom Haverford,Let's do this.,3,6

Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's socializing!",3,6
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, and I'm having a good time.",3,6
Leslie Knope,Sit with us.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,6
Leslie Knope,Ann's in kind of a crappy mood because Chris dumped her.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, like a week ago, right?",3,6
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but I only knew about it an hour ago.",3,6
Ben Wyatt,So that's why you tried to kiss him.,3,6
Ben Wyatt,We were all seriously confused about that.,3,6
Ann Perkins,"Who's ""we""? What are you-- Oh, God.",3,6
April Ludgate,Did you keep the toilet paper?,3,6
Andy Dwyer,Yes.,3,6
Andy Dwyer,"I feel bad, but I need it.",3,6

Leslie Knope,"And if it fails, the Parks Department will be eliminated.",3,7
Leslie Knope,That's why we're going big.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Seven days, over 30 different locations, 50,000 plus visitors and four hospitality kiosks.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"God, I've got to stop ending on that boring thing.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Clowns.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"No you cannot sell home-brewed water, and no I would not like to taste it.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"April, who's next?",3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Man, you are just knocking these off.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,You're like a ninja crossed with a Jedi or something.,3,7
Tom Haverford,You're like a nerd mixed with a dork or something.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, Star Wars is not that nerdy.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"No, Star Wars is not that nerdy.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,It's not.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,Everyone has seen it.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Everyone has seen it.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,Everyone.,3,7
April Ludgate,This guy's here.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ken.",3,7
Ken Hotate,"Hi, Leslie.",3,7
Leslie Knope,This is Ben and Tom.,3,7
Tom Haverford,That's a dope bolo.,3,7
Leslie Knope,This is Ken Hotate.,3,7
Leslie Knope,He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"I just said, hello honored guest. Although literally translated it means may you be blessed with a million possums.",3,7
Leslie Knope,The Wamapoke used to use possums as currency.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I know why you're here.",3,7
Leslie Knope,And just let me say that we really tried.,3,7
Ken Hotate,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one.",3,7
Ken Hotate,I'm under a lot of pressure.,3,7
Ken Hotate,I'm going to need to formally ask you to move the carnival.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?,3,7
Leslie Knope,"The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons.",3,7
Ken Hotate,"During the battle, 93 year old chief was shot one hundred and two times by the cavalry.",3,7
Tom Haverford,Did he die?,3,7
Leslie Knope,Yes.,3,7
Ken Hotate,And this moment will be commemorated for the next seven days with shooting galleries and fried dough stands.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive.",3,7
Leslie Knope,This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.,3,7
Leslie Knope,The atrocities are in blue.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent.",3,7
Ken Hotate,"I completely understand you, but this is sacred burial ground.",3,7
Ken Hotate,And I just hope that the souls of my ancestors don't put a curse on this festival.,3,7
Ken Hotate,There are two things I know about white people.,3,7
Ken Hotate,"They love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,Hey.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Hey.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"So, somebody, I don't want to say who, it was totally me, got Sweetums to donate another fifteen cotton candy machines.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Ow, ow, ow!",3,7
Ben Wyatt,Right in the chest.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,Bazooka.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, get a room.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so guys, focus up.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last minute walkthrough of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"So, everything needs to be perfect.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Joan is always looking for a scandal.,3,7
Leslie Knope,She's like an eagleeyed tiger.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Eagle Eyed Tiger.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,New band name.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,I call it.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, gather around.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Let's grab hands.,3,7
Ron Swanson,I don't hold hands.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"You're all amazing, wonderful people.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,That's not inspiring.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Let's go get them, everybody.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Any concerns, address them to Ron.",3,7
Ron Swanson,"The advantages to being Leslie's boss is that she does everything herself, and there are never any problems.",3,7
Ron Swanson,"Which means for the next week, I can sit in this lawn chair, and read this book about old boats. Excuse me, I have to get back to work.",3,7
Donna Meagle,"Hey, whatever happened to you and the Bionic Man?",3,7
Ann Perkins,Chris?,3,7
Ann Perkins,"He broke up with me, but he did it so nicely that I didn't even realize he did it.",3,7
Donna Meagle,I've done that to multiple men.,3,7
Donna Meagle,How are you doing?,3,7
Donna Meagle,Are you doing okay?,3,7
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for asking.,3,7
Ann Perkins,It's been tough.,3,7
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,3,7
Ann Perkins,"Two days ago, I was sobbing at a pizza buffet, and they asked me to leave.",3,7
Ann Perkins,I've been looking at some dog adoption websites.,3,7
Ann Perkins,Bought 700 dollars worth of candles from Anthropologie.,3,7
Ann Perkins,I did this to my hair.,3,7
Ann Perkins,"You know, your basic bottoming out kind of stuff.",3,7
Donna Meagle,Yeah.,3,7
Donna Meagle,"Normally, people tell you to talk about your problems.",3,7
Donna Meagle,I'm going to recommend you bottle that noise up.,3,7
Ann Perkins,That's what my mailman said.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Murder.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Murder the most melons.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Shaquille showered.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Shame on Shakira's sheets.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Joan.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"Hello, Leslie.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Looks like a very impressive festival.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,But we'll see.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,We'll see.,3,7
Leslie Knope,You remember Ben.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,It's nice to see you again.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival.",3,7
Leslie Knope,And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Wow.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn?,3,7
Leslie Knope,Pawnee corn.,3,7
Leslie Knope,And it's organic.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"Beautiful, but deadly.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,When was the last time this giant wheel of death was inspected?,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, twice in the last week, and everything is 100% up to code.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,How many of these carnies are illegals?,3,7
Leslie Knope,None.,3,7
Leslie Knope,They're all U.S citizens.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's Aunt Tilda will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,You got Tilda?,3,7
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,3,7
Leslie Knope,We got Tilda.,3,7
Leslie Knope,But the real coup is over there.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Are you [bleep] kidding me?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,You got Little Sebastian?,3,7
Leslie Knope,See for yourself.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Wow.,3,7
Leslie Knope,He is so adorable.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"Thank you, Joan.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"And Little Sebastian isn't bad, either!",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Tom!,3,7
Tom Haverford,How are you?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Good.,3,7
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.,3,7
Tom Haverford,Hold on a second.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,What?,3,7
Tom Haverford,Did you get your breasts done?,3,7
Tom Haverford,You look amazing.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, thanks for noticing.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"Joan, listen to me.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"This Harvest Festival, it's going to knock your socks off.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"And when it does, I'm going to be there to give you a foot massage.",3,7
Tom Haverford,To completion.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,I swear.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,It's almost like they don't want you to win.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you better practice.",3,7
April Ludgate,You've got to win me a teddy bear.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to win you a million teddy bears.,3,7
April Ludgate,"Well, I want a billion teddy bears.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's a little unrealistic.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,This is a hard game.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Two million.,3,7
April Ludgate,Deal.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,All right.,3,7
April Ludgate,"Hey, I love you.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, shut up!",3,7
Andy Dwyer,That is awesome sauce.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,You're such a good boy.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, stop bothering Little Sebastian.",3,7
Tom Haverford,Leslie said I should watch him for a little bit.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,Perfect.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,I've got to go get him a tail scrunchie.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"Hi Little Sebastian, how's it going?",3,7
Tom Haverford,"Pretty good, just eating some hay, hanging out. What's your name?",3,7
Tom Haverford,My name's Tom. Oh you're really well-dressed.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"I like how you have your t-shirt over your dress shirt, you look way cooler than everybody else here.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"Little Sebastian come on, you're making me blush.",3,7
Tom Haverford,Most people look at Little Sebastian and they see a famous minihorse.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"I see an advertising opportunity for my club, the Snakehole Lounge.",3,7
Tom Haverford,Wow.,3,7
Tom Haverford,That is a shockingly huge minihorse erection.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"I don't think I'm being unprofessional, I was really hoping for more tawdry scandals.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"What about your friend Ben, here?",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,We all know his story.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"One of failure, remind us of that failure.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you know, when I was an 18 year old mayor, I tried to build a winter sports complex called Ice Town, and it bankrupted the city.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Yikes.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,I was also shortstop of my J.V baseball team.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,No one ever brings that up.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"And now, you're involved with this.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"Do I smell another disaster, hopefully?",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Not even I could screw that up.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"I'm a reporter, not your therapist.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"So, anytime someone takes a picture of him, the Snakehole's logo is in it.",3,7
Tom Haverford,Am I a genius or what?,3,7
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Tom.",3,7
Jerry Gergich,Where's Little Sebastian?,3,7
Tom Haverford,"Somebody left the gate open and he got out, Jerry.",3,7
Jerry Gergich,What?,3,7
Jerry Gergich,What are you talking about?,3,7
Tom Haverford,Unbelievable.,3,7
Tom Haverford,Another in a long string of miserable failures.,3,7
Tom Haverford,You lost Little Sebastian!,3,7
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't even here!,3,7
Tom Haverford,Exactly.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"Hopefully I can get you out this mess, that you and no one else caused.",3,7
Jerry Gergich,You were the one watching him.,3,7
Tom Haverford,It's a poor workman that blames his tools.,3,7
Tom Haverford,You look for him.,3,7
Tom Haverford,I'm going to go tell everyone what you did.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,The Harvest Festival starts at 9:00 a.m tomorrow morning.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"And as far as this reporter is concerned, it's well worth your time.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Come on down, everyone.",3,7
Leslie Knope,It's going to be sweet.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"It pains me to say this, but great job here.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,3,7
Leslie Knope,That went well.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,3,7
Leslie Knope,It did.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Sorry?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,What is this about a curse?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Curse?,3,7
Leslie Knope,What?,3,7
Leslie Knope,Nothing.,3,7
Tom Haverford,Did you Leslie!,3,7
Tom Haverford,Leslie!,3,7
Tom Haverford,It's Little Sebastian.,3,7
Tom Haverford,He's gone.,3,7
Tom Haverford,"Jerry let him escape, and we don't know where he is.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Keep those cameras up.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,We've got a new intro to do.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Gotcha.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Let's go ahead.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Let's get some shots of chipped paint and crying babies.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,How about some of those spooky traffic lights?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"Okay, you know the drill.",3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Is it revenge of the Wamapoke?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,An incompetent government run amok?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,Or probably something even worse than any of those things?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"While it seemed everything was ready for tomorrow, things aren't always exactly as they may seem.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,"This is bad, right?",3,7
Leslie Knope,Yes this is bad.,3,7
Leslie Knope,This is like a poop tornado. This is like a poop-nado.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, gross, but we can handle a little bad publicity.",3,7
Leslie Knope,This is way worse than that.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Double lightning rod.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Plus, we lost that little pony.",3,7
Leslie Knope,It's a mini-horse.,3,7
Leslie Knope,And that's the third lightning rod.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Triple lightning rod.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"And then, you have the curse.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Quadruple lightning rod.,3,7
Leslie Knope,It's a classic four-rod distaster.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Oh right, one of those.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,Wait.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, but do people in this town really believe in curses?",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is an incredibly superstitious town. A travelling magician came through one time and he pulled a rabbit out of a hat, and the mob burned him at the stake for being a witch.",3,7
Leslie Knope,The year was 1973.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,We are really up a creek here.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,What the heck are we going to do?,3,7
Tom Haverford,You mean what are you gonna do?,3,7
Jerry Gergich,"No, what are do gonna you?",3,7
Tom Haverford,What am do gonna I? That's a great question Jerry.,3,7
Tom Haverford,Can you believe we left Little Sebastian with the gentleman?,3,7
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you were the one watching him.",3,7
Ron Swanson,"Okay apparently I'm gonna get any work done, how did this happen?",3,7
April Ludgate,Maybe Little Sebastian got upset because he tried to share his true feelings with someone and they didn't reciprocate.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,That's not bad.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Or maybe a balloon popped somewhere and it scared him, sent him running off.",3,7
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, check the field behind the parking lot.",3,7
Tom Haverford,I don't want to go with Jerry.,3,7
Tom Haverford,He's the one who deliberated caused me to accidentally let the horse out.,3,7
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.,3,7
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,Stop it.,3,7
Ron Swanson,Hang on. All of you listen to me.,3,7
Ron Swanson,That magnificent little horse is lost and he's probably scared and it's our fault.,3,7
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, you get along.",3,7
Ron Swanson,"Andy, April, check the corn maze.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,Good idea.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Horses love mazes.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Come on.,3,7
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie?",3,7
Ann Perkins,"This big, beefy dude just came into the first aid tent because he was dehydrated, and then, a reporter came in and asked if it was because of the curse.",3,7
Leslie Knope,No comment.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""No comment""?",3,7
Leslie Knope,"You've got to say ""No comment.""",3,7
Ann Perkins,I did.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Good, Ann.",3,7
Leslie Knope,You're so beautiful.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.,3,7
Leslie Knope,All right.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month.",3,7
Ann Perkins,Okay.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Run, Ann, run!",3,7
Ben Wyatt,Leslie?,3,7
Ben Wyatt,You've got to see this.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,3,7
Ken Hotate,Thank you for having me.,3,7
Ken Hotate,"The fact is, this carnival is being held on top of an ancient Wamapoke burial site.",3,7
Perd Hapley,Much like the house in the movie Poltergeist?,3,7
Ken Hotate,Exactly.,3,7
Ken Hotate,I spoke to Leslie Knope of the Parks Department about moving the carnival and she refused.,3,7
Perd Hapley,We do have exclusive animation of that event.,3,7
Perd Hapley,Let's take a look.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I love these things.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.,3,7
Perd Hapley,Is that what happened?,3,7
Leslie Knope,None of that happened.,3,7
Ken Hotate,That is exactly what happened.,3,7
Leslie Knope,All right.,3,7
Leslie Knope,All right.,3,7
Leslie Knope,What we do is we move the shooting gallery.,3,7
Leslie Knope,That seems to be their biggest problem.,3,7
Leslie Knope,Maybe that will make them happy.,3,7
Perd Hapley,"Check back in with News Channel 4, number one in curse coverage.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,You know where I would hide if I was horse. The merry-go-round. Think about it.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,You just stand still next to the other horses and no one would ever know.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,It's the perfect crime.,3,7
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God.",3,7
April Ludgate,I'm going to go look by myself.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, are you alright?",3,7
Andy Dwyer,You seem super not happy.,3,7
April Ludgate,I'm fine.,3,7
April Ludgate,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I might be going to Venezuela tomorrow.",3,7
April Ludgate,Forever.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,You're not fine.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Ludgate, I can read you like the back of a book. something is upsetting you.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is?,3,7
April Ludgate,I'm not upset.,3,7
April Ludgate,"I'm great, see.",3,7
April Ludgate,I'm not mad at Andy.,3,7
April Ludgate,Andy's great.,3,7
April Ludgate,I awesome sauce Andy.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,April!,3,7
Andy Dwyer,This maze is like a maze.,3,7
Ann Perkins,Left.,3,7
Ann Perkins,Look right.,3,7
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, okay.",3,7
Extra,"I don't know what's sicker, me or your body.",3,7
Ann Perkins,You aren't sick.,3,7
Extra,Maybe you should check out my abs.,3,7
Ann Perkins,Are you experiencing abdominal pain?,3,7
Extra,Every day at the gym.,3,7
Ann Perkins,Eww.,3,7
Extra,Feel.,3,7
Ann Perkins,Oh.,3,7
Extra,What are you doing tonight?,3,7
Ann Perkins,I'm prepping the medical tent.,3,7
Ann Perkins,I think I'm going to have to pass.,3,7
Extra,Your loss.,3,7
Donna Meagle,Are you going to hit that?,3,7
Ann Perkins,Him?,3,7
Ann Perkins,He isn't exactly boyfriend material.,3,7
Donna Meagle,Who said anything about a boyfriend?,3,7
Donna Meagle,Use him.,3,7
Donna Meagle,Abuse him.,3,7
Donna Meagle,Lose him.,3,7
Donna Meagle,That's the Meagle motto.,3,7
Donna Meagle,Grammy Meagle taught me that.,3,7
Donna Meagle,"She died at the age of 84, sandwiched between two 30 year olds.",3,7
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, hey, hey.",3,7
Jerry Gergich,Did you find him?,3,7
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry.",3,7
April Ludgate,He's right here in my pocket.,3,7
Ron Swanson,Damn it.,3,7
Ron Swanson,"Okay, he can't have gone that far. He's got the legs of Tom, the endurance of Jerry, and the diseases of Jerry.",3,7
Ron Swanson,Ground mission failed.,3,7
Ron Swanson,We need a bird's eye view.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,You want me to climb on top of the Ferris wheel?,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"We're extremely confident that there is no curse, and everyone is going to have a great time tomorrow.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,Okay?,3,7
Extra,Wow.,3,7
Extra,"First, Ice Town.",3,7
Extra,"Now, this.",3,7
Extra,"Bad luck really follows you around, huh?",3,7
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,7
Leslie Knope,I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"First of all, we have plenty of food.",3,7
Leslie Knope,There is no food shortage.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, ""feasting on petting zoo animals.""",3,7
Tom Haverford,"You were in charge of watching a tiny horse, and you failed.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I'm only going to say this once.",3,7
Andy Dwyer,What if Little Sebastian is on this Ferris wheel?,3,7
April Ludgate,How about you only say that never?,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, how big of a disaster will this be on a scale of nine to ten?",3,7
Leslie Knope,It will not be a disaster.,3,7
Leslie Knope,It will be a success.,3,7
Leslie Knope,"And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"So, yes, Perd.",3,7
Perd Hapley,"Yeah, the statement that this reporter has is a question.",3,7
Perd Hapley,Will that be enough to lift the curse?,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God.",3,7
Leslie Knope,Crap on a spatula.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,It's the curse.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,That's exactly what it is.,3,7
Joan Callamezzo,You know what?,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, relax.",3,7
Leslie Knope,"Please, we'll get this up and running in no time.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"Well Jerry, what the hell?",3,7
Jerry Gergich,I didn't do this.,3,7
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.,3,7
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.,3,7
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.,3,7
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.,3,7
Leslie Knope,We cannot catch a break.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, well, I'll help you out.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go.,3,7
Leslie Knope,What?,3,7
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I'm jinxed or something.,3,7
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you were totally fine until I got involved.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,"So, I feel like I should probably just go.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,Okay?,3,7
Ben Wyatt,I'm really sorry.,3,7
Ben Wyatt,"I'm the curse, I think.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm going to get out of here.",3,7
Ben Wyatt,All right?,3,7
Jerry Gergich,"When they're missing this long, they're usually dead.",3,7
Tom Haverford,"Well, if that's true, then you're going to have to answer to the whole town.",3,7
Tom Haverford,And God.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,Okay.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,"You were the one who let him out, Tom.",3,7
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now, stop trying to blame me.",3,7
April Ludgate,"Jerry, can you please be quiet?",3,7
April Ludgate,I can't hear myself not talking to Andy.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, will you please tell me why April is mad at me?",3,7
April Ludgate,"Ron, can you please tell Andy",3,7
Ron Swanson,"All of you, be quiet.",3,7
Ron Swanson,"Andy, she's mad because you said ""awesome sauce"" instead of ""I love you, too.""",3,7
Ron Swanson,"April, he loves you.",3,7
Ron Swanson,Stop being a child.,3,7
Ron Swanson,"Tom, you're clearly at fault here.",3,7
Ron Swanson,Blaming Jerry won't save you.,3,7
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Little Sebastian.",3,7
Ron Swanson,"So, everyone apologize to everyone else.",3,7
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Tom.",3,7
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,I do love you.,3,7
April Ludgate,You do?,3,7
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,3,7
Andy Dwyer,"That's what, you know, makes the sauce so awesome.",3,7
Tom Haverford,Jerry just farted.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,I'm very upset.,3,7
Jerry Gergich,I get nervous.,3,7
Ed,"Hey, Leslie?",3,7
Ed,Generator's shot.,3,7
Leslie Knope,No.,3,7
Leslie Knope,I got the T.M.K. 2500 specifically for the extra capacity.,3,7
Ed,Wow.,3,7
Ed,You know your stuff.,3,7
Ed,You single?,3,7
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ed.",3,7
Leslie Knope,How could that happen?,3,7

Leslie Knope,He was an amazing dentist.,3,8
Ann Perkins,"You know, when he saw me, I swear his face lit up.",3,8
Leslie Knope,Ann.,3,8
Ann Perkins,"What do you think ""We should get together soon"" means?",3,8

Ron Swanson,Fishing relaxes me.,3,8
Ron Swanson,"It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,All right.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,I call this wonderful spot.,3,8
Jerry Gergich,You didn't bring a tent?,3,8
Ben Wyatt,"I don't really go camping ever, Jerry.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm not going to spend 150 dollars on a tent.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.,3,8
Ron Swanson,It's called the ground when it's outside.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.,3,8

Andy Dwyer,Complete with beautiful starlight.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,We got champagne.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,"Also, rose petals.",3,8
Andy Dwyer,"As you can see, they smell terrific.",3,8
Leslie Knope,"We need big ideas, and we need 'em now.",3,8
Leslie Knope,Who wants to go first?,3,8
Ron Swanson,I propose that we take all the money we made from the Harvest Festival and return it to the citizens.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"So, how much would that be per person?",3,8
Ron Swanson,About 83 cents.,3,8
Ron Swanson,Per household.,3,8
Ron Swanson,Before postage.,3,8
Ron Swanson,Are we done?,3,8
Tom Haverford,"What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and Drake all have in common?",3,8
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I know this one.",3,8
Jerry Gergich,They are all rappists.,3,8
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God.",3,8
Jerry Gergich,"They're rappers, Jerry.",3,8
Tom Haverford,And what they have in common is none of them have ever performed in Pawnee.,3,8
Tom Haverford,Why?,3,8
Tom Haverford,Because we don't have an adequate concert venue.,3,8
Tom Haverford,Until now.,3,8
Tom Haverford,The Pawnee Amphitheater.,3,8
Ann Perkins,How much would that cost?,3,8
Tom Haverford,Not that much.,3,8
Tom Haverford,"200, 300 million.",3,8
Ann Perkins,Right.,3,8
Leslie Knope,Great.,3,8
Donna Meagle,Luxury dog park.,3,8

Andy Dwyer,Where are you?,3,8
April Ludgate,"We're inside the main entrance, near the sign that says ""Pawnee Campground.""",3,8
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a totally different place.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,That's why we can't see each other.,3,8
April Ludgate,"My God, Andy, I don't even wanna be here.",3,8
April Ludgate,The air is too fresh.,3,8
April Ludgate,It's disgusting.,3,8
April Ludgate,I can't breathe.,3,8
April Ludgate,There's a brook somewhere that won't stop babbling.,3,8
April Ludgate,Shut up!,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Sweetheart.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Just hold tight and I'll be there.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,"Well, April is right here.",3,8

Ben Wyatt,Make 4% a year.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,"You know, set up a nice little nest egg for the city.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?,3,8
Tom Haverford,Great idea.,3,8
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, white Urkel.",3,8

Ben Wyatt,"Maybe it's not the sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart.",3,8
Tom Haverford,What are you even still doing here?,3,8
Tom Haverford,Harvest Festival is over.,3,8
Tom Haverford,Shouldn't you be back in Indianapolis?,3,8
Leslie Knope,Hey.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works.",3,8
Leslie Knope,And he's a valuable asset to the team.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.,3,8
Leslie Knope,April has not presented her idea.,3,8
Leslie Knope,April?,3,8
April Ludgate,I didn't come up with anything.,3,8
Leslie Knope,Why?,3,8
April Ludgate,"Because I know that whatever we come up with isn't gonna be good enough anyway, and we're just gonna go with your idea.",3,8
Ron Swanson,She's got a point.,3,8
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us what your idea is so I can go back to the Thunderdome.",3,8
Tom Haverford,That's what I'm calling my tent.,3,8
Leslie Knope,I am really disappointed in all of you.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"You know, the whole town is looking at us right now.",3,8
Leslie Knope,And you're letting 'em down.,3,8
Leslie Knope,Take an hour.,3,8
Leslie Knope,Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department.",3,8
Leslie Knope,"Then, after that, I will tell you my idea.",3,8
Ann Perkins,Wow.,3,8
Ann Perkins,You really let 'em have it.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had no choice.",3,8
Leslie Knope,I didn't wanna tell them my idea.,3,8
Ann Perkins,Why not?,3,8
Leslie Knope,Because I don't have one.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"I don't have an idea, Ann.",3,8
Leslie Knope,"I'm so screwed, Ann.",3,8
Leslie Knope,"The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything.",3,8
Ann Perkins,Why not just build the park on the lot behind my house?,3,8
Leslie Knope,Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.,3,8
Ann Perkins,What about those binders in your office?,3,8
Leslie Knope,They're filled with small ideas.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"We need a big, juicy idea.",3,8
Leslie Knope,"I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me.",3,8
Ann Perkins,"""I married Alf and we're pretty happy.""",3,8
Ann Perkins,That sounds nice.,3,8
Leslie Knope,It was.,3,8
Ann Perkins,"Okay, listen to me.",3,8
Ann Perkins,"You are smart and creative and talented, and you're gonna be fine.",3,8
Leslie Knope,You're probably right.,3,8
Leslie Knope,I just need an hour and it'll come to me.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Hello?,3,8
April Ludgate,"Andy, you have to save me.",3,8
April Ludgate,I'm camping with people I work with.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Hello.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,April.,3,8
April Ludgate,Hello?,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Walk around in circles like I am.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Help triangulate the phone call.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Hello?,3,8
Andy Dwyer,Hang on.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna try to get to higher ground.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,I found some thorns.,3,8
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, yes, my daughter might think she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend.",3,8
Jerry Gergich,"But I'm sorry, 16, that just seems too young to be on birth control.",3,8
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity.",3,8
Ron Swanson,What say we just stand here in silence and think of ideas for projects?,3,8
Jerry Gergich,You know what I should do?,3,8
Jerry Gergich,I should lead a teen abstinence workshop.,3,8
Ron Swanson,That might be incredibly effective.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom.",3,8
Tom Haverford,One second.,3,8
Tom Haverford,I'm just in the middle of a head massage.,3,8
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a good stopping point.",3,8
Tom Haverford,What's up?,3,8
Ben Wyatt,You wanna bounce some ideas off each other?,3,8
Tom Haverford,Here's a better idea.,3,8
Tom Haverford,How about I bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little Season Six of Top Chef?,3,8
Ben Wyatt,All right.,3,8
Tom Haverford,I know Leslie seems upset.,3,8
Tom Haverford,"But the truth is, she's better than us at this stuff by a thousand miles.",3,8
Tom Haverford,"So, there's really no point.",3,8
Tom Haverford,Care for some fondue?,3,8
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,Hey.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,How do you afford all this stuff?,3,8
Tom Haverford,I just return it the next day and claim it was defective.,3,8
Tom Haverford,The key is crying a lot.,3,8
Tom Haverford,No one likes to hear a grown man cry.,3,8
Tom Haverford,"""And then, my hand accidentally went in the panini press!""",3,8
Leslie Knope,Hey.,3,8
Leslie Knope,You wanna go for a walk?,3,8
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,Wow.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,The sky is really beautiful.,3,8
Leslie Knope,It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma?",3,8
Ben Wyatt,No.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal.",3,8
Leslie Knope,I'm probably making too much out of it.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,It's really big.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you got everyone's attention with the Harvest Festival.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you're gonna seal the deal.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,It's the chance you've been waiting for.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that?",3,8
Ben Wyatt,Then you wouldn't be Leslie Knope.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself?",3,8
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,"No, no.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,Not at all.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.,3,8
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're like the Energizer Bunny of city government.",3,8
Ron Swanson,"And when she looked in the back of her car, she saw that even though it was her own private property, she would be forced to take it in for a state inspection!",3,8
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys.",3,8
Leslie Knope,Listen up.,3,8
Donna Meagle,What was that?,3,8
Leslie Knope,That was me talking.,3,8
April Ludgate,"No, I heard it, too.",3,8
April Ludgate,Andy?,3,8
Tom Haverford,"If that's a coyote, someone needs to pick me up off the ground now.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!",3,8
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys.",3,8
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing here?,3,8
Chris Traeger,"I was just out for my night time run, and I thought, ""Why not go visit the Parks Department?"" How's everything going here?",3,8
Leslie Knope,Super great.,3,8
Leslie Knope,Really well.,3,8
Leslie Knope,We have a great idea.,3,8
Chris Traeger,Tell me now while I sit on this boulder.,3,8
Chris Traeger,I'm much more receptive to new ideas when my heart rate is still elevated.,3,8
Ann Perkins,"Chris, do you wanna maybe just talk for a minute? Let them work?",3,8
Chris Traeger,Oh! Sure.,3,8
Andy Dwyer,What was that? What was that?,3,8
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us your idea.",3,8
Tom Haverford,"Los Angeles, Season One isn't gonna watch itself.",3,8
Leslie Knope,Here it is.,3,8
Leslie Knope,What do you think? I don't have an idea.,3,8
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something.",3,8
Leslie Knope,"But I don't have anything, and we're totally screwed.",3,8
Leslie Knope,And what we need to do is just keep working and just work again more and just do it and get it.,3,8
Leslie Knope,And then we got it and we're good.,3,8
Leslie Knope,Go with that.,3,8
Ron Swanson,I think I'm gonna turn in.,3,8
Leslie Knope,You're not going anywhere.,3,8
Leslie Knope,No one's going anywhere.,3,8
Leslie Knope,No one's sleeping because this is an all-nighter.,3,8
Leslie Knope,And that'll be fun.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"We'll all stay up and then, I'll be like, ""Hey! No one sleep!"" Do you hear how loud that is? You're not sleeping through that.",3,8
April Ludgate,Is there anything else to eat? The marshmallows are all gone.,3,8
Ron Swanson,We have nothing to eat.,3,8
Ron Swanson,Jerry scared all the fish away with his loud personal stories.,3,8
Donna Meagle,I wanna go home.,3,8
Donna Meagle,I miss my canopy bed.,3,8
April Ludgate,Yeah.,3,8
April Ludgate,I'm fine with not camping.,3,8
April Ludgate,Especially since my stupid boyfriend abandoned me!,3,8
Ron Swanson,I'll fire up the van.,3,8
Chris Traeger,"You know, I've never moved this slowly before.",3,8
Chris Traeger,It's almost like being in quicksand.,3,8
Ann Perkins,"Hey, um, listen.",3,8
Ann Perkins,"When you dumped me, it was really embarrassing.",3,8
Ann Perkins,You just kind of took off.,3,8
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I'm so sorry.",3,8
Chris Traeger,"I mean, I never meant to hurt you.",3,8
Chris Traeger,"And well, I'm back now.",3,8
Chris Traeger,"Hey, I have a great idea.",3,8
Chris Traeger,Why don't we go to this rustic diner that I know? We can have egg white omelets and we can continue to talk about us.,3,8
Ann Perkins,Sounds good.,3,8
Ron Swanson,"No, no.",3,8

Leslie Knope,We should buy a telescope and make the old ranger station in Ramsett Park an observatory.,3,8

Chris Traeger,I like it.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"Good. We'll have theme night at the park. Have singles, date night, seniors.",3,8
Leslie Knope,We could have a city-wide yard sale.,3,8
Leslie Knope,"Which could be part auction, part antique roadshow, then we could have professors come in and assign value to the objects.",3,8
Leslie Knope,"We could split the profits with the school, it'd be a lot of fun.",3,8
Ron Swanson,I'll see you boys later.,3,8
Leslie Knope,Bye Ron.,3,8
Leslie Knope,They say you're only as good as your last idea.,3,8

Ron Swanson,Shut up and look at me!,3,11
Ron Swanson,"Welcome to ""Visions of Nature.""",3,11
Ron Swanson,This room has several paintings in it.,3,11
Ron Swanson,Some are big.,3,11
Ron Swanson,Some are small.,3,11
Ron Swanson,"People did them, and they are here now.",3,11
Ron Swanson,"I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings.",3,11
Ron Swanson,Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.,3,11
Ron Swanson,I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.,3,11
Ron Swanson,"Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further.",3,11
Ron Swanson,End of speech.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,And that's the TV room.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's a mess.",3,11
April Ludgate,Can you throw that in the trash can?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"I was just here, like, three weeks ago for your wedding.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,What happened?,3,11
April Ludgate,"Well, Burly moved out.",3,11
April Ludgate,He was the one that did all the cleaning and throwing away and stuff.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, he moved out, like, a week ago.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,You guys made this mess in a week?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I always think April's going to clean up.",3,11
April Ludgate,And I never clean up.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"It's cute, right?",3,11
Ben Wyatt,No.,3,11
April Ludgate,"Yes, it is.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,Are you guys frying marbles?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,We were checking to see if the fire alarm worked.,3,11
April Ludgate,It doesn't.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,The biggest challenge to picking the perfect roommate is finding someone who's willing to pay more than their share of rent without knowing it.,3,11
April Ludgate,I think we found that in Ben.,3,11
Ron Swanson,"You forgot to paint a painting, son.",3,11
Jerry Gergich,"So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag.",3,11
Ann Perkins,It's stunning.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"It's breathtaking, Jerry.",3,11
Donna Meagle,Yeah.,3,11
Donna Meagle,It really is.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,Wow.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, guys.",3,11
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, you should really come over here and look at Jerry's painting.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",3,11
Leslie Knope,That's me.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Is that me?,3,11
Jerry Gergich,What?,3,11
Jerry Gergich,No.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, it does look like you.",3,11
Leslie Knope,You're just realizing that now?,3,11
Tom Haverford,"That's what you see when you close your eyes at night, Jerry.",3,11
Tom Haverford,Topless Leslie glued to a horse.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,Okay.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I am just so, so sorry.",3,11
Jerry Gergich,"Dyaphena, she is this powerful goddess, and I've been thinking a lot about powerful women, and subconsciously, I painted you.",3,11
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,I'm going to take it right down.,3,11
Leslie Knope,No.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Leave it up.,3,11
Leslie Knope,I love it.,3,11
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to explain it.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, ""What can't that centaur woman do?""",3,11
Leslie Knope,"""Besides ride an escalator and drive a car.""",3,11
Leslie Knope,Art can be so magnificent.,3,11
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",3,11
Ann Perkins,The baby is Tom.,3,11
Tom Haverford,What?,3,11
Ann Perkins,This is easily my favorite painting ever.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"What the hell, Jerry?",3,11
Tom Haverford,Look at my pot belly.,3,11
Tom Haverford,I look like a pregnant baby.,3,11
Tom Haverford,And why am I so scared?,3,11
Tom Haverford,"All right, we've got to take this down.",3,11
Tom Haverford,Now.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom.",3,11
Leslie Knope,It's staying right here.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow lover of the arts.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the painting.,3,11
Extra,"What, is that you?",3,11
Extra,"Well, it's hot.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,3,11
Ann Perkins,"This guy's in it, too.",3,11
Ann Perkins,He's the little fat baby.,3,11
Extra,Cool.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,3,11
Ann Perkins,What's going on right here?,3,11
Tom Haverford,Baby rolls!,3,11
Tom Haverford,We've been trying to get that light fixed for months.,3,11
Tom Haverford,Thank you.,3,11
Extra,Thank her.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Tom.",3,11
Extra,She marched into my office this morning and told me she wouldn't leave until I got this done.,3,11
Tom Haverford,Hmm.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm glad someone's feeling good.",3,11
Tom Haverford,They're going to hang that painting in a public building where anybody can see it.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"In one brush stroke, Jerry has killed the JayZ vibe that's taken me years to cultivate and replaced it with the fat, brown baby vibe, which is not as cool of a vibe.",3,11
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Aphrodite.",3,11
Donna Meagle,Chris needs you in his office.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Hmm.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"When you're done with the light, fix the printer.",3,11
Extra,I don't know how to fix printers.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Learn it.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, should I go, too?",3,11
Leslie Knope,"This isn't about you, Jerry.",3,11
Jerry Gergich,It's my painting.,3,11
Marcia Langman,Why am I upset?,3,11
Marcia Langman,Let's start with government funded animal porn.,3,11
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that's fair.,3,11
Marcia Langman,"I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Bestiality?,3,11
Leslie Knope,"It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse.",3,11
Marcia Langman,And how did it get like that?,3,11
Marcia Langman,Who had sex with what and gave birth to which?,3,11
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution.",3,11
Marcia Langman,Destroy it.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Destroy it?,3,11
Leslie Knope,"I mean, is she serious?",3,11
Leslie Knope,Do you find this personally offensive?,3,11
Chris Traeger,"Not personally, no.",3,11
Chris Traeger,"No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form.",3,11
Chris Traeger,I've dabbled in nude sculpture.,3,11
Chris Traeger,I've posed nude.,3,11
Chris Traeger,"In college, I was in a nude production of Cats.",3,11
Chris Traeger,"But I am not in the nude now, am I?",3,11
Chris Traeger,Because we're in a government building.,3,11
Chris Traeger,"And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying.",3,11
Chris Traeger,"So, take care of this situation.",3,11
Leslie Knope,That painting is not going to be destroyed.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Every great work of art contains a message.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"And the message of this painting is, ""Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia.""",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Morning, roomie.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,How did you sleep?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were no bedbugs.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Also, no bed.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go buy a bed.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Fork.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"It's pretty cute, right?",3,11
Ben Wyatt,No.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Do you know what ""cute"" means?",3,11
April Ludgate,What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,What have you guys got against washing dishes?,3,11
April Ludgate,"We don't have any dishes, okay?",3,11
April Ludgate,Burly took them all when he left.,3,11
April Ludgate,"Now, I bet you feel like a jerk.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,God.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,No.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,We already spent your money on a new Xbox 360 and more frisbees to eat off of.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,You've got to stay.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,God.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,All right.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Here's the deal.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,We're going to clean this place up.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"And then, I am going to teach you how to be adults.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,Cool.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,We'll get to be adults.,3,11
April Ludgate,"Gee, golly.",3,11
April Ludgate,"Thanks, mister.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,Fork.,3,11
Perd Hapley,Hello.,3,11
Perd Hapley,"I'm Perd Hapley, and welcome to Ya' Heard?",3,11
Perd Hapley,With Perd.,3,11
Perd Hapley,Today's show begins now.,3,11
Perd Hapley,Is this art or is it pornography?,3,11
Perd Hapley,"Here to answer this question is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director, Leslie Knope.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Perd, it is a beautiful work of art.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one.",3,11
Perd Hapley,But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.,3,11
Perd Hapley,You are the subject of this painting.,3,11
Perd Hapley,"Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts.",3,11
Leslie Knope,I am not the subject.,3,11
Leslie Knope,The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.,3,11
Leslie Knope,But it does look a little bit like me.,3,11
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real?",3,11
Leslie Knope,No.,3,11
Perd Hapley,Absolutely sure?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"So, you always separate your lights from your darks.",3,11
April Ludgate,That's racist.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"And then, you get your laundry-- Where is your laundry detergent?",3,11
Andy Dwyer,Right.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Here we are.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,This is bubble bath.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,You guys-- You wash your clothes in bubble bath?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Bubble bath, clothes soap, same thing.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Well, they both make bubbles, so.",3,11
Leslie Knope,It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.,3,11
Perd Hapley,Okay.,3,11
Perd Hapley,Also joining us today is a different person.,3,11
Perd Hapley,"Pornographic film actress, Brandi Maxxxx.",3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,Pleasure to be here.,3,11
Perd Hapley,"Brandi, you've starred in over 200 adult films, some of which are very good.",3,11
Perd Hapley,When did you get into the business?,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,Last year.,3,11
Perd Hapley,Fantastic.,3,11
Perd Hapley,"Now, this painting right here, art or pornography?",3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,"Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous.",3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,What Leslie and I do is obviously art.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Hang on.,3,11
Leslie Knope,There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,"It's okay, Leslie.",3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,I got this one.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,"Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or what have you.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Okay.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Hang on.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Pornography is very difficult to define.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, ""I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it.""",3,11
Perd Hapley,"Brandi, how would you define pornography?",3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,"For me, it's when the penis goes in.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,"All right, we need to do some basic organization.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,Where do you put your bills when they come?,3,11
April Ludgate,I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Which I organize into a pile or stack that I put into the freezer.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Why?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,So they won't get lost.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Bingo.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you have to pay these.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,Good thing I didn't lose them.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,New lesson.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Basic finance.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,I am going to teach you how to open a bank account.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Bank account.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Good.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford.",3,11
Tom Haverford,I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.,3,11
Tom Haverford,I totally agree with you that people should be allowed to have sex in public places.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,You look familiar to me.,3,11
Tom Haverford,Maybe you've seen me down at the Snakehole Lounge.,3,11
Tom Haverford,I'm a part owner there.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,That's you.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,In the painting.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,You're the fat baby.,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,Aw! That's so cute.,3,11
Tom Haverford,Oh.,3,11
Tom Haverford,You're into that?,3,11
Brandi Maxxxx,No.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry.",3,11
Chris Traeger,Imagine my horror.,3,11
Chris Traeger,I'm hanging upside down with my gravity boots watching Perd.,3,11
Chris Traeger,"I see you with your painting, and I am startled and disappointed.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film.",3,11
Chris Traeger,I urge you not to take that role.,3,11
Leslie Knope,I am not going to take the role.,3,11
Chris Traeger,"That's good to hear, because recently, you've been a little unpredictable.",3,11
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Leslie.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Stand down, Jerry.",3,11
Leslie Knope,This isn't your fight.,3,11
Chris Traeger,You've left me no choice.,3,11
Chris Traeger,"I have convened a meeting of the Public Arts Commission, and we will abide by their decision.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Fine with me.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Public Arts Commission.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.,3,11
Chris Traeger,I would just like to introduce myself.,3,11
Chris Traeger,"My name is Chris Traeger, and I am a big fan of art.",3,11
Tom Haverford,"Council, I am not opposed to pornography.",3,11
Tom Haverford,"In fact, you could say I'm definitely for it.",3,11
Tom Haverford,"If I had my laptop right now, I would show you a well-hidden folder with gigabytes of proof.",3,11
Tom Haverford,"However, this thing is disgusting and wrong.",3,11
Extra,Please let the record reflect that the fat baby is referring to the painting.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I am not a fat baby.",3,11
Tom Haverford,"I'm a small, slender man, similar to actor Taye Diggs.",3,11
Tom Haverford,So let the record reflect that.,3,11
Tom Haverford,That I look like Tay Diggs.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Members of the Public Art Commission, good afternoon and good art.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Every great society has always supported artistic expression.,3,11
Leslie Knope,The Romans.,3,11
Marcia Langman,Perverts.,3,11
Leslie Knope,The Greeks.,3,11
Marcia Langman,Gay perverts.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Two great societies in Europe.,3,11
Marcia Langman,Europeans.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"There are some members of this community that would like to demonize this painting, and when they do they in fact demonize art itself.",3,11
Leslie Knope,What is or isn't art is up to every free thinking American to decide on their own.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's in the bag.",3,11
Leslie Knope,We've decided that the painting should be destroyed.,3,11
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, burn it.",3,11
Leslie Knope,What are you serious?,3,11
Leslie Knope,You're supposed to be in favor of public art.,3,11
Extra,"Yeah but there's nipples in it, so I figure we ought to be safe and destroy it.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here is a list of errands and things that human adults need.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm giving you an advance on next month's rent, and I want you guys to go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and get everything on that list.",3,11
April Ludgate,Or we can buy a Wii.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,You can handle this.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know man, why don't you just handle it?",3,11
Ben Wyatt,"No, I can't, I have a date.",3,11
April Ludgate,What's his name?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"It's actually not, Chris set it up.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,Never mind.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Point is, stick to the list and you'll do great.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,I have total faith in you.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,There's like a 30% chance they'll both die.,3,11
Marcia Langman,So how do you want to do this?,3,11
Marcia Langman,Burn it publicly or burn it privately and I put the footage on my blog,3,11
Leslie Knope,"You've made your point, okay",3,11
Leslie Knope,Look this painting is very important to me,3,11
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't need to hang in a government building, just let me take it home and I'll keep it there.",3,11
Leslie Knope,What do you say?,3,11
Marcia Langman,"I say, this painting is going to burn.",3,11
Marcia Langman,"First here, then in hell.",3,11
Marcia Langman,Do I need to get this validated?,3,11
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,3,11
Marcia Langman,"Okay, I'll just pull my car around and you can load it in the back.",3,11
Leslie Knope,No.,3,11
Marcia Langman,"Hey, come back here.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Make me stag, I am Diaphena.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,This place is amazing.,3,11
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have a thing that makes sherbet, we need five of those.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"No, we need to stick with what's on the list.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"First things first, oven mitts.",3,11

Andy Dwyer,"Iron gym, I am going to get so buff.",3,11
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, marshmallow shooter",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Marshmallow shooter, get two.",3,11
April Ludgate,Wait what about the magic bullet?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I've seen that.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,Hi.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"I was at a meeting around the corner and some people wanted to destroy this painting, so I brought it here.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Where is Andy and April?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,They're out shopping.,3,11
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,I moved into the spare room.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Really, huh",3,11
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah sure of course.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,Why do they want to destroy it.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Well it's a painting of me as a centaur.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,11
Leslie Knope,And it's a nude.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Oh.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Just basically like the chestal region, mostly.",3,11
Leslie Knope,You don't have to look at it if you don't want to.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,No no no.,3,11
Leslie Knope,It's very classy.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"yeah no, I'm sure it is.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh man it's chris, I'm gonna take this.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Hi Chris.,3,11
Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope, you need to bring that painting back.",3,11
Leslie Knope,What painting?,3,11
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have the painting, and you need to bring it back in.",3,11
Chris Traeger,"I think I've been pretty fair with you, and I'm beginning to feel angry.",3,11
Chris Traeger,"and I don't like feeling angry, my heart is racing, it's going at literally 45 beats per minute.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, if I could just explain to you my point of view.",3,11
Chris Traeger,"You will bring that painting in tomorrow morning, and surrender it to Marcia Langman, and that's that.",3,11
Chris Traeger,Do you understand me madam?,3,11
April Ludgate,Mighty Putty.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,What are we doing?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,We didn't get a single thing that Ben told us to.,3,11
April Ludgate,Sure we did.,3,11
April Ludgate,We got the marshmallow shooter.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,I don't think that's on the list.,3,11
April Ludgate,But I want it.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,I want it too.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,But I also kind of want my own fork.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Because you eat really slow, which is cute, but also super annoying.",3,11
April Ludgate,Fine.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"What, what's wrong?",3,11
April Ludgate,"Nothing, it's just adults are boring, and I hate them, and I don't want to buy all this stupid boring adult stuff and become boring adults.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Hey listen to me, yes we're going to get a dish rack and shower curtains and a cutting board, but if you think for one seond I'm not also going to get that marshmallow shooter so I can shoot you in the face with marshmallows while you sleep, then you're the dumbest woman I know.",3,11
April Ludgate,You're going to make me cry.,3,11
Leslie Knope,You're a level-headed person.,3,11
Leslie Knope,What do I do here?,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, it is one of the basic rules of government that you shouldn't offend people.",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I guess you're right.",3,11
Leslie Knope,I'm so annoyed by all these rules lately.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Me too.,3,11
April Ludgate,Come back here.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Hey Leslie, what are you doing here?",3,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, I stole a painting, and I was hoping you guys would help me hide it.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"I like it, it's very simple.",3,11
Leslie Knope,No it's on the other side.,3,11
April Ludgate,"Oh my God, is that you as a naked horse.",3,11
Leslie Knope,Does that look like me I don't even,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, not to be inappropriate or anything, because you're my boss and my friend, but I would totally hit that.",3,11
April Ludgate,So would I.,3,11
Leslie Knope,You guys are sweet.,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I should go, hit the road with this and...",3,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay,3,11
Leslie Knope,I'll see you later.,3,11
April Ludgate,Bye.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Bye Leslie.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"So, how did we do?",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, does this answer your question.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,"No, did you buy plates",3,11
Andy Dwyer,Oh plates.,3,11
Jerry Gergich,Leslie what are you doing?,3,11
Leslie Knope,"Say goodbye to Diaphena, I have to turn her over to stupid Marcia Langman.",3,11
Jerry Gergich,"Really, wow.",3,11
Leslie Knope,What?,3,11
Jerry Gergich,I mean to be honest that seems like the kind of thing I would do and I didn't think you would give in.,3,11
Leslie Knope,Come with me.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Hey man.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Roomie, dude, super fun to eat cereal from a bowl with a spoon.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for that.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,No problem.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,Though you know you're not supposed to bring your dishes into work right.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,What's going on between you and Leslie?,3,11
Andy Dwyer,I noticed a weird vibe when we came into the room.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"Nothing, we're friends, just regular friendship development.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, roomie, you can tell me, I bet there's something.",3,11
Andy Dwyer,I bet you I can guess what it is.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,She stole money from you.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"What, no, no, Andy.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,She did not.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,I think we like each other.,3,11
Ben Wyatt,"But Chris has this very strict rule, coworkers can't date.",3,11
Ben Wyatt,So it's not even an option.,3,11
Andy Dwyer,Wow.,3,11

Leslie Knope,Is that new?,3,12
Leslie Knope,"No, that's been there since the '90s.",3,12
Leslie Knope,What are you doing for your birthday on Friday?,3,12
Ron Swanson,Nothing.,3,12
Ron Swanson,I never Aha!,3,12
Ron Swanson,"Oh, God.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.,3,12
Leslie Knope,He's even had it redacted on all government documents.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday.",3,12
Ron Swanson,Damn it.,3,12
Ron Swanson,I was so careful.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, you blew it.",3,12
Leslie Knope,All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Was it worth it, Ron?",3,12
Leslie Knope,Was it?,3,12
Ron Swanson,I command you to do nothing.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna do nothing.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do something.,3,12
Leslie Knope,And it's gonna be really big.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I have a lot of years to make up for.,3,12
Ron Swanson,"I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me.",3,12
Ron Swanson,"Plus, the whole thing is a scam.",3,12
Ron Swanson,Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.,3,12
Tom Haverford,They put up a fence.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Who?,3,12
Leslie Knope,No!,3,12
Ben Wyatt,What's that?,3,12
Leslie Knope,"There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and--",3,12
Tom Haverford,Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.,3,12
Tom Haverford,There's even a security guard.,3,12
Tom Haverford,You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.,3,12
Donna Meagle,Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.,3,12
Donna Meagle,And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.,3,12
Donna Meagle,With a Harman Kardon Logic surround sound system.,3,12
Ben Wyatt,Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground?,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay.",3,12
Andy Dwyer,Who?,3,12
Leslie Knope,Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.,3,12
Leslie Knope,We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Then she went to work in Eagleton and ""fixed her deviated septum"" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else.",3,12
Leslie Knope,What was it again?,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Her soul.,3,12
Ben Wyatt,Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side?,3,12
Leslie Knope,"To be fair, yeah.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.,3,12
Leslie Knope,But it has a lot of heart.,3,12
April Ludgate,That's what people always say when something sucks.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"We should stand up for our town, okay?",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier.",3,12
Tom Haverford,People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.,3,12
Tom Haverford,I would never set foot over there.,3,12
Tom Haverford,"But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I am on ""Operation No More Fence,"" so I'm putting you in charge of ""Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe.""",3,12
April Ludgate,I am all over it.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I just need you to do what's on that list.,3,12
Ron Swanson,Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.,3,12
Ron Swanson,But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.,3,12
Extra,It's the only park in our neighborhood.,3,12
Extra,"I mean, where are my kids supposed to play, the rock quarry?",3,12
Extra,There's rocks in there.,3,12
Extra,Why don't we just set fire to the fence?,3,12
Extra,"You know, set it ablaze.",3,12
Leslie Knope,That's arson.,3,12
Extra,"Well, let's leave that up to the lawyers.",3,12
Extra,"The point is, it would work.",3,12
Extra,Why don't we build a fence around their fence?,3,12
Extra,Why?,3,12
Extra,"It would give us two fences, so if they needed to get to their fence for maintenance and whatnot, their pants might get caught.",3,12
Extra,"My son Joey tried to scale that fence to play on the Eagleton side, and he fell and hurt his arm.",3,12
Extra,You need to get those people to tear that fence down.,3,12
Leslie Knope,This woman's right.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence.",3,12
Extra,"Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one more time that we burn it down.",3,12
Extra,But whatever you guys think.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Great.,3,12
April Ludgate,"Yes, hi.",3,12
April Ludgate,I have a question about your inflatable saxophones.,3,12
April Ludgate,Do those come in different sizes?,3,12
April Ludgate,I'm gonna need about 40 dozen of those.,3,12
April Ludgate,"Also, what about your neon gangster fedora hats?",3,12
April Ludgate,That was rude.,3,12
Ron Swanson,"Whatever's going on here, stop it immediately.",3,12
April Ludgate,I was just talking on the phone.,3,12
Ron Swanson,To whom?,3,12
April Ludgate,It was personal.,3,12

Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yeah.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you so much for stopping by.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was passing through Pawnee anyway.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do a lot of charity work here.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,There's only so much you can do.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Look at that.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Let me get a closer look.,3,12
Leslie Knope,So let's talk about Lafayette Park.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Oh, yes.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm only trying to protect our children.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone.",3,12
Leslie Knope,That's what makes them so great.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You know what's really great?,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,A private park that's not for everyone.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Wowsers.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What do you care?,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's just a crappy little park.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hmm.,3,12
Leslie Knope,And that someone was this woman.,3,12
Leslie Knope,You can take it if you want.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I have many copies and the negatives.,3,12
Leslie Knope,And I have a JPEG.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence stays up.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Lindsay, if we",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Sweetie, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, Pawnee is and always will be a dirty, little nightmare from which you will never wake up.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,But it was good seeing you.,3,12
Leslie Knope,What?,3,12
Leslie Knope,I'm not asleep.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I'm awake.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you.",3,12
Leslie Knope,That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.,3,12
Leslie Knope,What did I say instead?,3,12
Ben Wyatt,Wow!,3,12
Ben Wyatt,This is where they have their public forums?,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's not that great.",3,12
Tom Haverford,They had a valet.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla.",3,12
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah.",3,12
Ben Wyatt,Wow.,3,12
Leslie Knope,But their people are not inherently better than our people.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Who cares?,3,12
Leslie Knope,Factoid alert.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Pawnee was established in May of 1817.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hello, Pawnee.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Welcome to our public forum.,3,12
Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Thomas Montgomery Haverford.",3,12

Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You have a million flyaways right now.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Would you like to borrow a mirror or a selfhelp book?,3,12
Leslie Knope,I would not.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Pun intended.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Well, you don't have my job because you knew you couldn't handle it.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The forum is beginning.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"We've got a little bit of Eagleton business, and then I'll introduce you.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Great.,3,12
Tom Haverford,Look how pretty the people are.,3,12
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ron.",3,12

Ann Perkins,Oh!,3,12

Ann Perkins,These were for a sick child at the hospital.,3,12
Ron Swanson,"My office, now.",3,12
Ann Perkins,I don't work for you.,3,12
Ron Swanson,Don't care.,3,12
Tom Haverford,"Decisions, decisions.",3,12
Tom Haverford,"I think I'm gonna go with the porcini mushrooms and boursin, s'il vous plait.",3,12
Leslie Knope,that the EagletonPawnee fence does a lot more harm than it does good.,3,12
Bertram Rolands,Hello.,3,12
Bertram Rolands,"I'm Bertram Rolands, a citizen of Eagleton.",3,12
Bertram Rolands,"With all due respect, Ms. Knope, can't you just clean up your side of the park, put some new equipment there?",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now.",3,12
Christine Porter,Hello.,3,12
Christine Porter,I'm Christine Porter.,3,12
Christine Porter,I want to respectfully say that I'm in favor of the fence.,3,12
Christine Porter,I see it as a kind of punishment for Pawnee that might inspire your town to clean up its act.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Joey, wave to the audience.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence.",3,12
Joey Plunkett,I can wave with this arm.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"No, you can't.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Both your arms are broken.,3,12
Extra,"All due respect, I recognize that boy.",3,12
Extra,He was caught selling fireworks to Eagleton kids.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town.",3,12
Leslie Knope,You cannot be sure that he is the one.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This is a perfect example of how we're going to help you.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Here's to you, Joey, and your mother and to every Pawnee citizen who might have a bright future if they fundamentally change everything about themselves.",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thanks to Leslie Knope.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I'm not done.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Isn't she trying her hardest?,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,So cute and so good.,3,12

Ann Perkins,This is a fun conversation.,3,12
Ron Swanson,Just tell me what Leslie is planning.,3,12
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I don't know.",3,12
Ann Perkins,I haven't heard anything.,3,12
Ron Swanson,Why don't you tell me what she did for your last birthday?,3,12
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, that was intense.",3,12
Ann Perkins,She totally surprised me.,3,12
Ann Perkins,"She kidnapped me from work, and then she took me to that place, Senor Vega's, you know, where the mariachi band comes out.",3,12
Ann Perkins,"They put a big sombrero on you, and then everybody sings ""Happy Birthday""?",3,12
Ron Swanson,Damn it.,3,12
Ann Perkins,"And then we went back to my house, and she invited basically everyone I knew, and she had this great guy doing face painting, and I had my face painted like a fairy tiger.",3,12
Ron Swanson,Ugh.,3,12
Ann Perkins,"Also, she did it, like, a week before my birthday, which is genius, 'cause I had no idea it was coming.",3,12
Ann Perkins,And then there was a bouncy castle.,3,12
Ann Perkins,Did you know they made those for adults?,3,12
Ron Swanson,Mmmhmm.,3,12
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll change it up this time.,3,12
Tom Haverford,Can I try the andouille sausage?,3,12

Ben Wyatt,It's disgusting.,3,12
Tom Haverford,Did you guys get your public forum gift bag?,3,12
Tom Haverford,There's an iPod touch in here.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"Man, she used to not be like this.",3,12
Leslie Knope,Eagleton really changed her.,3,12
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what exactly happened between the two of you, anyway?",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job.",3,12
Tom Haverford,And you said no? Are you insane?,3,12
Leslie Knope,"I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared.",3,12
Ben Wyatt,Wow.,3,12
Tom Haverford,Verbena-scented soy candles!,3,12
Chris Traeger,"You want me to do what, now?",3,12

Chris Traeger,Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory?,3,12
Ron Swanson,"No, it has nothing to do with her work.",3,12
Ron Swanson,I don't want to get into it.,3,12
Chris Traeger,"Ron, look, this is me, okay? You know you can talk to me about anything.",3,12
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's my birthday on Friday.",3,12
Chris Traeger,Hey! Happy Birthday.,3,12
Ron Swanson,I'm ending this right now.,3,12
Ron Swanson,I'm just gonna leave early and go home.,3,12
Ron Swanson,Unless That's exactly what she wants me to do.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody just grab a bag and open it up and then try to find some dirty stuff in there.",3,12
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?,3,12
Leslie Knope,Eagleton treats us like garbage.,3,12
Leslie Knope,We're gonna treat them like garbage.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna take these bags of trash, and we're gonna throw it over to their side of the park.",3,12
Leslie Knope,And then we're just gonna let the stink and the raccoons run wild.,3,12
Ben Wyatt,"Well, isn't that just playing right into what they think of you?",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",3,12
Leslie Knope,What am I thinking? Let's just stop this.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Put everything back in the truck.,3,12

Tom Haverford,"Wait, Leslie.",3,12
Tom Haverford,I've got this.,3,12

Tom Haverford,Take this resume and shove it into your human resources slot.,3,12
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah! Shove it there!",3,12
April Ludgate,No.,3,12
Leslie Knope,"You might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse, or whatever rich people have, but I remember something that you're trying to forget.",3,12
Leslie Knope,You're a Pawnee girl.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"No, Leslie, I'm not.",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, then why do you come here at dinnertime and get takeout from the legendary J.J's Diner?",3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's not for me.,3,12

Leslie Knope,I will never apologize to her.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Nor I her.,3,12
Leslie Knope,Nor I her.,3,12
Leslie Knope,I doth proclaim to be a stupid fart face.,3,12
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Nice retort, did G.B. Shaw write that for you?",3,12
Leslie Knope,Did G.B. Shaw write your stupid fart face?,3,12
Chief Trumple,"Ladies, if you don't apologize, we're going to have to toss the both of you in jail, so just swallow your pride say you're sorry.",3,12

Ron Swanson,"I get it, I get it, what's the point?",3,12

Ann Perkins,Hey jail bird.,3,12

Ron Swanson,"Do whatever the hell you want, what do I care?",3,12
Leslie Knope,"Right, but after, when I pressed you?",3,12
Leslie Knope,What did you say?,3,12
Ron Swanson,"I believe I said that I thought we worked well together, and that I might disagree with your philosophy but I respected you.",3,12

Leslie Knope,Eating carrots and urinating freely.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"When I walked in this morning and saw the flag was at halfmast, I thought, ""All right.""",3,16
Ron Swanson,Another bureaucrat ate it.,3,16
Ron Swanson,But then I found out it was Li'I Sebastian.,3,16
Ron Swanson,Halfmast is too high.,3,16
Ron Swanson,Show some damned respect.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"I got it, thank you.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"It's times like this, when someone or some horse passes, that you really take stock of your life.",3,16
Leslie Knope,You look around you and you start to realize what it is that you truly care about.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"For Li'l Sebastian, I imagine it was good fresh oats, a trough of water, and a willing sexual partner.",3,16
Leslie Knope,Or non-willing.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"He was a horse, so I think they had to do it either way.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,Hey.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Hey Ann, how's it going.",3,16
Ann Perkins,You don't have to pretend I know you're supposed to meet Leslie here.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,I'm also curious about how it's going.,3,16
Ann Perkins,"Leslie's busy, she's working on the Li'l Sebastian memorial service.",3,16
Ann Perkins,"But you know what, she gave me this note to give to you.",3,16
Ann Perkins,"And she also wanted me to kiss you deeply, which I'm gonna have to pass on.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,3,16
Ann Perkins,I really like my part-time job here.,3,16
Ann Perkins,"My office mate moved down the hall, so I have this whole room just for me.",3,16
Ann Perkins,"And Ben and Leslie, who secretly meet here.",3,16
Ann Perkins,40 times a day.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,She drew a kiss monster on the note.,3,16
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,3,16
Ann Perkins,"Look, you guys are totally welcome to use my office.",3,16
Ann Perkins,Just don't do anything on my desk,3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, we don't, you know, we just like to work in the same place.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,and then we talk and hold hands.,3,16
Ann Perkins,"Yuck, that's somehow worse.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it sounded bad when I said it.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"From now on, we stop mourning Li'l Sebastian's death and we start celebrating his life.",3,16
Leslie Knope,That's what he would've wanted.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"Amen, we need to send that glorious beast into the great beyond with a display that rivals the Super Bowl Halftime Show.",3,16
Ron Swanson,Also the budget is 600 dollars.,3,16
Leslie Knope,So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.,3,16
Leslie Knope,Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.,3,16
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, there's a 13th century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri that would be very appropriate.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better.",3,16
Andy Dwyer,Easy.,3,16
April Ludgate,"Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer, lead singer of Mouse Rat, you should know he doesn't get out of bed for less than $1,000.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"He sleeps on a futon, so",3,16
Leslie Knope,We can give him 50 bucks.,3,16
April Ludgate,Sold.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian.",3,16
Leslie Knope,I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,It's just a list of facts.,3,16
Leslie Knope,What?,3,16
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, mine says, ""You have a cute butt.""",3,16
Leslie Knope,That's weird.,3,16
Leslie Knope,Must be a typo.,3,16
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry, it's probably a typo, because it probably should've said, ""You have a cube butt.""",3,16
Tom Haverford,Cause your butt's shaped like a cube.,3,16
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,3,16
Jerry Gergich,"The question is, why is my memo different than everyone else's?",3,16
Leslie Knope,"Cube butt, cube butt.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Cube butt, cube butt.",3,16
Tom Haverford,"Cube butt, cube butt.",3,16
April Ludgate,"Cube butt, cube butt.",3,16
Andy Dwyer,"Cube butt, cube butt.",3,16
Dr. Harris,"Well, the good news is this is just tendonitis.",3,16
Chris Traeger,How is that good news?,3,16
Dr. Harris,The other option was shoulder cancer.,3,16
Chris Traeger,Really?,3,16
Dr. Harris,No.,3,16
Dr. Harris,"Look, you exercise a lot.",3,16
Dr. Harris,You're in great shape.,3,16
Dr. Harris,Little things like this happen with men of your age.,3,16
Chris Traeger,Men of my age?,3,16
Chris Traeger,How old do you think I am?,3,16
Dr. Harris,Fortytwo.,3,16
Chris Traeger,"I am 44, and I plan to live to be 150.",3,16
Dr. Harris,Okay.,3,16
Chris Traeger,So.,3,16
Chris Traeger,What's the cure?,3,16
Dr. Harris,Get a time machine.,3,16
Dr. Harris,Go back to being 20.,3,16
Chris Traeger,"Dr. Harris, you are literally the meanest person I have ever met.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, all the permits cleared for the horse funeral.",3,16
Ron Swanson,What was that tone?,3,16
Ben Wyatt,What?,3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,I'm very sad about this.,3,16
Tom Haverford,Question!,3,16
Tom Haverford,Who's a genius?,3,16
Tom Haverford,"Answer, Tom Haverford.",3,16
Tom Haverford,"Reason, Jean-Ralphio just started an exclusive, high end production company, and he's willing to put on Li'I Sebastian's memorial service pro bono, just for the pub.",3,16
Tom Haverford,Pub is an abbreviation for publicity.,3,16
Ron Swanson,Jean-Ralphio is a clown.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"This is the memorial for Li'I Sebastian, not double coupon night at a strip club.",3,16
Tom Haverford,"First off, double coupon night is an incredible value.",3,16
Tom Haverford,"Secondly, this guy just started a business.",3,16
Tom Haverford,He's my friend.,3,16
Tom Haverford,It would really help him out.,3,16
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything and make sure it goes great.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, we trust you.",3,16
Leslie Knope,Make us proud.,3,16
Ron Swanson,Make him proud.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just Photoshop that out?,3,16
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hi, Ann Perkins.",3,16
Ann Perkins,Hi.,3,16

Chris Traeger,I'm dying.,3,16
Ann Perkins,What?,3,16

Ann Perkins,Oh.,3,16
Ann Perkins,"I don't know if you should lead with ""I'm dying.""",3,16
Chris Traeger,"You're right, you're right.",3,16
Chris Traeger,So.,3,16
Chris Traeger,What's up with you?,3,16
Ann Perkins,I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I Sebastian's memorial service.,3,16
Chris Traeger,Li'I Sebastian died?,3,16

Ann Perkins,Like tendonitis?,3,16
Ann Perkins,I don't know.,3,16
Ann Perkins,I don't have his chart in front of me.,3,16
Chris Traeger,Could you get it?,3,16
Ann Perkins,What?,3,16
Ann Perkins,No There's no chart.,3,16
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God.",3,16

Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I'm meeting him in your office in a few minutes, how do I look?",3,16
Ann Perkins,What are you going for?,3,16

Ann Perkins,Bullseye.,3,16
Ann Perkins,It's so nice to see you so happy about a guy.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, I don't know, when I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"I mean we have to sleep around, but weirdly it's kind of fun that no one knows.",3,16
Ann Perkins,I could see that.,3,16
Leslie Knope,But enough about me.,3,16
Leslie Knope,How's Ann?,3,16
Ann Perkins,I'm pretty happy right now generally.,3,16
Ann Perkins,Although I did see Chris today.,3,16
Ann Perkins,he always just throws me off.,3,16
Leslie Knope,Don't even talk about Chris.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us.",3,16
Leslie Knope,And about how much he hurt you.,3,16
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, there you go.",3,16
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie.",3,16
Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?,3,16

Ben Wyatt,Why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?,3,16
Leslie Knope,"Because Joe from sewage had to hand out the armbands, and Perd had to fill in for Mortenson, and Mortenson had to fill in for Howser.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, why couldn't Donna do it?",3,16
Leslie Knope,Because Donna's reading Jerry's Italian poem.,3,16
Leslie Knope,This is sort of a mess.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay, we're--",3,16
Ron Swanson,"What the hell, Leslie?",3,16
Ron Swanson,I thought I was supposed to lay the ceremonial wreath.,3,16

Ben Wyatt,"Ron, congratulations.",3,16
Leslie Knope,"I saved it for you, Ron.",3,16
Ron Swanson,Who caught you guys?,3,16
Leslie Knope,"A very nosy maintenance worker, and we talked to him, and now we're all friends, and he's not gonna tell on us.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,It's totally fine.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"I think if you would know one thing about me, it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches.",3,16
Ron Swanson,I have cried twice in my life.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"Once when I was seven, and I was hit by a school bus.",3,16
Ron Swanson,And then again when I heard that Li'I Sebastian had passed.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"His memory will live on, as today we light a fire that will burn on for eternity.",3,16

Ben Wyatt,I think we got through it.,3,16

Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry, you put propane in the eternal flame, right?",3,16

Leslie Knope,Huh?,3,16
Leslie Knope,Oh!,3,16
Leslie Knope,We planned that!,3,16
Leslie Knope,"Wow, wow!",3,16
Leslie Knope,We planned that.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,Yay!,3,16
Jerry Gergich,"Please, Ron, I am very sorry.",3,16
Jerry Gergich,I guess I put too much fuel in the torch.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I don't know, Jerry.",3,16
Ron Swanson,I think you're being hard on yourself.,3,16
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, are you mad at me?",3,16
Jerry Gergich,"'Cause without eyebrows, I can't really tell.",3,16
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.,3,16
Leslie Knope,And we burned it off.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,"What, you want to break up?",3,16
Leslie Knope,What?,3,16
Leslie Knope,No.,3,16
Leslie Knope,I like you.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then You want to tell Chris.",3,16

Leslie Knope,No more secret handholding.,3,16
Leslie Knope,No more smooching in Ann's office.,3,16
Leslie Knope,"In fact, when we're at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all.",3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard, and we could still get fired.",3,16
Leslie Knope,I know.,3,16
Leslie Knope,But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,All right.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, I'm in.",3,16
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?,3,16
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?,3,16
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.,3,16
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's force of habit.",3,16
Tom Haverford,"So what do I do, Ron?",3,16
Tom Haverford,Do I stay here or roll the dice with JeanRalphio?,3,16
Tom Haverford,I can't tell you what to do.,3,16
Ron Swanson,Go with your gut.,3,16
Tom Haverford,My gut is really small and easily irritated.,3,16
Tom Haverford,I need someone to guide me.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"You have no interest in government work, and you slow everything down with your selfish attitude.",3,16
Ron Swanson,"I'd love for you to stick around, Tommy.",3,16
Ron Swanson,It'll be damn hard to replace you.,3,16
Ron Swanson,But I'll support you either way.,3,16
Tammy 2,Two of my lovers in one place.,3,16
Tammy 2,What a coincidence.,3,16
Ron Swanson,Tammy.,3,16
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron.",3,16
Tammy 2,"Ooh, what happened here?",3,16
Tammy 2,"And more importantly, does the carpet match the face?",3,16
Ron Swanson,"If you're looking for trouble, take it somewhere else.",3,16
Ron Swanson,"An hour ago, a giant fireball consumed my entire face.",3,16
Ron Swanson,And it was far preferable to spending another second with you.,3,16
Tammy 2,Tell that to your pants tent.,3,16
Ron Swanson,It's just the way I'm standing.,3,16
Ron Swanson,"Go back to the library, where you belong.",3,16

Joan Callamezzo,"What? Well, that is worse than I ever could have hoped for.",4,3
Leslie Knope,"I learned something, Joan.",4,3

Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's where all the losers are going.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what is that?",4,6
Ben Wyatt,Tom emailed me.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,I could check that out.,4,6

Ron Swanson,"I was. Lou Prozotovich, their founder, was an office supply salesman.",4,6
Ron Swanson,"One day, he had an interesting idea.",4,6
Ron Swanson,Maybe he could write a book to help people organize their offices.,4,6
Herb Scaifer,Organize It.,4,6
Ron Swanson,The book was a big success.,4,6
Ron Swanson,Then Lou had another interesting thought.,4,6
Ron Swanson,Maybe there was a 28 foot tall lizard with a volcano for a mouth who controlled the universe.,4,6
Chris Traeger,That is interesting.,4,6
Ron Swanson,So he wrote a second book.,4,6
Herb Scaifer,Organize it 2: Engage with Zorp.,4,6
Chris Traeger,"You know, can I have a look at that?",4,6
Herb Scaifer,"Well, sure you can Chris, you can keep it.",4,6
Herb Scaifer,I'd skip the first couple chapters if I were you.,4,6
Herb Scaifer,"Between you and me, it doesn't really get good until Zorp shows up.",4,6

Jerry Gergich,What?,4,6
April Ludgate,Ready!,4,6
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.,4,6
Andy Dwyer,It seems a little crazy.,4,6
Andy Dwyer,Just crazy enough to work.,4,6
April Ludgate,Aah!,4,6
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!,4,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my face!",4,6
Andy Dwyer,My face!,4,6
Andy Dwyer,"Is fine, Mikhail Petrov!",4,6
Jerry Gergich,"Forget it, Macklin, you're too late I'm sorry, guys.",4,6
April Ludgate,Jerry!,4,6
Jerry Gergich,I need my cheaters.,4,6
Jerry Gergich,I cannot see any,4,6
Andy Dwyer,"you're doing really good, you're doing really good.",4,6
Jerry Gergich,Really?,4,6
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,4,6
April Ludgate,"Help me, Agent Macklin, help me!",4,6
April Ludgate,"He's stolen my jewels, and now he's going to ravish my body and he stinks, he really stinks!",4,6
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, Janet Snakehole belongs to mother Russia now.",4,6

Ron Swanson,By the late Lou Prozotovich.,4,6
Ron Swanson,Reminder.,4,6
Ron Swanson,These flutes are available for purchase.,4,6
Ron Swanson,You can't take it with you people.,4,6
Chris Traeger,"Herb, I just speedread both of your books.",4,6
Herb Scaifer,Ooh.,4,6
Chris Traeger,"And, full disclosure, I think they're bonkersfilled.",4,6
Chris Traeger,But I did notice that you're interested in reincarnation.,4,6
Chris Traeger,Tell me about that.,4,6
Herb Scaifer,"Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?",4,6
Herb Scaifer,"From the universe, we emerge.",4,6
Herb Scaifer,"Into the universe, we return.",4,6
Herb Scaifer,And there are infinite forms we can take in infinite universes.,4,6
Chris Traeger,What a lovely thought.,4,6
Herb Scaifer,"Well, this morning at dawn, you will take a new form.",4,6
Herb Scaifer,"That of a fleshless, chattering skeleton when Zorp the surveyor arrives and burns your flesh off with his volcano mouth.",4,6
Chris Traeger,That was very strange what you just said.,4,6
Chris Traeger,I don't like it as much as that other thing you said.,4,6
Herb Scaifer,Oh.,4,6
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, where you going?",4,6
Leslie Knope,Where you headed off to?,4,6
Leslie Knope,Do you want to play a fun game with me that I made up called chessrisk?,4,6

Ben Wyatt,"Okay, yeah, I think I'm gonna go.",4,6
Leslie Knope,I okay.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,All right?,4,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!",4,6

Leslie Knope,I forgot I have a thing I need to show you.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,Oh.,4,6
Leslie Knope,I need to bring you there right now it's so amazing.,4,6
Leslie Knope,It's going to freak you out.,4,6
Leslie Knope,"It's, uh, it's something that we need to get in my car and go to, so let's do that.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,4,6
Leslie Knope,Come on.,4,6
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, where are you going?",4,6
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the thing that I told you about with Ben.,4,6
Leslie Knope,"No spoilers, Ann.",4,6
Leslie Knope,She's been there before.,4,6
Leslie Knope,Let's go.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,4,6
Tom Haverford,"What's up, what's up?",4,6
Tom Haverford,Are you guys having a good time tonight?,4,6
Tom Haverford,I think we've gotta take things to the next level.,4,6
Tom Haverford,"Drum line, hit it!",4,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Here we go, here we go.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,We've already been down this street.,4,6
Leslie Knope,"Just out of curiosity, where's your favorite place to go like ever?",4,6
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't know.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,Tom's party sounded kind of fun.,4,6
Leslie Knope,Here we are!,4,6
Leslie Knope,We're at the special place!,4,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, here we are.",4,6
Leslie Knope,What do you think?,4,6
Ben Wyatt,Are you gonna murder me and bury me at this gas station?,4,6
Leslie Knope,"No, this is a great gas station.",4,6
Leslie Knope,This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.,4,6
Leslie Knope,"I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M.",4,6
Leslie Knope,"Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman.",4,6
Leslie Knope,"Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,When he was 8.,4,6
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I just knew you were a big fan of financial records, so, you're welcome.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,"I know what you're doing, Leslie.",4,6
Leslie Knope,I'm showing you a part of Rock and Roll history.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,You you can't do this.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,You know we broke up.,4,6
Ben Wyatt,"And I kind of feel like we shouldn't Hang out together, just the two of us.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,"Because every time we do, it just makes it harder.",4,6
Ben Wyatt,You know?,4,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,4,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,4,6
Andy Dwyer,This one would get me arrested and this other one's impossible.,4,6
Andy Dwyer,because we need Eddie Vedder and a time machine.,4,6
Andy Dwyer,I think we've done everything on the list that we can actually do.,4,6
April Ludgate,Really?,4,6
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's it.",4,6
April Ludgate,What about this?,4,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, that would be awesome.",4,6
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible.,4,6
April Ludgate,"No, it isn't.",4,6
April Ludgate,"We have $1,000 in our bank account, and we're young and irresponsible.",4,6
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, our car would break down.",4,6
Andy Dwyer,There's no way we could even get there.,4,6
April Ludgate,So I'll steal my dad's car.,4,6
April Ludgate,"Look, this is a stupid idea, but right at this exact second, we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it is.",4,6
Andy Dwyer,You are absolutely right.,4,6
Andy Dwyer,"No thinking, just stupid.",4,6
April Ludgate,Yes!,4,6
Chris Traeger,Buddhists feel that human beings are unlikely to be reincarnated as human beings.,4,6
Chris Traeger,So the problem with reincarnation is that you could be reborn as a pretzel.,4,6
Chris Traeger,Or a socket wrench.,4,6
Chris Traeger,"Ron, if you could be reincarnated, what would you like to be?",4,6
Ron Swanson,"Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually.",4,6
Ann Perkins,I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one you're in now.,4,6
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins that was beautiful.,4,6
Chris Traeger,Let's go to that party that Tom's having.,4,6
Chris Traeger,Have some fun in this life.,4,6
Ann Perkins,Sounds good.,4,6
Ron Swanson,"Wait, I want to change my answer, I'll go with bolt cutters.",4,6
Ann Perkins,Maybe you'll be reincarnated as a good dancer.,4,6
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, you zinged me. I love that.",4,6
Donna Meagle,This is the best party I've ever been to.,4,6
Donna Meagle,And I'm not just saying that.,4,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"For real, T.T., think about it man.",4,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Drum lines, personalized gift bags, tigers.",4,6
Tom Haverford,It's pretty great.,4,6
Tom Haverford,But it's not perfect.,4,6
Tom Haverford,I mean David Beckham didn't show up.,4,6
Donna Meagle,You knew that one was a long shot.,4,6
Donna Meagle,"Honestly, this is perfect.",4,6
Tom Haverford,I guess.,4,6
Lucy,Tom.,4,6
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Lucy, what are you doing here?",4,6

Ben Wyatt,"But I can't, okay?",4,7
Ben Wyatt,"Now, we agreed the other night that we can't spend time together.",4,7

Leslie Knope,But that was in a romantic way.,4,7
Leslie Knope,We can still spend time together as friends.,4,7

Ben Wyatt,You can't just chop up the aspects of a relationship into discrete parts and select the ones you want like a buffet.,4,7
Leslie Knope,Why not?,4,7
Ben Wyatt,Because it's selfish.,4,7
Ben Wyatt,Stop being obtuse.,4,7
Leslie Knope,"Look, I understand where he's coming from.",4,7
Leslie Knope,"But I have been nothing but straightforward with him, and if anyone in the entire world should understand the difficult position I'm in, it's It's just I've made an effort and I've shared my flags with him, and suddenly, he doesn't want to be friends?",4,7

Leslie Knope,What does that all mean?,4,8
Ann Perkins,I think you know what it means.,4,8
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,4,8
Leslie Knope,I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.,4,8
Ann Perkins,That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.,4,8
Leslie Knope,"No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year.",4,8
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, for God's sakes.",4,8
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann.",4,8

Leslie Knope,As well as your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.,4,8
Leslie Knope,"As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together.",4,8
Leslie Knope,"So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070.",4,8
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting.",4,8

Ann Perkins,He said to look at the monster.,4,9
Ann Perkins,I'm hoping you know what that means.,4,9
Ron Swanson,There's a rumor going around that Chris has a killer witness.,4,9
Leslie Knope,How?,4,9
Leslie Knope,Why?,4,9
Leslie Knope,That makes no sense.,4,9
Leslie Knope,"There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong unless someone's planning to lie or slander us.",4,9
Leslie Knope,"Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him.",4,9
Ron Swanson,With pleasure.,4,9

Pete Disellio,"Look, Leslie, I read up on you.",4,11

Leslie Knope,Let's not talk about dunking anymore.,4,11
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about what you want to do.,4,11
Pete Disellio,Okay.,4,11
Leslie Knope,I think you want to dunk.,4,11
Pete Disellio,I'm not going to dunk the ball.,4,11
Ann Perkins,What about a layup?,4,11
Ron Swanson,"Officer, I've been operating heavy machinery since I was eight years old.",4,11
Ron Swanson,"Now, I respect you and your service to this town and your country, but what laws are we breaking exactly?",4,11
Police Officer,"Well, you got four people in the front seat, nobody's wearing a seat belt, you were speeding and blasting your horn through the hospital zone, the rear of the vehicle's open, debris has been falling out, and you don't have a commercial license to drive a truck.",4,11
Ron Swanson,Okay.,4,11
Ron Swanson,"Well, we have a philosophical difference on what constitutes a law.",4,11
Police Officer,"I need to see your hands and could you step out of the vehicle, please?",4,11
April Ludgate,Hi.,4,11
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to know we're about to be arrested.,4,11
Ann Perkins,"Oh my God, April, that's horrible.",4,11

Leslie Knope,Do not make any trouble.,4,11
Leslie Knope,Sit tight.,4,11
Leslie Knope,I'm on my way.,4,11
Ann Perkins,Whoa.,4,11
Ann Perkins,You just hung up on her?,4,11
Leslie Knope,She'd already hung up on me.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me.",4,11
Leslie Knope,You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.,4,11
Ann Perkins,"Okay, but if I don't, it's no big deal, right?",4,11
Ann Perkins,You'll just make your speech?,4,11
Leslie Knope,He's our surprise headliner.,4,11
Leslie Knope,The whole town loves him.,4,11
Leslie Knope,I'm polling at 1%.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"He must dunk, Ann.",4,11
Leslie Knope,Do whatever it takes.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"You know, anything short of sexual favors.",4,11
Ann Perkins,What?,4,11
Leslie Knope,"I do not I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors.",4,11
Ann Perkins,I wasn't going to.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Good, I wouldn't either.",4,11
Leslie Knope,That's where I draw the line.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me.",4,11
Ann Perkins,Go.,4,11
Leslie Knope,Right.,4,11
Chris Traeger,"So, Ben",4,11
Chris Traeger,Why Calzone?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"Glad you asked, Chris.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,"You know, there's fast food hamburgers.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Mexican.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Chinese.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,Blah blah blah.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,Have you ever wondered why there isn't a fast food option for Italian food?,4,11
Chris Traeger,What about pizza?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,Pizza?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,Never heard of it.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.,4,11
Chris Traeger,Never thought of it that way.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.,4,11
Chris Traeger,Amazing.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,And you of all people will like this.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna use low fat ingredients.,4,11
Chris Traeger,Gamechanger.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery ""The Lowcal Calzone Zone.""",4,11
Chris Traeger,That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.,4,11
Chris Traeger,That idea is terrible.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Glen, you're killing me.",4,11
Police Officer,"They broke about 50 laws, Knope.",4,11
Police Officer,"And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice homecooked meal, and do what comes naturally.",4,11
Police Officer,That's not appropriate.,4,11
Leslie Knope,You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"I need them, please.",4,11
Police Officer,Fine.,4,11
Police Officer,"But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck.",4,11
Ann Perkins,It would just mean so much to us.,4,11
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're a living legend.",4,11
Ann Perkins,They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.,4,11
Pete Disellio,"Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a doubleedged sword.",4,11
Pete Disellio,"Everybody in this town still calls me ""Pistol.""",4,11
Ann Perkins,"Tell me more about that, Peter.",4,11
Pete Disellio,"I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you.",4,11
Chris Traeger,"Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?",4,11
Chris Traeger,"Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going?",4,11
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, thanks, Chris.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.,4,11
Chris Traeger,"You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here.",4,11
Chris Traeger,I think getting some perspective would be good.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?,4,11
Chris Traeger,I've known you a long time.,4,11
Chris Traeger,"And, right now, you need help.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,With my Claymaish?,4,11
Chris Traeger,With your life.,4,11
Chris Traeger,"You are wildly, insanely depressed.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,Depressed?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,I'm the furthest thing from depressed.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look at what I've accomplished.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,Do you see him?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,Do you think a depressed person could make this?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,No.,4,11
Ron Swanson,That's all we can fit in here.,4,11
Leslie Knope,No problem.,4,11
Leslie Knope,This is going to be fine.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do.",4,11
April Ludgate,"Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom.",4,11
Andy Dwyer,Oh!,4,11
Andy Dwyer,He shall do it in the car!,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Answer your phone, Ann.",4,11
Pete Disellio,That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.,4,11
Pete Disellio,"Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline.",4,11
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,I'm not faffing around.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,I've sunk myself into my hobbies.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay?",4,11
Ben Wyatt,"Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, and I think it's really good.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,"So just hang on to your hat, okay?",4,11
Ben Wyatt,Here it goes.,4,11
Chris Traeger,"Oh, how great.",4,11
Chris Traeger,Did you pause it?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"No, I hang on.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,That's the whole thing.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,That's three weeks of work.,4,11
Chris Traeger,You're gonna be okay.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, I'm not.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,"You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool.",4,11
Ben Wyatt,"I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer?",4,11
Chris Traeger,"Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame.",4,11
Chris Traeger,But we are going to get through this.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no word from Ann.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"April, I need a status report.",4,11
Leslie Knope,How's it looking out there?,4,11
April Ludgate,"Perfect, but just one thing.",4,11
April Ludgate,It's not a basketball court any more.,4,11
April Ludgate,It's an ice skating rink.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?",4,11
Leslie Knope,Why?,4,11
Leslie Knope,What happened?,4,11
April Ludgate,The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.,4,11
April Ludgate,"Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how's the stage coming?",4,11
Ron Swanson,"Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?",4,11
Andy Dwyer,"We had to ""Jetsons"" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house.",4,11
Tom Haverford,Wow.,4,11
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I got Pistol Pete.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"Good, where is he?",4,11
Ann Perkins,"Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work.",4,11
Ann Perkins,"I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation.",4,11
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, the important news is that he's here.",4,11
Leslie Knope,Good.,4,11
Leslie Knope,Is he going to dunk for me?,4,11
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying.",4,11
Leslie Knope,He's crying?,4,11
Ann Perkins,"No, I was crying.",4,11
Ann Perkins,"It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"We should cancel it, right?",4,11
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should cancel it?,4,11
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,4,11
Leslie Knope,Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here.",4,11
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, first of all, I don't like it when you guys use that term.",4,11
Jerry Gergich,"But for the record, I came through.",4,11
Jerry Gergich,There are almost a hundred people out there!,4,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?",4,11
April Ludgate,"Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry?",4,11
Leslie Knope,"I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem.",4,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, everybody listen up.",4,11
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to say thank you.,4,11
Leslie Knope,"You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it.",4,11

Leslie Knope,"You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar.",4,11
Tom Haverford,That would be Hurley's.,4,11
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's karaoke tonight!",4,11
April Ludgate,Yes!,4,11
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, guys.",4,11
Ann Perkins,No.,4,11
Ann Perkins,"We're not leaving, okay? We're the reason Leslie's in this mess.",4,11

Ben Wyatt,Oh.,4,11
Ben Wyatt,Tastes like a belt.,4,11
Chris Traeger,"I know, isn't it awful? But it works wonderfully.",4,11
Chris Traeger,"So, tell me.",4,11
Chris Traeger,Do you admit that you're depressed?,4,11
Ben Wyatt,How did you know? I didn't even know.,4,11
Chris Traeger,"The Letters to Cleo t-shirt, the unshaven face, the Doc Martins, and your hair does not have that normal, uptight, rigid, inflexible Ben Wyatt sense of fun.",4,11

Chris Traeger,"Herbal smoothie, you have done it again.",4,11

April Ludgate,You don't know that.,4,14
Leslie Knope,Why wouldn't she tell me who it is?,4,14
Leslie Knope,Because she doesn't want me to know.,4,14
Leslie Knope,Because it's someone she shouldn't be dating.,4,14

Leslie Knope,"Chris needs to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date.",4,14
Leslie Knope,"I mean, so many injustices.",4,14
April Ludgate,"Ann would never do anything to piss you off, Leslie.",4,14

Leslie Knope,"Yes, but I have to tell you something.",4,14
Leslie Knope,Chris and Ann are on a secret date.,4,14
Leslie Knope,"Which is crazy because he's her boss, which is the exact situation we were in, except we were put on trial for it.",4,14
Leslie Knope,"And I know I'm not supposed to care, and I'm supposed to let it go, and we should just have a romantic dinner",4,14
Ben Wyatt,"No, we have to go catch them in the act.",4,14

April Ludgate,Because I set them up.,4,14
April Ludgate,I was watching Ann with Tom at the dance and she seemed to be having a good time.,4,14
April Ludgate,So I went over to talk to her.,4,14
April Ludgate,What are you looking for in a date anyway?,4,14
Ann Perkins,I don't know.,4,14
Ann Perkins,"What does anyone want? Just a nice, funny guy who likes me and treats me well.",4,14
April Ludgate,"Tom's funny, and he'd treat you well.",4,14
Ann Perkins,"Ha, ha.",4,14
April Ludgate,I'm serious.,4,14
April Ludgate,"You want a good date, why not ask out the only guy that's made you smile tonight?",4,14

Ann Perkins,All that dumb swagger.,4,14

April Ludgate,He's sweet.,4,14
April Ludgate,You should just ask him out for a drink.,4,14
April Ludgate,"I'm 1,000% sure he'd say yes.",4,14
April Ludgate,I bet you guys would have a good time.,4,14
Ben Wyatt,"Man, I need to, like, wrap my head around this.",4,14
April Ludgate,Why? It makes sense to me.,4,14
April Ludgate,"This is a small, loser town with loser people, and Tom's, like, at least semi-cool.",4,14
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm hearing? You tried to make Ann happy for Valentine's Day.,4,14
April Ludgate,Ugh.,4,14

Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I love passionate speakers and Italian men.",4,14
Leslie Knope,Doesn't mean I love Mussolini.,4,14
Ben Wyatt,You love Italian men?,4,14
Leslie Knope,Not as much as Irish Scottish? White whatever you are.,4,14
Leslie Knope,This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.,4,14
Tom Haverford,"So, Ann, it's finally happening.",4,14
Ann Perkins,"Dude, this is so close to falling apart.",4,14
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry.",4,14
Tom Haverford,"Can I be honest, though? I'm a little freaked out.",4,14
Tom Haverford,"Like, I don't really understand what's going on.",4,14
Ann Perkins,"This is what's going on, we're gonna have a drink, and we're gonna talk, get to know each other.",4,14
Ann Perkins,And then I am going to drive home alone.,4,14
Tom Haverford,Cool.,4,14
Tom Haverford,"Consider this alternate plan, we have drinks here, get to know each other, whatever.",4,14
Tom Haverford,Then we go back to my place and snuggle up Like little bunnies.,4,14
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, this was a mistake.",4,14
Tom Haverford,No!,4,14
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, thanks to your annoying prying last year, I'm sure you remember my birthday's coming up.",4,14

Leslie Knope,The scavenger hunt?,4,14
Ron Swanson,I also do not want that.,4,14
Leslie Knope,"Yep, I understand.",4,14
Ron Swanson,"I absolutely do not want to solve a series of riddles and clues, each more intricate than the last.",4,14
Ron Swanson,You understand what I'm saying?,4,14
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I got it, Ron.",4,14
Ron Swanson,Good.,4,14

Andy Dwyer,Aww.,4,16
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that I screwed up your birthday party.",4,16
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that's okay.",4,16
Leslie Knope,But we all pitched in.,4,16
Leslie Knope,And we are sending you and Gayle to a B&B in your favorite place in the world.,4,16
Jerry Gergich,Muncie?,4,16
Leslie Knope,"Amazingly, yes.",4,16
Leslie Knope,"Muncie, Indiana.",4,16

Perd Hapley,Is Bobby Newport's campaign for city council in trouble?,4,17
Perd Hapley,"When I say your names, I want you to respond.",4,17
Perd Hapley,Dylan.,4,17
Extra,"Well, Newport's poll numbers have been plummeting.",4,17
Extra,"They just fired his campaign manager, and where's Bobby?",4,17
Extra,He's on vacation in Spain.,4,17
Extra,"He's not on vacation, he's in hiding.",4,17
Extra,"Every time the guy speaks, he puts his foot in his mouth.",4,17
Perd Hapley,That's a hilarious image.,4,17
Perd Hapley,A foot in a mouth.,4,17
Extra,It's a common expression.,4,17
Perd Hapley,Okay.,4,17
Perd Hapley,"According to the newest polls, Leslie knope is now in second place.",4,17
Perd Hapley,She's just 15 points back.,4,17
Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, yeah!",4,17
Perd Hapley,How did she close the gap?,4,17
Extra,"You have to give a lot of credit to her campaign manager, Ben Wyatt.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass.",4,17
Leslie Knope,Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Every move he's made has worked.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,What did you just say?,4,17
Leslie Knope,Nothing.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Keep up the good work.,4,17
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Senior citizens are basically the only people who vote in local elections, so if you want to win, you gotta get the gray vote.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones.",4,17
Leslie Knope,He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.,4,17
Leslie Knope,He's like The Godfather but old.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,He's like The Grandfather.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,The Grand Godfather.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"The ""grond"" father, he's like It doesn't matter.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"He's important, and he's old.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Jones, such a pleasure to meet you.",4,17
Leslie Knope,Please don't get up.,4,17
Ned Jones,Don't worry.,4,17
Ned Jones,I can't.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Oh.,4,17
Ned Jones,Just joking.,4,17
Ned Jones,I can get up.,4,17
Ned Jones,But it's difficult.,4,17
Ned Jones,"But I can do it, but it is hard.",4,17
Ned Jones,"Look, I don't have a lot of time.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,Is it cancer?,4,17
Ned Jones,"No, I don't have a lot of time before my swim aerobics.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,Oh.,4,17
Ned Jones,Why are you better for seniors than Bobby Newport?,4,17
Leslie Knope,Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind ""everything hurts"" and ""I'm dying.""",4,17
Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me.,4,17
Ron Swanson,Good God.,4,17
Ron Swanson,What the hell are you doing?,4,17
Chris Traeger,Upsidedown situps.,4,17
Chris Traeger,"Great exercise, and it literally lets me see the world from a different perspective.",4,17
Ron Swanson,Isn't there a men's gymnasium where you could do that?,4,17
Chris Traeger,"The world's my gymnasium, Ron.",4,17
Chris Traeger,But I will stop if it makes you uncomfortable.,4,17
Chris Traeger,Could you hold me while I dismount?,4,17
Chris Traeger,Thanks so much.,4,17
Ron Swanson,You bet.,4,17
Chris Traeger,Question for you.,4,17
Chris Traeger,"In a town of this size, the Parks department traditionally has ten employees.",4,17
Chris Traeger,You have only seven.,4,17
Chris Traeger,Why is that?,4,17
Ron Swanson,I work hard to make sure my department is as small and ineffective as possible.,4,17
Chris Traeger,The department is so small because Leslie Knope singlehandedly does the work of four people.,4,17
Chris Traeger,And she's already scaled back her time.,4,17
Chris Traeger,"If she wins, she'll be dividing her time between Parks and City Council.",4,17
Chris Traeger,I'm going to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack.,4,17
Ron Swanson,No!,4,17
Ron Swanson,"Chris, that's unnecessary.",4,17
Ron Swanson,The department is doing fine without Leslie.,4,17
Chris Traeger,Then prove it.,4,17
Chris Traeger,Complete one major project.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"Either we complete a government project which is abhorrent to me, or we bring a new person into the department, which repulses me to my core.",4,17
Ron Swanson,Reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my sixth birthday.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them.",4,17
Ron Swanson,And they were delicious.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Essentially, we're going to put a ramp on every building in town.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game.",4,17
Ned Jones,Damn straight.,4,17
Ned Jones,This is very impressive.,4,17
Ned Jones,"You know, you remind me of my brother.",4,17
Ned Jones,"You have the same name, Leslie.",4,17
Ned Jones,He lost a third of his body in a motorcycle accident.,4,17
Ned Jones,The middle third.,4,17
Ned Jones,But they sutured the hell out of him.,4,17
Ned Jones,He's he's fine now.,4,17
Ned Jones,"Much shorter, but a goodlooking, young, flat man.",4,17
Ned Jones,"What have you heard about Newport's new campaign manager, Jennifer Barkley?",4,17
Leslie Knope,"Uh, who?",4,17
Ned Jones,She wants to have a meeting with me at 5:00.,4,17
Ned Jones,I told her sorry.,4,17
Ned Jones,I don't talk politics after dinner.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, she worked with James Carville?",4,17
Ben Wyatt,She ran two Republican congressional campaigns and a Senate race.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and check out this picture.",4,17
Leslie Knope,She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.,4,17
Leslie Knope,That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Why are you smiling?,4,17
Leslie Knope,Why is this terrifying information making you smile?,4,17
Ben Wyatt,Newport's scared.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he must've shelled out a fortune to hire her.",4,17
Leslie Knope,So what do we do next?,4,17
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to set up a meeting.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we can size her up, but more importantly, it'll humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,And we'll do it at JJ's Diner.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,Home field advantage.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body.",4,17
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann Perkins.",4,17
Ann Perkins,This is the first time you've said my entire name correctly.,4,17
Ron Swanson,Nonsense.,4,17
Ron Swanson,We are close friends.,4,17
Ron Swanson,I have good news for you.,4,17
Ron Swanson,I'm making the water fountain hygiene upgrade our number one priority.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Oh, great.",4,17
Ann Perkins,"For some reason, when people in Pawnee use the water fountain, they put their mouths completely over the spouts.",4,17
Ann Perkins,"It's like this weird, disgusting, local quirk.",4,17
Ann Perkins,"Kiss one water fountain drinker, you're kissing everyone in Pawnee.",4,17
Ann Perkins,Including him.,4,17
Ron Swanson,I'd like to complete this project by tomorrow.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Oh.,4,17
Ron Swanson,Set up shop in our office.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"In fact, take Leslie's desk.",4,17
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I will.",4,17
Ann Perkins,Thanks.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Great.,4,17
April Ludgate,Do you want the door open or shut?,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Ah, open's fine.",4,17
April Ludgate,Okay.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Marta.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone.",4,17

Jennifer Barkley,Hi.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Hi.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Grab a seat.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry about all these papers.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I had them shipped in.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I'm a news junkie.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,Is this in Arabic?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, I've been reading up on you two.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Ben, it's a great job on this campaign.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,Oh.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"And Leslie, your Parks work, it's no joke.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,This is federal government caliber.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Not to sound rude, but what are you doing here?",4,17
Ben Wyatt,This campaign seems beneath you.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's daddy called me out of the blue.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"I'd never heard of Bobby Newport before, but it became clear in two seconds this guy is a moron.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"So I was, like, ""sorry, Nick.""",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Your son is a moron.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,There's no way.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,""" Then he offered me a crazy amount of money.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I shouldn't even tell you how much.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,But I will.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"$250,000.00 ",4,17
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,For six weeks of work?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I know.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Plus frankly, I needed a break from Washington.",4,17
Leslie Knope,Do you know Joe Biden?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, mmhmm.",4,17
Leslie Knope,He's on my celebrity sex list.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Well, he is my celebrity sex list.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, trust me.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,You can do better than Joe.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no.",4,17
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think I can.,4,17
Leslie Knope,No way.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, man.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I knew I shouldn't have met you guys.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Now I kind of hope you win.,4,17
Leslie Knope,She's just doing this for the money.,4,17
Leslie Knope,She doesn't even like her own client.,4,17
Leslie Knope,This could be the best case scenario for us.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.,4,17
Perd Hapley,Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God.",4,17
Leslie Knope,What?,4,17
Perd Hapley,"Wow, strong words from a powerful lady.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,So I guess we both agree.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is wrong for Pawnee.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario!,4,17
Extra,"I'm Leslie Knope and when I grow up, I want to be a unicorn princess or a city councilor.",4,17
Extra,Wrong.,4,17
Extra,"Not in my town, kid.",4,17
Extra,City council's a real job for a real adult.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,It's playing every hour on every channel.,4,17
Leslie Knope,It's official.,4,17
Leslie Knope,I hate Jennifer Barkley.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't let Barkley knock us off message.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,"We are going there to get Ned Jones' endorsement, and that's huge.",4,17
Leslie Knope,You're right.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,Do you wish I were taller or what's going on?,4,17
Leslie Knope,Nothing.,4,17
Leslie Knope,You're perfect.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Okay, everyone.",4,17
Ann Perkins,So the Health department is working on a poster campaign to warn people about diseases.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Now we are going to build a better water fountain for the parks.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Andy is our official waterfountain tester.,4,17
Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's give this sucker a testdrive.",4,17
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that to.",4,17
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that's good.",4,17
Ann Perkins,"Okay, any ideas?",4,17
Ann Perkins,Jerry?,4,17
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I was thinking that we could put this cage thing around it.",4,17
Ann Perkins,Okay.,4,17
Ann Perkins,That could work.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Andy?,4,17
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Andy.",4,17
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, still good.",4,17
Ann Perkins,Tom?,4,17
Tom Haverford,Full disclosure.,4,17
Tom Haverford,Ann and I are romantically intertwined.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God.",4,17
Tom Haverford,So let's not be surprised if she picks my idea.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Would you just go, dummy?",4,17
Tom Haverford,What's the best kind of water fountain?,4,17
Tom Haverford,How about no water fountain?,4,17
Tom Haverford,This is the Voss Water Butler by Tumi.,4,17
Tom Haverford,And only $600 a bag.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"April, what's your idea?",4,17
April Ludgate,To go in that room and finish this book.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Oh, really?",4,17
April Ludgate,Yeah.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Is it good?,4,17
April Ludgate,Yeah.,4,17
Ann Perkins,"You're going to stay here, and you're going to help.",4,17
Ann Perkins,Donna?,4,17
Donna Meagle,Do I look like I drink water?,4,17
Leslie Knope,Yoohoo.,4,17
Leslie Knope,I'm over here.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Just about to start my presentation.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"I uhoh, stairs.",4,17
Leslie Knope,What do I do?,4,17
Leslie Knope,How do I get from here to there?,4,17
Leslie Knope,I'm not a professional mountain climber.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game.",4,17
Extra,Yeah.,4,17
Extra,Ramps are an idiot's game.,4,17
Extra,This is nothing more than a worse version of Bobby Newport's plan.,4,17
Leslie Knope,What plan?,4,17
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Was somebody just talking about Bobby Newport's plan?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Because Ned Jones and I would love to share it with you.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on out here, Ned.",4,17
Ned Jones,Ned Jones is here.,4,17
Ned Jones,Say hello to Ned Jones.,4,17
Ned Jones,Make way for Ned Jones.,4,17
Donna Meagle,Why don't we just turn up the pressure?,4,17
Donna Meagle,That way you don't have to put your mouth so close.,4,17
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go.",4,17
April Ludgate,"Ah, stop!",4,17
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm sorry.",4,17
Ann Perkins,That'll teach you to pay attention.,4,17
April Ludgate,I have an idea.,4,17
April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking, ""what if we did ""something like this?",4,17
Ann Perkins,""" Oh, my dude, what the hell?",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport's plan is called ""Rise Up!",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Pawnee.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,""" He is going to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Wow.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Now you could use a ramp, but that seems like a lot of work.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport thinks that the stairs should do the work for you, don't you agree?",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Give him a hand.,4,17
Ned Jones,"As President of Seniors United, I endorse Bobby Newport.",4,17
Chris Traeger,I've started meeting with people to fill in for Leslie.,4,17
Chris Traeger,I have found five candidates I'd like to hire and two I'd like to be lifelong friends with.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"Well, you will not be hiring anyone because my department is just finishing up a major project.",4,17
Andy Dwyer,Incoming!,4,17
Andy Dwyer,Got you!,4,17
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, don't!",4,17
Chris Traeger,Excuse me.,4,17
Tom Haverford,"Help, everything I'm wearing is suede!",4,17
Tom Haverford,"Everything I'm wearing is suede, everything I'm wearing is suede!",4,17
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, everybody.",4,17
Ron Swanson,Attention!,4,17
Chris Traeger,I think you'll agree that this department could use a little leadership.,4,17
Andy Dwyer,Kamikaze!,4,17
Jerry Gergich,Oh.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"""Stumbling for the first time in months, ""the Knope campaign seems to be rolling down ""a ramp to nowhere.",4,17
Leslie Knope,""" We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country.",4,17
Leslie Knope,He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I wish I was better at this.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,Then you could be making out with some floozy in Majorca.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,Maybe we take the fight to her?,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea.",4,17
Leslie Knope,That sounds good.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just do that.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,"I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there.",4,17
April Ludgate,Hey.,4,17
April Ludgate,Chris wants you in his office for the final round of interviews.,4,17
April Ludgate,And sorry we goofed around so much.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"Normally, I'd be very proud of you for what you did.",4,17
Ron Swanson,This is a rare example where wasting a full day of work is a bad thing.,4,17
April Ludgate,"Is there really going to be a weird, new person in the office?",4,17
Ron Swanson,I think so.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"We may be in for a good, old fashioned shakeup.",4,17
Leslie Knope,Jennifer Barkley.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"You twofaced, carpetbagging",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, Leslie.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Good to see you.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Hi, nice to see you, too.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"You are a twofaced, carpet",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,You want anything?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Anything?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,It's on me.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Everything in this town is so cheap.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"I would never accept anything from a twofaced, carpetbagging",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Please.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Let me get my insults out.,4,17
Leslie Knope,I've been practicing it the whole way over here.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I sense that you're angry.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Tell me why.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts.",4,17
Leslie Knope,My idea is better.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, I don't doubt it.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,The fact is I don't care.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan I don't actually care about any of this.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just trying to win.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, it's not personal.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I like you.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,But my job is to beat you.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,So have a seat.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I'll get you some of those waffles you love.,4,17
Leslie Knope,How do you know that,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,It's my job to know.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"God, you're good.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I know.,4,17
Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys.",4,17
Chris Traeger,What's so imporant?,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Well, after yesterday's hands on brainstorming session",4,17
Chris Traeger,Water balloon fight.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Fair enough.,4,17
Ann Perkins,We think we came up with a fountain idea that really works.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Presenting the amazing spoutless fountain.,4,17
Andy Dwyer,Huh?,4,17
Andy Dwyer,What?,4,17
April Ludgate,"We just removed the splash guard because if it's not there, you can't put your mouth on it.",4,17
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll I'll try it.",4,17
Andy Dwyer,I did it.,4,17
April Ludgate,"Good job, babe.",4,17
Chris Traeger,"Simple, elegant, and costeffective.",4,17
Chris Traeger,"If your team keeps this up, I think we can hold off on filling the Leslie void.",4,17
Donna Meagle,I think Ben's already filling the Leslie void.,4,17
Donna Meagle,Oh!,4,17
Ann Perkins,Oh!,4,17
Chris Traeger,I'll give it up for that.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,So what's Ben's next move for you?,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, let me guess.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Um, you're going to attack me.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Perd,"" first of all, and no.",4,17
Leslie Knope,Maybe.,4,17
Leslie Knope,No.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,That's not a terrible idea.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea",4,17
Leslie Knope,Which you did.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goodygoody nerd.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Because you know what people don't care about?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,They don't care about whose idea was first.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,They care about whose idea was best.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Mmhmm, okay.",4,17
Leslie Knope,What would you do instead?,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Leslie.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Right.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Ah, what the hell.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, ""you can never spend too much on seniors.""",4,17
Leslie Knope,Of course.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,You need to beat our idea.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Come up with something better.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I don't know.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"All right, that could work.",4,17
Leslie Knope,Wow.,4,17
Extra,Waffles and a cappuccino.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Gracias, Marta.",4,17
Leslie Knope,JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, it does now.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I bought them one.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Course you did.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,You talked to Barkley without me?,4,17
Leslie Knope,I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.,4,17
Leslie Knope,And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager.",4,17
Leslie Knope,But what if she's right?,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Well, what if it's a trick?",4,17
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it.",4,17
Leslie Knope,But she knows that I know that she knows that She's in our heads.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,She's better at this than I am.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,Really?,4,17
Leslie Knope,Yes.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?",4,17
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Okay.,4,17
Ron Swanson,I'd like to talk about your future.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Why are we on this bench?,4,17
Ann Perkins,This is weird.,4,17
Ron Swanson,You did a great job solving that problem today.,4,17
Ron Swanson,The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinking,4,17
Ann Perkins,I didn't solve that problem.,4,17
Ann Perkins,April did.,4,17
Ron Swanson,Really?,4,17
Ron Swanson,Why did she tell me you did?,4,17
Ann Perkins,"Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something.",4,17
Ann Perkins,"If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer.",4,17
Ron Swanson,Perhaps you're right.,4,17
Ann Perkins,Should I go?,4,17
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you're still here?",4,17
Ron Swanson,Yes.,4,17
Perd Hapley,Let's begin the show by starting it.,4,17
Perd Hapley,"Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh They did, they stole our idea.",4,17
Leslie Knope,We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Perd.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,This is politics as usual.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"There she goes again, Perd.",4,17
Perd Hapley,I don't know where she went the first time.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport cares about better, not cheaper for our seniors.",4,17
Perd Hapley,And our flash poll seems to agree.,4,17
Perd Hapley,Some 78% of those we surveyed prefer the Newport plan to the Knope plan.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,This is why Ned Jones has endorsed us.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Let's get back on track.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I just think our opposition is losing sight of what all this is about.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about.",4,17
Leslie Knope,What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Excuse me?,4,17
Leslie Knope,"Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads.",4,17
Leslie Knope,It was in the Pawnee papers.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's personal life is neither here nor there.,4,17
Leslie Knope,It's certainly not here.,4,17
Leslie Knope,"And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, we were going to keep this a secret until we had everything in writing, but Bobby Newport is trying to convince a major European company to open up a factory in Pawnee.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,And that woman that he is with is an anti landmine advocate.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I didn't realize that you were pro landmine.,4,17
Perd Hapley,"I am not here to declare a winner, but Jennifer is the winner.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Thank you.,4,17
Perd Hapley,"Now it's time to move onto our next segment, which is a commercial.",4,17
Leslie Knope,"I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,She kicked our asses.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,4,17
Leslie Knope,How are we going to beat her?,4,17
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, she's like a hurricane.",4,17
Ben Wyatt,She's everywhere.,4,17
Leslie Knope,Literally.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, guys.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,You really stepped up your game.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,That was really fun.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,You almost got me.,4,17
Leslie Knope,I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"What are you talking about? Oh, that thing I said on the show? Oh, no.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,That was mostly made-up.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,Don't challenge me on that.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,That will backfire.,4,17
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, enjoy your dinner, guys.",4,17
Jennifer Barkley,I already took care of the bill.,4,17
Ben Wyatt,"Another round, please?",4,17
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.,4,17
Ron Swanson,Nice job on the water fountain.,4,17
April Ludgate,It wasn't me.,4,17
Ron Swanson,Don't deny it.,4,17
Ron Swanson,I know it wasn't the nurse.,4,17
Ron Swanson,I'm asking you to step up.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"Not replacing Leslie, just picking up some slack.",4,17
April Ludgate,I don't want to do things.,4,17
April Ludgate,"I want to not do things, just like you taught me.",4,17
Ron Swanson,"And I taught you well, but I don't like watching you wasting your brain.",4,17
Ron Swanson,And you're too smart to stay my assistant here forever.,4,17
Ron Swanson,"I'd rather you start a business or use your hands to farm, but right now, the department needs you.",4,17
Ron Swanson,Please.,4,17
April Ludgate,Okay But only because you begged.,4,17
Ron Swanson,Good girl.,4,17
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.,4,17
Ron Swanson,This is Ron Swanson.,4,17
Ron Swanson,April's going to take over some of Leslie's responsibilities.,4,17

Leslie Knope,I would rather talk about the ways to solve problems in this town.,4,18
Buddy Wood,Good luck with that.,4,18
Buddy Wood,"But getting back to your affair with Ben Wyatt, who's now your campaign manager",4,18
Leslie Knope,"Buddy, frankly, I don't want to discuss that.",4,18
Leslie Knope,"But if you'd like, we can talk about ways that I can improve the airport or our many wonderful parks.",4,18
Buddy Wood,I don't.,4,18
Buddy Wood,I'd like to talk about you and Ben Wyatt.,4,18
Ann Perkins,Uhoh.,4,18
Ann Perkins,I know that look.,4,18
Tom Haverford,She's got the crazy eyes.,4,18
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,4,18
Leslie Knope,"Well, like I said, I don't want to discuss it, Buddy, and, frankly, I don't appreciate your condescending tone.",4,18
Leslie Knope,But you know what?,4,18
Leslie Knope,"I've had a couple drinks, so what the hell?",4,18
Leslie Knope,Ben and I first,4,18
Buddy Wood,"I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, are you inebriated?",4,18
Leslie Knope,What?,4,18
Leslie Knope,No.,4,18
Leslie Knope,Preposterous.,4,18
Leslie Knope,Are you inebriated?,4,18
Leslie Knope,That was bad timing.,4,18
Buddy Wood,"This is a Buddy Wood first an exclusive interview with potential city councilwoman Leslie Knope, who appears to be drunk right now on camera.",4,18
Leslie Knope,I am not drunk.,4,18
Leslie Knope,"Yes, when you have a jumbo Margarita and some flaming Tequila shots, you can get drunk.",4,18
Buddy Wood,"Is it this sad, pathetic town that makes you drink this way?",4,18
Leslie Knope,This interview is over.,4,18
Buddy Wood,"Okay, Ms. Knope.",4,18
Leslie Knope,Oh This this is not because I'm drunk.,4,18
Leslie Knope,This is because of the wire.,4,18
Buddy Wood,"A fitting end to a bizarre interview and a sad moment in a depressing city with no hope, in the waning moments of the bitter saga that has been a contentious campaign.",4,18
Leslie Knope,"C'mon Buddy, you cannot air that tape.",4,18
Buddy Wood,Are you kidding?,4,18
Buddy Wood,This is as great for me as it is terrible for you.,4,18
Buddy Wood,The sheep that watch my show are gonna eat this up like tiramisu.,4,18
Buddy Wood,Tiramisu is an Italian dessert often,4,18
Leslie Knope,"I know what tiramisu is, okay?",4,18
Leslie Knope,And sheep don't eat it.,4,18
Buddy Wood,"Sorry, but Tomorrow morning this gets broadcast around the entire Indianasphere.",4,18
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for celebrating the most ultimate triumph of my life.,4,18
Andy Dwyer,"I'm very proud of me, and you are too.",4,18
Andy Dwyer,"And, Professor, I'm taking your class again next semester.",4,18
Andy Dwyer,And I'm gonna lock down that P plus.,4,18
Linda Lonegan,It's impossible.,4,18
Andy Dwyer,You and the women taught me that nothing is impossible.,4,18
Chris Traeger,"Alright, I better be going.",4,18
Chris Traeger,I have to get up early.,4,18
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.,4,18
Chris Traeger,I'm teaching a morning Zumba class for retirees.,4,18
Chris Traeger,"Before I do, Linda, do you enjoy land kayaking?",4,18
Chris Traeger,It's quite fun.,4,18
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's more grueling than fun.",4,18
Chris Traeger,But I would love to take you.,4,18
Linda Lonegan,"I'm really flattered, but I just got out of a relationship, and I think I need a little more time before I jump into anything.",4,18
Chris Traeger,Of course.,4,18
Chris Traeger,I understand.,4,18
Linda Lonegan,I'm sorry.,4,18
Chris Traeger,I appreciate your caution.,4,18
Linda Lonegan,Thank you.,4,18
Chris Traeger,I hope to see you again.,4,18
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, everyone.",4,18
Ron Swanson,Anybody want to go to JJ's for some after dinner omelets?,4,18
Linda Lonegan,Or how about you and I go back to my place?,4,18
Ron Swanson,Yes.,4,18
Andy Dwyer,Wow!,4,18
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I am so sorry.",4,18
Ben Wyatt,Let's just focus on the problem.,4,18
Ben Wyatt,"Now, if we don't stop that interview from airing in the morning, this campaign is dead.",4,18
Ben Wyatt,So We have to go to Indianapolis.,4,18
Tom Haverford,And do what?,4,18
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, Tom.",4,18
Ben Wyatt,I guess we'll just set fire to the studio or something.,4,18
Leslie Knope,"Ah, that's so sweet I've never had a boyfriend threaten to commit arson for me before.",4,18
Donna Meagle,"Ah, it gets old.",4,18
Tom Haverford,We still have six hours of rental time on the hot tub limo.,4,18
Tom Haverford,We could take that.,4,18
Tom Haverford,No one would have to drive all night.,4,18
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a good idea.,4,18
Tom Haverford,"Plus, it allows for the possibility of high speed skinny dipping.",4,18
Ann Perkins,Ugh.,4,18
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I was joking.",4,18
Tom Haverford,"Come on, it was a joke.",4,18
Ann Perkins,It was funny.,4,18
Extra,"Where we going, folks drive around, hit the strip clubs?",4,18
Tom Haverford,Yeah!,4,18
Ben Wyatt,No.,4,18
Ben Wyatt,We're going to this address in Indianapolis.,4,18
Extra,Really?,4,18
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,4,18
Extra,"You know, no one ever used this hottub limo for actual transportation.",4,18
Extra,"And I can't take this thing on the highway, so it'll take a few extra hours.",4,18
Extra,"Hey, is this a seven or a one?",4,18
Donna Meagle,Jerry.,4,18
Donna Meagle,Jerry!,4,18
Donna Meagle,Maybe you should wrap it up.,4,18
Donna Meagle,It's 4:00 in the morning.,4,18
Jerry Gergich,Is it really?,4,18
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh.",4,18
Jerry Gergich,Wow.,4,18
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that flew by, huh? I will just take these down to the post office and, uh, put the, uh Oh, jeez.",4,18
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, no.",4,18
Jerry Gergich,"I put the handout flyers in the mailing envelopes, and I was supposed to put these flyers in the envelopes.",4,18
Donna Meagle,Oh My God.,4,18
Jerry Gergich,"Well, you know, it's like I always say.",4,18
Jerry Gergich,It ain't government work if you don't have to do it twice.,4,18
Jerry Gergich,Here we go!,4,18
Donna Meagle,I'll make some coffee.,4,18
Buddy Wood,"Hey, you're blocking my driveway.",4,18
Buddy Wood,Leslie Knope? - What are you doing?,4,18
Leslie Knope,"Hi, um Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry.",4,18
Leslie Knope,"We, oh, my God, I can't see.",4,18
Leslie Knope,It's so bright out here.,4,18
Ben Wyatt,Ohh.,4,18
Leslie Knope,"We drove here to ask you, No, to beg you to please destroy that tape.",4,18
Buddy Wood,"Yeah, I got your 50 messages.",4,18
Ben Wyatt,Leslie was just out with her friends blowing off some steam.,4,18
Buddy Wood,What?,4,18
Leslie Knope,Please.,4,18
Leslie Knope,Please.,4,18
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please.",4,18
Leslie Knope,That's five pleases.,4,18
Buddy Wood,"As much as I enjoy the groveling, I can't destroy the tape because I don't have it, because your sad, tiny backwater airport lost my bags.",4,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?",4,18
Buddy Wood,"You'd think a commuter airport could handle the luggage of 11 people at once, but apparently not.",4,18
Buddy Wood,Completely ruined a great story.,4,18
Buddy Wood,Thank God for that mitten factory tragedy.,4,18
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,4,18
Leslie Knope,Mm.,4,18
Ben Wyatt,"God, that's",4,18
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,4,18

Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys, I just wanted to come by and thank you for a phenomenal evening.",4,18
April Ludgate,"Yeah, seems like we all had a phenomenal evening.",4,18
Chris Traeger,And I should probably thank you for introducing me to Linda.,4,18
Chris Traeger,I think we had a deep emotional connection that is very worth exploring.,4,18
Chris Traeger,So I'm gonna ask her out again When she's emotionally ready.,4,18
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.,4,18
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ron Great red shirt.",4,18
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, Ron you have to tell him what happened.",4,18
Ron Swanson,Why? It's none of his business.,4,18
April Ludgate,Because he's been super sad lately.,4,18
April Ludgate,It kind of seems like you should at least give him a heads-up so he doesn't get rejected again.,4,18
Ron Swanson,I like to not get involved in these matters or any matters of any nature.,4,18
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, you know, Ron, someone once told me that this is not how grown-ups deal with tough situations.",4,18
Andy Dwyer,We face them head-on.,4,18
Ron Swanson,Fine.,4,18
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Ron It was you who told me that.",4,18
Andy Dwyer,That's crazy.,4,18
Chris Traeger,There's that shirt.,4,18
Ron Swanson,"Look, Chris After the bar last night, I engaged in consensual activities with Linda.",4,18
Chris Traeger,I see.,4,18
Ron Swanson,I didn't plan it.,4,18
Ron Swanson,But it occurred.,4,18
Ron Swanson,Now you know.,4,18
Chris Traeger,"Well, thank you for being forthright and telling me.",4,18
Chris Traeger,"You're a good man, Ron.",4,18
Chris Traeger,I'm quite lonely.,4,18
Ron Swanson,"Ah, [Bleep].",4,18
Leslie Knope,"They say to win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky.",4,18
Leslie Knope,I got pretty damn lucky when I met Ben.,4,18
Leslie Knope,And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom and all my other friends volunteer to help me out.,4,18
Leslie Knope,And I'm super lucky that that tape disappeared.,4,18
Leslie Knope,I think we may have used up all our luck tonight.,4,18
Leslie Knope,"Actually, not all of it.",4,18
Leslie Knope,He's about to get lucky.,4,18
Leslie Knope,"It's, it's on.",4,18
Leslie Knope,He doesn't even know it yet.,4,18
Ann Perkins,Hey.,4,18
Tom Haverford,"Hey, sweetheart.",4,18
Tom Haverford,"I'm not sure you're even aware of this, but we have now gone 48 hours without breaking up, shattering our previous record.",4,18
Ann Perkins,That's not bad.,4,18
Tom Haverford,To celebrate,4,18

Extra,Way quicker.,4,19
Leslie Knope,Okay.,4,19
Leslie Knope,"Well, but you should watch that documentary.",4,19
Leslie Knope,"Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%.",4,19
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen.",4,19
Leslie Knope,I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.,4,19

Leslie Knope,She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.,4,19

Leslie Knope,Please.,4,19
Extra,"Okay, you got me.",4,19
Extra,I'll find the cuts somewhere else.,4,19
April Ludgate,"Good morning, everyone!",4,19
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate and I will be filling in for Leslie while she runs for office.,4,19
April Ludgate,So the new emergency protocol for the Parks department can be found in your binders.,4,19
Extra,What exactly is the chain of command visavis onsite response?,4,19
April Ludgate,"You know what, why don't we just say that whoever gets to the emergency first will be in charge?",4,19
Extra,"Okay, so if there's an explosion, say, in Ramset Park and someone from Sewage gets there first, they'd be in charge?",4,19
April Ludgate,I had no idea how terrible Leslie's job is.,4,19
April Ludgate,She referred to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride.,4,19
April Ludgate,"I'm not quite sure, but Tom can answer that if What are you doing?",4,19

Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure to inform you that you are a finalist for the job of Assistant City Manager.",4,19
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I feel I should remind you that I do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist.",4,19
Ron Swanson,"That said, you'd be a fool not to pick me.",4,19
Ron Swanson,I will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it means I'm able to further limit reckless government spending.,4,19
Ron Swanson,"I mean, I have so many ideas.",4,19
Ron Swanson,"Some are simple like ""take down traffic lights"" and ""eliminate the Post Office.""",4,19
Ron Swanson,"The bigger ones will be tougher, like ""bring all of this crumbling to the ground.""",4,19
Chris Traeger,There is one more step in the vetting process.,4,19
Chris Traeger,"You and I will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra.",4,19
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure I'm interested in that.,4,19
Ron Swanson,"No, I am sure.",4,19
Ron Swanson,I am not interested in that.,4,19

Chris Traeger,"Oh, wear your yoga pants.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I really wish we would've talked about this first.",4,19
Leslie Knope,What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget?,4,19
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,That's the point.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,"You're thinking like a Parks department employee, not a city council candidate.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,You're in a campaign literally.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,Everything you do right now is politics.,4,19
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?",4,19
Leslie Knope,Is this politics?,4,19
Ben Wyatt,Ow.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,What is what is that?,4,19
Ben Wyatt,What why did you do that?,4,19
Leslie Knope,I'm in a good mood.,4,19
Leslie Knope,Because the city councilor listened to me.,4,19
Leslie Knope,It means I have some juice.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this might be a good thing.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,But there's a reason we strategize before we make decisions.,4,19
Leslie Knope,Okay.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,"I'll make some calls, see where we are.",4,19
Leslie Knope,Enjoying the view.,4,19

April Ludgate,Please?,4,19
April Ludgate,Or just do it?,4,19
Tom Haverford,"Come on, lil sparkle.",4,19
Tom Haverford,Don't give up.,4,19
Tom Haverford,What does Leslie always say?,4,19
April Ludgate,"I don't know, weird stuff about waffles.",4,19
Tom Haverford,"She says, ""you get out of a job what you put into it.""",4,19
Tom Haverford,You just need to find a project you're passionate about.,4,19
Tom Haverford,"For instance, I was incredible at naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge because I care a great deal about signature beverages.",4,19
Tom Haverford,The Beeryonce Knowles.,4,19
Tom Haverford,"It's just a regular beer, but we put it in a sexyass mug.",4,19
Tom Haverford,Pairs nicely with the Jayzima.,4,19
Tom Haverford,We bought a bunch of zima when the factory shut down.,4,19
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.,4,19
April Ludgate,Maybe I should work at a bar.,4,19
Tom Haverford,"Come on, there must be some aspect of this job you care about.",4,19
Ron Swanson,Hello.,4,19
Ron Swanson,Here are some papers Leslie requested.,4,19
Ann Perkins,These are blank.,4,19
Ron Swanson,Weird.,4,19
Ron Swanson,"As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question?",4,19
Ron Swanson,Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris?,4,19
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah.",4,19
Ann Perkins,"When we dated, he made me do it every week.",4,19
Ron Swanson,What am I in for here?,4,19
Ann Perkins,"Okay, here's the deal.",4,19
Ann Perkins,"It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead.",4,19
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants?,4,19
Leslie Knope,Hey.,4,19
Leslie Knope,So did Pillner finalize the budget?,4,19
Leslie Knope,Are we okay?,4,19
Ben Wyatt,We are the opposite of okay.,4,19
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?,4,19
Ben Wyatt,"To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,"The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,So they're closing it at the end of the week.,4,19
April Ludgate,That's where Champion came from.,4,19
Andy Dwyer,What will happen to all the other animals?,4,19
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they'll be",4,19
Andy Dwyer,Fine.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,No.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,They'll be,4,19
Andy Dwyer,No!,4,19
Jerry Gergich,Guys.,4,19
Jennifer Barkley,"Apparently, Leslie Knope wielded her insider influence and got Councilman Pillner to save her precious department, even though it meant closing the shelter.",4,19
Jennifer Barkley,"Now I am not saying that Leslie Knope is a dog murderer, per se, I just think that her actions raise some questions.",4,19
Jennifer Barkley,"Like, for example, is she a dog murderer?",4,19
Ben Wyatt,God.,4,19
Perd Hapley,"Well, I don't know the answer to that, Jennifer, but your tone makes me think Yes.",4,19
Jennifer Barkley,"Say your goodbyes, Pebble 'Cause ""Weswie"" Knope gonna kill you.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,She got the perfect puppy for that shot.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,She is good.,4,19
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, there is a woman on the phone that says her daughter's scared to go to sleep because Leslie Knope's going to come murder her kitty.",4,19
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we can fix this.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we can.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, we are going back to Pillner and telling him to cut the Parks budget.",4,19
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no.",4,19
Leslie Knope,We can figure something else out.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,Leslie!,4,19
Leslie Knope,"Hey, honey, good morning.",4,19
Leslie Knope,How did you sleep?,4,19
Leslie Knope,I adopted 32 cats and dogs.,4,19
Leslie Knope,Do you want pancakes?,4,19
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make pancakes.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?,4,19
Leslie Knope,What?,4,19
Leslie Knope,Which one?,4,19
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?,4,19
Leslie Knope,You talking about this one?,4,19
Leslie Knope,This one right here?,4,19
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that is a pig.",4,19
Chris Traeger,This is the best meditation center in the area.,4,19
Ron Swanson,It doesn't look like much.,4,19
Chris Traeger,"Actually, this strip mall has surprisingly decent chi.",4,19
Chris Traeger,"Although, the smells from the Greek restaurant next door are not ideal.",4,19
Chris Traeger,"But through this door lies a deep, serene quietude.",4,19
Extra,"Excuse me, ladies.",4,19
Extra,On your right.,4,19
Chris Traeger,"After you, Ron.",4,19
Chris Traeger,Now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit.,4,19
Chris Traeger,Now quietly sit behind me and let's join breath.,4,19
Ron Swanson,I'll stand.,4,19
Chris Traeger,Interesting technique.,4,19
April Ludgate,"Andy, look at this little guy!",4,19
April Ludgate,He's such a little runt.,4,19
April Ludgate,"Hey, there.",4,19
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Tom, look.",4,19
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I just had five cats on me at once!",4,19
Andy Dwyer,You wanna come in here and try to break my record?,4,19
Tom Haverford,"That's okay, Andy, I think I'm gonna keep my distance.",4,19
Tom Haverford,Don't want none of that animal dander interacting with this cashmere.,4,19
Ben Wyatt,"What's your endgame here, my dear?",4,19
Leslie Knope,This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.,4,19
April Ludgate,"Hey, what if I threw together a pet adoption in one of our parks would that be cool?",4,19
Leslie Knope,"April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show.",4,19
April Ludgate,Ew.,4,19
April Ludgate,I think I may have found a project I'd actually enjoy doing helping these cats and dogs.,4,19
April Ludgate,They should be rewarded for not being people.,4,19
April Ludgate,I hate people.,4,19
Leslie Knope,"I'm very proud of you, April.",4,19
Leslie Knope,"Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable.",4,19
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben, the pig ate your noise canceling headphones.",4,19
Andy Dwyer,Pigs are awesome!,4,19
Ron Swanson,"All told, we were in there about six hours.",4,19
Ron Swanson,"And no, I was not meditating.",4,19
Ron Swanson,"I just stood there, quietly breathing.",4,19
Ron Swanson,There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.,4,19
Ron Swanson,My mind was blank.,4,19

Ben Wyatt,"There are three employees designated as D1, or on retainer.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,Public Works is still paying them even though they haven't worked in two years.,4,19
Leslie Knope,It's an oversight.,4,19
Leslie Knope,We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.,4,19

Ron Swanson,So if you're looking for someone who enjoys meditation,4,19
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I didn't expect you to enjoy it.",4,19
Chris Traeger,My one reservation about you as a coworker was that you seem inflexible.,4,19

Chris Traeger,I'm just so excited.,4,19
Councilman Houser,I'd put a pin in this for now.,4,19
Chris Traeger,Why?,4,19
Chris Traeger,Why pin it?,4,19
Councilman Houser,The council vote is three to two in favor of another term for you.,4,19
Councilman Houser,But one of the yes votes is retiring.,4,19
Councilman Houser,"If Bobby Newport wins, he's gonna try to bring in his own guy.",4,19

Extra,"Leslie, I am retiring at the end of this term, so I've been fine with you guys pushing me around on this budget thing.",4,19

Ron Swanson,I found a way to reduce government spending by 85%.,4,19
Ron Swanson,Here's a hint no more departments.,4,19
Chris Traeger,"Ha, that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait.",4,19
Chris Traeger,"Turns out that Bobby Newport, if he beats Leslie, is going to appoint his own city manager.",4,19
Chris Traeger,So I may have offered you a job that I have no authority to offer.,4,19
Chris Traeger,I'm so so sorry.,4,19

April Ludgate,Can you just leave me alone?,4,19
Tom Haverford,"Why so glum, sugar plum?",4,19
April Ludgate,"Um, I don't know.",4,19

April Ludgate,That's why it's stupid to work hard.,4,19
Tom Haverford,Let me show you something.,4,19
Tom Haverford,"Because you worked hard, this little terribly-dressed girl has a puppy.",4,19

Ben Wyatt,That's all we ask.,4,19
Jennifer Barkley,Okay.,4,19
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, what's to stop me from just paying for the shelter and still running the ads?",4,19
Leslie Knope,"Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget.",4,19
Ben Wyatt,"And we'll leak that it was Leslie's decision and yours seem tough and fair, what with sacrificing her old department",4,19

Leslie Knope,Yeah.,4,20

Leslie Knope,I'm very angry.,4,20
Leslie Knope,I'm angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don't give him what he wants.,4,20
Leslie Knope,It's despicable.,4,20
Leslie Knope,Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs.,4,20

Ron Swanson,You two have a good relationship.,4,22
Ron Swanson,"I don't personally know what that's like, but I'm given to understand that means you're going to land on your feet.",4,22

Jennifer Barkley,I really want to get out of here.,4,22
Jennifer Barkley,How about this why don't I make you guys a deal?,4,22

Ben Wyatt,Where is she?,4,22
Ann Perkins,I don't know.,4,22
Ann Perkins,She's not answering her phone.,4,22
Ben Wyatt,What?,4,22

Ron Swanson,"Corinthian leather, solid mahogany frame with what I believe are handcut mortise and tenon joints pinned with oak.",4,22
Leslie Knope,I was really looking forward to sitting in it.,4,22
Leslie Knope,Figured this might be my last chance.,4,22
Ron Swanson,You don't know that.,4,22
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for the last six months, my friends have worked so hard.",4,22

Chris Traeger,It was an employee appreciation barbecue.,5,1
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I gave you the chance to become assistant city manager.",5,1
Chris Traeger,"And you chose to stay here, which is fine.",5,1
Chris Traeger,"But if you're going to lead the department, you occasionally have to lead the department.",5,1
Chris Traeger,And I say that as one of your closest colleagues and dearest friends But also as your boss.,5,1
Leslie Knope,I went to our nation's capital this weekend in order to apply for a federal grant to clean up our city's river.,5,1

Leslie Knope,What a powerful image.,5,2
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?,5,2
Leslie Knope,What did you put in the sugar?,5,2

Andy Dwyer,"So, I've got a list of everything that I'm supposed to be able to do to get into the police academy, and number one is, ""be able to run 2 miles in under 25 minutes.""",5,2
Andy Dwyer,"That's a typo, right?",5,2
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, that's humanly impossible.",5,2
Chris Traeger,"When you are able to focus your mind and your body, anything is possible.",5,2
Tom Haverford,Anything is possible!,5,2
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, recently, many of the local restaurants have changed their ""small size"" option to a whopping 64ounces.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"That's correct, and it's great for the consumer.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,More bang for the buck.,5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,Are we putting bargains on trial here?,5,2
Ann Perkins,"How could any sane person call that ""small""?",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, if the customer truly wants a smaller size, there is an option.",5,2
Ann Perkins,"Oh, do you mean the ""li'I swallow""?",5,2
Ann Perkins,Does anybody buy that?,5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"Some girls buy them for their dollhouses, but they're not very popular.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"I mean, for only a nickel more, you get 64 ounces.",5,2
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, Paunch Burger just recently came out with a new 128ounce option.",5,2
Leslie Knope,"Most people call it a gallon, but they call it the ""regular.""",5,2
Leslie Knope,"Then, there is a horrifying 512 ounce version that they call ""child size.""",5,2
Leslie Knope,"""How is this a ""childsize soda""?",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, it's roughly the size of a two year old child, if the child were liquefied.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,It's a real bargain at $1.59.,5,2
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ms. Pinewood, but why would anybody need this much soda?",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"It's not my place to speak for the consumer, but everyone should buy it.",5,2
Chris Traeger,"Come on, Andy, come on.",5,2
Chris Traeger,You can do it.,5,2
Chris Traeger,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.",5,2

Chris Traeger,I guess I'm proud of me.,5,2
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, man.",5,2
Andy Dwyer,Me too.,5,2
Chris Traeger,We have so much work to do.,5,2

April Ludgate,"I actually think you look really good, except for the stick up your butt.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,Who do you think drew it?,5,2
Ben Wyatt,Was it Nathaniel?,5,2
Ben Wyatt,Ellis?,5,2
Ben Wyatt,"Man, I feel like these interns do not respect or like me at all.",5,2
April Ludgate,"Honestly, you could loosen up a bit on the font stuff. And everything in general.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,"God, this is insane.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,They're interns.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,"They're totally replaceable, and I'm their boss.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,Just fire them.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, hey, Jen.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, I'm having a problem with some of the interns.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking of making some changes.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,Turns out Ellis is Congressman Murray's nephew.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,Nathaniel is related to Donald Rumsfeld.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,Brittany's dad is Ben Bernanke's dentist.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,Every single one of these little twerps is seriously connected.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,"So, new plan.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,"Instead of firing them, I am going to kiss their asses like crazy.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"Ms. Knope, this is about consumer rights, and if they don't want to drink our delicious sodas, we do provide healthier options, like water zero.",5,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes.",5,2
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about water zero.,5,2
Leslie Knope,"The name implies that there are zero calories, like most water, but in fact, it has 300 calories per serving.",5,2
Leslie Knope,Isn't that misleading?,5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"The zero on the label refers to the amount of water in it, which is zero.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"If you want zero calorie water, try diet water zero lite.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,It has only 60 calories.,5,2
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think we're done here.",5,2
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.,5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, councilwoman, one more thing.",5,2
Kathryn Pinewood,"If your tax bill passes, local restaurants will hurt badly.",5,2

Leslie Knope,You're bluffing.,5,2
Leslie Knope,She's bluffing.,5,2

Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?,5,2
Leslie Knope,Yes.,5,2
Extra,"Yeah, I work at Colonel Plump's, and word around the Slop Trough is, they're talking about laying people off.",5,2
Extra,"So, maybe you could get off your high horse and help me keep my job.",5,2

Ron Swanson,Right.,5,2
Ron Swanson,That was the worst thing you were.,5,2

April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm sorry I drew those pictures of you.",5,2
April Ludgate,I was just messing around.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you may not take this seriously, but this job is important to me.",5,2
Ben Wyatt,"And by the way, you should take it seriously, because I asked you to come work here because I thought you'd enjoy it and I think you're smart, but you have to have some semblance of professionalism, and I need you to give, like, even a 15% effort.",5,2
April Ludgate,12%.,5,2
Ben Wyatt,15,5,2
Ben Wyatt,"For God's sake, I'm asking for 15% effort.",5,2

Leslie Knope,"Recently, the Captain of the Pawnee Porpoises swim team asked me if we could keep the public pools open longer so they could log more practice time, and I said, ""Absolutely.""",5,3
Leslie Knope,Because not only am I a city councilor.,5,3

Leslie Knope,Porpoise call!,5,3
Extra,What are you doing?,5,3

Andy Dwyer,311,5,3
Ron Swanson,"Well, Diane, for potholes, you want to speak with Public Works.",5,3

Tom Haverford,He knows how much you want this.,5,3
Tom Haverford,He's just trying to get something in return.,5,3
Tom Haverford,This is a bargaining tool.,5,3

Leslie Knope,Let's go over the plan.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you and I go stargazing in Harvey James park, while my parents slowly strangle each other in the living room.",5,6
Leslie Knope,No.,5,6
Leslie Knope,Your mom arrives at 7:00.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"We hand her a glass of chilled white wine, and, oh, look, my mom is walking over, and they're both educators and mothers.",5,6
Leslie Knope,What a fabulous coincidence.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Then later, Stephen Wyatt shows up that's your dad.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Yes.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,He's terrifying.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"We make some small talk, and 30 minutes later, I show everybody the big surprise.",5,6

Ben Wyatt,This is amazing.,5,6
Leslie Knope,I know.,5,6
Leslie Knope,I worked really hard on it.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"And, out of respect, I did not include any images of the only other man in the world who's as sexy as you, Joe Biden.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, you did, right there.",5,6
Leslie Knope,Hmm?,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, that's just a little one.",5,6

Ann Perkins,"Everyone, before everyone else gets here, I'd like to make a little toast.",5,6
Ann Perkins,My romantic life has been a bit of a mixed bag lately.,5,6
Ann Perkins,"And when that's the case, it's hard not to be cynical about love and relationships, but it's couples like you that give hope to the rest of us.",5,6
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you deserve the best, and you found it.",5,6
Ann Perkins,"Ben, don't you dare hurt her.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,I won't.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,Don't laugh.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,She means it.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I won't.",5,6
Ron Swanson,"Seriously, son, don't hurt her.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm not planning on hurting her.",5,6
Jerry Gergich,You better not be.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,I'm not!,5,6
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Ben, you best watch yourself.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Why would any of you think I would hurt Leslie?,5,6
Ben Wyatt,You're all my friends too.,5,6
April Ludgate,Nah.,5,6
Chris Traeger,This was literally the most beautiful and moving thing that I have ever heard.,5,6

Chris Traeger,Ann.,5,6
Ann Perkins,Hey.,5,6
Ann Perkins,"You all right, man?",5,6
Chris Traeger,"The toast that you gave to Ben and Leslie was so beautiful, and I'm feeling very raw from my therapy.",5,6
Chris Traeger,I am so happy And so sad.,5,6
Chris Traeger,It's like a perfect storm of emotions.,5,6
Chris Traeger,"And so I'm hiding out here, so I don't ruin this party for my two amazing best friends who I love so much.",5,6
Chris Traeger,Oh!,5,6
Chris Traeger,There's no more tissue.,5,6
Chris Traeger,Everything ends!,5,6
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no.",5,6
Ann Perkins,"No, there's more tissue.",5,6
Ann Perkins,There's,5,6
Chris Traeger,Everything goes away.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"And I said, rules or no rules, I just have to kiss that beautiful face.",5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, that's a Knope woman for you.",5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"When we see something adorable, we attack it.",5,6

Ben Wyatt,And pack it up.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"It's over, we're screwed.",5,6
Leslie Knope,He brought his girlfriend?,5,6
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't supposed to bring his girlfriend, Ben.",5,6
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, Ben!",5,6
Julia Wyatt,Your father brought his little plaything.,5,6
Steve Wyatt,"Hiya, Benny.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Dad, hi.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Hi.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,Unh.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ulani.",5,6

Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we will.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,I called a cab.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,It's outside.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"I gave the driver 100 bucks to sit and wait, so whenever we're ready to go like, maybe right now all we have to do is walk outside.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to be here now, with you and your parents.",5,6
Leslie Knope,Help me make this work.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Best thing to do is distract them with innocuous talk about the stuff they care about.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Great, like what?",5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they're white people from Minnesota, so hockey, fishing, skiing, sailing, and after a few drinks, put on a Prince album.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Don't mention the Green Bay Packers or the state of Iowa.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"And also, I have enough frequent flyer miles to get us to Australia tonight.",5,6
Ann Perkins,Everything okay?,5,6

Ann Perkins,"Go in there, calm him down, make him feel better.",5,6
Ann Perkins,"Leslie and Ben have enough to deal with, okay?",5,6
Ann Perkins,Thank you.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why is Chris crying?",5,6
Ann Perkins,"Uh, he's emotional.",5,6
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why is Chris emotional?",5,6
Ann Perkins,"Because he's in therapy right now, and it's dredging up a lot of stuff for him.",5,6
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, wait, like what kind of stuff?",5,6
Ann Perkins,"Like, I don't know, his friends are getting married, and he's not dating anyone.",5,6
Andy Dwyer,Why isn't he dating anyone?,5,6
April Ludgate,"Yeah, why don't you date him?",5,6
Ann Perkins,"Because I'm dating myself right now, okay?",5,6
Ann Perkins,I'mI'm trying to figure out how to make me happy.,5,6
April Ludgate,"Ugh, why is it always about you, Ann?",5,6

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What are those, shrimp?",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ah!,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Okay.,5,6
Ron Swanson,"Rethink that move, son.",5,6
Ulani,Let's just drive back.,5,6
Ulani,I feel weird.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Steve, you like sailing, right?",5,6
Steve Wyatt,"Not any more, since Julia got the boat in the divorce and then sold it to a scrapyard because she's terrible.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least you don't have to deal with all that boat upkeep now, right, huh?",5,6
Leslie Knope,"Yech, no thankee.",5,6
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about something other than sailing.,5,6
Leslie Knope,Why don't you head in the other room?,5,6
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise that there she goes.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"There's a surprise for you, so, um, head on in.",5,6
Steve Wyatt,I don't like surprises.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, you gave it a try, but this quilt thing is not going to work.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"Ben, on three separate occasions, I have used a quilt to mend fences.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"In ninth grade, a quilt ended an argument between my two best friends, and a quilt settled the Donna Jerry parking lot feud of 2006.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,What was the third time?,5,6
Leslie Knope,Right [Bleep] now.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I still don't think it's gonna work, but I am really attracted to you right now.",5,6
Leslie Knope,I know.,5,6
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,"Police, open up!",5,6
Andy Dwyer,We have a warrant!,5,6
Andy Dwyer,"Just kidding, it's us.",5,6
Andy Dwyer,"Ha, we got you!",5,6
Chris Traeger,Andy and April.,5,6
April Ludgate,We have someone who wants to see you!,5,6
Chris Traeger,Champion!,5,6
Chris Traeger,Come here.,5,6
Chris Traeger,"Hey, big boy.",5,6
Chris Traeger,"You are such a brave, good dog, with so much spirit.",5,6
Chris Traeger,You've overcome so much.,5,6
Chris Traeger,You are the most wonderful dog in the whole world.,5,6
Chris Traeger,And I am so happy for you.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, I have a surprise for all of you.",5,6
Leslie Knope,Voila!,5,6
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt!,5,6
Leslie Knope,"It represents our two families coming together, and there is a personalized square for each member of our joint family, see?",5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, this is lovely.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom.",5,6
Ulani,Where's my square?,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're not technically",5,6
Steve Wyatt,Not technically what?,5,6
Julia Wyatt,Not technically an adult.,5,6
Steve Wyatt,"This is a very thoughtless omission, Leslie, and as far as I'm concerned, if there's no Ulani square, this is not a legitimate unity quilt.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that old Chestnut.",5,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,5,6
Leslie Knope,I will make an Ulani square.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Very, very easy.",5,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is your square now.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"What does ""Ulani"" mean?",5,6
Ulani,"""Cheerful.""",5,6
Leslie Knope,Sure.,5,6
Leslie Knope,All right.,5,6
Leslie Knope,Look at that.,5,6
Leslie Knope,Unity!,5,6
Leslie Knope,It's that simple.,5,6
Leslie Knope,All we had to do was,5,6
Julia Wyatt,I don't want her name on my quilt.,5,6
Leslie Knope,It's not your it's everyone's quilt.,5,6
Leslie Knope,It's a unity quilt.,5,6
Ulani,I think it's mean that you didn't do a square for me.,5,6
Steve Wyatt,It's a disaster is what it is.,5,6
Julia Wyatt,"You can say that again, Steve.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben, they're agreeing.",5,6
Leslie Knope,It's working.,5,6
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm thinking we junk everything except the mannequins.",5,6
Tom Haverford,Ron's gotta see how dope the outfits are.,5,6
Tom Haverford,That's the business.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why are we going to Ron?,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ron should be coming to us!,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We created Entertainment 720.,5,6
Tom Haverford,Which was a huge failure.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I don't know,5,6
Tom Haverford,"Look, a bank's not gonna give us a loan, and Ron loves my entrepreneurial spirit.",5,6
Tom Haverford,"Trust me, he's our best chance at getting startup money.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I hear that.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let's go clubbing.,5,6
Tom Haverford,"No, we gotta work.",5,6
Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear me say we gotta junk most of the presentation?,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tommy, I will always be there for you, no matter what, but right now, I cannot be there for you because I have to go.",5,6
Tom Haverford,"I hate to say this, but Sometimes you've gotta work a little, so you can ball a lot.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That was beautiful.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That changed me.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll give you ten minutes.,5,6
Ann Perkins,"You have to try to eat something, okay?",5,6
Chris Traeger,Mmm!,5,6
Chris Traeger,"Wow, that's amazing.",5,6
Ann Perkins,See?,5,6
Ann Perkins,There you go.,5,6
Chris Traeger,This one's not as good.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Chris, here's the plan.",5,6
Andy Dwyer,I'm just gonna list off happy things until you're cheered up.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,"Pizza, the beach, rock and roll music",5,6
April Ludgate,and I'll list terrible things to bring you back down.,5,6
April Ludgate,"Smallpox, botched surgery, snails crawling out of your mouth.",5,6
Chris Traeger,This is weirdly working.,5,6
Chris Traeger,It's evening me out.,5,6
Ann Perkins,"Okay, keep going, keep going.",5,6
Andy Dwyer,Laughter.,5,6
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your mouth.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,The beach.,5,6
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out out of your mouth.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,Cute cats.,5,6
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your butt.,5,6
Andy Dwyer,Dave Matthews Band.,5,6
April Ludgate,Dave Matthews Band.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Look, Dad, Leslie worked really hard on this, so can you just cool it for, like, 30 seconds?",5,6
Steve Wyatt,"Sure, I can.",5,6
Steve Wyatt,But your mother can't.,5,6
Steve Wyatt,See?,5,6
Steve Wyatt,"She's ruining your quilt, just like she ruined our marriage!",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Mom!,5,6
Ulani,"Oh, I didn't know we could cut that.",5,6
Julia Wyatt,"It had to be done, Ben.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,It absolutely did not have to be done.,5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Look, champagne!",5,6
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, why don't we just forget about the quilt and just raise a glass?",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Yes!,5,6
Ben Wyatt,Toasts are fun.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,They usually signify the end of a party.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Here you are, Ulani.",5,6
Ulani,"I'm good, thanks.",5,6
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, by all means, go ahead and take it, Ulani.",5,6
Julia Wyatt,"Or, wait, are you even old enough to drink?",5,6
Ulani,"Yes, Julia, I am, but I can't because I'm pregnant.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,You're what?,5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, boy.",5,6
Steve Wyatt,"I didn't mean to steal your spotlight, but the cat's out of the bag.",5,6
Steve Wyatt,"Young Ben is going to have a new baby sister, huh?",5,6
Steve Wyatt,"Still firing bullets, son.",5,6
Julia Wyatt,I cannot be in the same room as him.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,What about the wedding?,5,6
Julia Wyatt,I'm talking about the wedding.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Wyatt family.",5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It's like the war of the Wyatts out there!,5,6
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's so brutal!",5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, my God.",5,6
Leslie Knope,Were you and Dad ever like that?,5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, like any married couple, honey, your father and I fought occasionally, and sometimes he won the argument, and sometimes I won.",5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"But usually, we forgot what we were arguing about and just had sex.",5,6
Leslie Knope,La la la la la.,5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Anyway, the important thing is that we always ended up on the same team.",5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And in the same bed.,5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"God, I miss that man.",5,6
Leslie Knope,How can you be so wise and so inappropriate at the same time?,5,6
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'm a parent.,5,6
Tom Haverford,I can't figure out how to phrase this mission statement.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let me get a shot at it.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.,5,6
Tom Haverford,"See? You just googled, ""Amanda Bynes side boob.""",5,6
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What's wrong with you? Why is your safesearch on? That is amateur hour, Tom.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Listen, we've been at this for an entire evening.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I say, why don't we cut our losses? If it was such a good idea, we would be millionaires by now.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hello.,5,6
Tom Haverford,"Look, man, I believe in this idea.",5,6
Tom Haverford,"Do you? You know I love you, but I don't think you're as serious about this business as I am.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, yeah, no, I'm definitely not.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I got your text.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?,5,6
Leslie Knope,I grabbed all of the brownies from the dessert table and four bottles of wine.,5,6
Leslie Knope,Get in the car.,5,6
Leslie Knope,We're going to Australia.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,Leslie,5,6
Leslie Knope,I am so sorry for everything.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I want to be on your team.",5,6
Leslie Knope,"I am on your team, but I think that our team should be far away from here.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Normally, I would get in the cab with you, but I am so sick of them ruining everything, and I really liked that unity quilt.",5,6
Leslie Knope,It was a good quilt.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,It was an awesome quilt.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Look, my parents are insane, but they need to be at our wedding.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,You know what?,5,6
Ben Wyatt,It's time for this team to come up with a new plan.,5,6
Leslie Knope,I agree.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"Phase one of our new plan, you get in the backseat of this cab, and we hardcore make out for 15 minutes.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,I would love to do that.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,I'm just not sure if the driver would be okay with it.,5,6
Extra,"For another 100 bucks, you can do whatever you want.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,Let's do this.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Swan song!,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What up, my man? Ow, are you kidding me?",5,6
Ron Swanson,JeanRalphio.,5,6
Ron Swanson,I thought you and Tom were working on your presentation.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, I decided it was best if I took my talents elsewhere.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you know what I mean?,5,6
Ron Swanson,You abandoned your friend?,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"God, no.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He fired me, straight up.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Talked about how I wasn't serious enough about the project, how he needed to grow up.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Anyway, I have an amazing investment idea for you.",5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Condoms with pictures on them.,5,6
Ron Swanson,Pass.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Good.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Smart.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I think you made the right decision.,5,6
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Take care.,5,6
Ann Perkins,Oh.,5,6
Ann Perkins,Chris?,5,6
Ann Perkins,Seems like the storm has passed.,5,6
Chris Traeger,Indeed it has.,5,6
Chris Traeger,I can't believe that I spent the entire party in a room being happy sad on a night that means so much to my two best friends.,5,6
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're going through a lot.",5,6
Ann Perkins,You need to purge all this stuff that's been building up.,5,6
April Ludgate,"This lesbian nurse is right, Chris.",5,6
April Ludgate,You can't keep it all bottled up.,5,6
Chris Traeger,Maybe you're right.,5,6
Chris Traeger,Maybe all of my emotions tumbling out like this means that I can get a clean start.,5,6
Ann Perkins,"Well, for that, you're gonna have to visit the bathroom first.",5,6
Ann Perkins,Right?,5,6
April Ludgate,No.,5,6
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!,5,6
Andy Dwyer,Nope.,5,6
Chris Traeger,"You are, without a doubt, the queen of toilet humor.",5,6
Ann Perkins,That's all I ever wanted to be.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,This was supposed to be a happy occasion.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"You were supposed to come here, celebrate your son's engagement, maybe bury the ax? And not in each other's back.",5,6
Leslie Knope,But it did not work out that way.,5,6
Leslie Knope,So here is the new plan.,5,6
Leslie Knope,"I don't expect you to like each other, but you have to come to the wedding, okay? We'll seat you far away from each other.",5,6
Leslie Knope,You don't even have to socialize.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, in fact, we insist that you don't.",5,6
Ben Wyatt,But you do have to show up and tell us that you had a great time.,5,6
Ben Wyatt,That's the deal.,5,6

April Ludgate,"And it's zone 14B, industrial waste cleanup site.",5,7

Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, this is a great place for a dog park.",5,7
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, there's already a dog here.",5,7
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",5,7

Ron Swanson,What's his deal?,5,7
Leslie Knope,He's new.,5,7
Leslie Knope,"He used to be a slacker, but now he's realizing his full potential, but at what cost?",5,7
Leslie Knope,"He's smart, and he's beautiful, and I think of him in many ways as a daughter, but that would be crazy 'cause he's a man and his name's Ricky.",5,7
Leslie Knope,Here's my question.,5,7
Leslie Knope,How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too meish?,5,7
Ron Swanson,Sometimes I'd just give you busy work.,5,7
Ron Swanson,I once had you put together a brochure about different kinds of Indiana topsoil.,5,7
Leslie Knope,That soil brochure was not busy work.,5,7
Leslie Knope,"I mean, people still refer to Mulch Ado About Nothing.",5,7
Ron Swanson,"And if you were particularly amped up about a project, I'd take you to JJ's and distract you with waffles.",5,7
Leslie Knope,Those were distraction waffles?,5,7
Leslie Knope,I thought they were friendship waffles.,5,7
Ron Swanson,Breakfast food can serve many purposes.,5,7
Leslie Knope,"But what if this person, this Ricky, who is real, doesn't like waffles or anything.",5,7
Ron Swanson,Everybody has something they're passionate about.,5,7
Ron Swanson,"Just figure out what it is, express an interest in it, and divert his attention.",5,7

Leslie Knope,Yeah.,5,7
Leslie Knope,I see that now.,5,7
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Orin.",5,7
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Wicks, if you've read our proposal, you'll see that an alliance between RentASwag and Sweetums could be mutually beneficial.",5,7

Tom Haverford,"Oh, my escargot delivery service, Snail Mail.",5,7

Andy Dwyer,"Well, Gary if that even is your real name Somebody stole my computer.",5,7
Andy Dwyer,"Now, if you're a criminal, look at me, you have to tell me legally, or else it's considered entrapment.",5,7
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Andy.",5,7
Jerry Gergich,It wasn't me.,5,7
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, really?",5,7
Andy Dwyer,No.,5,7
Andy Dwyer,Okay.,5,7
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, so we know it's not Jerry, unless he was lying to me.",5,7
Andy Dwyer,I can never tell when people are lying to me.,5,7
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully that doesn't come up in my police work.,5,7
Leslie Knope,I think we should do more stuff like this.,5,7
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think Pawnee needs an amazing arts program.",5,7
Leslie Knope,Maybe you should just drop everything and coordinate it.,5,7
April Ludgate,I'm not stupid.,5,7
Leslie Knope,What is that supposed to mean?,5,7
April Ludgate,It means that the only reason you brought me here is to distract me from the dog park.,5,7
April Ludgate,You hate this show.,5,7
Leslie Knope,I love this show.,5,7
April Ludgate,What's your favorite part?,5,7
Leslie Knope,The heavy handedness.,5,7
April Ludgate,"You know what, I have to go talk to Councilman Jamm right now.",5,7
Leslie Knope,Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm?,5,7
April Ludgate,"Because I told him about the dog park idea, and he loves it.",5,7
April Ludgate,He thinks it's a great idea.,5,7
April Ludgate,"He's gonna support my motion at the city council meeting tomorrow, and he gave me a really cool dental mirror to check out my molars.",5,7
Leslie Knope,"Our dispute aside, you should be careful with Jamm.",5,7
Leslie Knope,"He's a snake, I'm telling you.",5,7
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like I should trust you out of all people right now.",5,7
Orin,Moo.,5,7

Tom Haverford,"Not to mention in the last month alone three people have confused me for a shorter, Indian Ryan Gosling.",5,7

Jeremy Jamm,Who here thinks parks are stupid?,5,7
Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show that everyone is raising their hands.,5,7
Jeremy Jamm,"I happen to know for a fact that Pawnee's favorite fast food restaurant, Paunch Burger, needs a new location.",5,7
Jeremy Jamm,"Now, seeing as how the future of lot 48 is open for debate, I move we sell it to Paunch Burger for a nice profit.",5,7
Jeremy Jamm,You don't even have to be Asian to do math that simple.,5,7
April Ludgate,You told me you wanted a dog park.,5,7

Chris Traeger,"Andy, I love your enthusiasm, but we don't really have the kind of money to launch a massive investigation.",5,7

Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man.",5,7
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man.",5,7
Tom Haverford,Get any more job offers since I last saw you?,5,7
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but it was just a management position at Urban Outfitters.",5,7
Ben Wyatt,I turned it down.,5,7
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, man.",5,7
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can't hack this.,5,7
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job.,5,7
Ben Wyatt,"Well, my accounting job isn't boring.",5,7
Tom Haverford,"If it was remotely interesting, there would be a show on A&E about it.",5,7

April Ludgate,I don't care.,5,7
April Ludgate,Orin's my role model.,5,7
Ann Perkins,"April, maybe you want to admit that you've been a little selfish and inconsiderate.",5,7
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I ever wanted was for you to show the enthusiasm you showed for your dog park, and, when you did, I blew it.",5,7
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.,5,7

April Ludgate,"Okay, Ann, since you're such a genius, what do we do now?",5,7
Ann Perkins,"Neither of you want Jamm to win, nor do I, because I hate Paunch Burger, but, if there is one in my backyard, I will eat there, like, every night, and that is no good.",5,7
Ann Perkins,"So I say we stop playing dirty with each other, and we start playing dirty with Jamm.",5,7

Chris Traeger,"Andy, while I appreciate your dedication to finding this criminal, I think you might want to take into account what the policeman said.",5,7
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, gosh, if I can't even investigate bad guys, why become a cop at all?",5,7
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?,5,7
Andy Dwyer,"When I get bummed out, I take my shirt off because the bad feelings make me feel sweaty.",5,7

Andy Dwyer,No deal.,5,7

Jeremy Jamm,What the hell is going on?,5,7
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Councilman.",5,7
Leslie Knope,"The dogs are here because there's no dog park in your neighborhood, and the kids are here because there's no human park in your area.",5,7
Leslie Knope,They all needed a place to play.,5,7
Jeremy Jamm,My front lawn?,5,7
April Ludgate,"That's right, and they're gonna keep using it until there's an actual park nearby.",5,7

Derry Murbles,"A Bat Signal, for listeners who might not know, refers to the children's character ""the Bat Man"" a strong gentleman who fights crime nocturnally.",5,8
Leslie Knope,That's correct.,5,8

Ben Wyatt,His name's Wreston St. James.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,He's from Eagleton.,5,8
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I've changed my mind.",5,8
Leslie Knope,"I'm not being melodramatic when I say that people from Eagleton are snobby and evil, and they look down on Pawnee, and they would most likely exterminate everyone who isn't from Eagleton if they weren't so busy being obsessed with themselves.",5,8
Leslie Knope,"God, that was close.",5,8
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes when I rant about Eagleton, I forget to breathe, and I pass out.",5,8
Leslie Knope,No.,5,8
Leslie Knope,We cannot have someone from Eagleton design a park for Pawnee.,5,8
Leslie Knope,We have had a blood feud that has lasted for 200 years.,5,8

Ben Wyatt,So let's at least go meet the guy.,5,8

Wreston St. James,Wreston St. James.,5,8
Wreston St. James,Thank you so much for coming.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,"No, thank you.",5,8
Wreston St. James,"Well, what do you think of our newest park?",5,8
Leslie Knope,Eh.,5,8

Leslie Knope,"Well, they always wine and dine you first, but the fact of the matter is Eagletonians are, without exception, snobby, condescending jerks.",5,8
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee side of our border with Eagleton And this is the Eagleton side.,5,8

Andy Dwyer,"I got so bored, I started thinking about existence ""Do I matter?""",5,8
Andy Dwyer,Do any of us?,5,8
Andy Dwyer,"Is there a master plan in the works, a grand design?",5,8
Andy Dwyer,Just dumb stuff like that.,5,8
April Ludgate,Ugh!,5,8

Wreston St. James,I remember when Pawnee had that massive sewage overflow in Circle Park whatever happened with that?,5,8
Leslie Knope,We totally fixed it.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,"Well, except for the smell.",5,8
Ben Wyatt,The scientists think it's going to linger for another 40 years.,5,8
Leslie Knope,Can we just cut to the chase here?,5,8
Leslie Knope,Why would a fancy Eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny Pawnee park?,5,8
Wreston St. James,"Well, I heard your plea on the radio, and you were so passionate about the project.",5,8
Wreston St. James,It doesn't matter if it's a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park.,5,8
Wreston St. James,It's about the people.,5,8
Wreston St. James,We're here to serve them.,5,8

Leslie Knope,You're like a Southern belle when Rhett Butler comes around.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,Yes.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,Rhett Butler.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,That's who he reminds me of.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,Or Bono!,5,8
Leslie Knope,What?,5,8
Leslie Knope,No one from Eagleton has ever wanted to help anyone from Pawnee for any reason.,5,8
Leslie Knope,"In 1988, we were hit by a tornado.",5,8
Leslie Knope,"We asked Eagleton for help, and they claimed they weren't home.",5,8
Leslie Knope,An entire town claimed they weren't home.,5,8
Leslie Knope,I don't trust that guy for a second.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, look what Wreston commissioned from the balloon artisan.",5,8
Ben Wyatt,It's us.,5,8

Wreston St. James,We owe them a debt of gratitude.,5,8
Leslie Knope,Mm.,5,8
Leslie Knope,"June, 1817, the richest among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like cowards to form Eagleton.",5,8
Leslie Knope,Recognize any of your ancestors among the meanies?,5,8
Wreston St. James,"Actually, like most people from the area, I have ancestors on both sides.",5,8
Wreston St. James,That's why I think this rivalry is just a little silly and selfdefeating.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you may not know this, but Leslie was actually born in Eagleton.",5,8
Leslie Knope,Do not blame me for the sins of my mother.,5,8
Wreston St. James,"Look Ms. Knope, I'm really trying here, but I just don't know if our working together is such a great idea.",5,8
Leslie Knope,Oh running away so soon.,5,8
Leslie Knope,Typical.,5,8
Leslie Knope,"You know, say what you want about Pawneeans, but we never give up.",5,8

Leslie Knope,"Oh, look who's paying attention to me now!",5,8
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,Can I speak to you privately for a minute?,5,8
Andy Dwyer,The name is special agent Bert Macklin.,5,8
Andy Dwyer,"Tell me who you are, who you work for, and don't bother trying to lie to me, because I'm amazing.",5,8
April Ludgate,"My name is Judy Hitler, and I am the spoiled only daughter of Adolf.",5,8
April Ludgate,"And I'm going to tell my Daddy you were mean to me, Bert Macklin.",5,8
April Ludgate,He's not going to like it very much.,5,8
April Ludgate,So untie me!,5,8
Andy Dwyer,"Nice try, Miss Hitler, but you have something that I want.",5,8
Andy Dwyer,Where's the necklace with all of Germany's war secrets?,5,8
April Ludgate,I don't know what you are talking about.,5,8
Andy Dwyer,I think you do!,5,8
April Ludgate,I don't!,5,8
Andy Dwyer,"Now, you give me that war ending necklace, or I will resort to torture.",5,8
April Ludgate,Fine.,5,8
April Ludgate,"I will show you where it is, damn it.",5,8

Chris Traeger,Are they copper or brass?,5,8
Chris Traeger,Is one better?,5,8
Chris Traeger,"And if so, why?",5,8

Chris Traeger,Another in a long line of lessons from the great Ron Swanson.,5,8
Chris Traeger,"My therapist, Dr.",5,8
Chris Traeger,"Richard Nygard, suggested that I try some non exercise based hobbies.",5,8
Chris Traeger,So I've been studying woodworking with Ron.,5,8
Chris Traeger,I made this.,5,8
Chris Traeger,"Before I started, it was bigger.",5,8
Ron Swanson,Here.,5,8
Ron Swanson,I have designed something very important.,5,8
Ron Swanson,Why don't you start work on that right away?,5,8
Chris Traeger,"Yes, sir!",5,8
Ron Swanson,It's a flight of stairs that leads to nowhere.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,Were you listening to him when he was talking about serving the public and making our communities better?,5,8
Ben Wyatt,"You know who he sounds like, right?",5,8
Leslie Knope,Yes.,5,8
Leslie Knope,Idi Amin.,5,8
Leslie Knope,Or Lord Voldemort.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,No.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,You.,5,8

Leslie Knope,"You are a laugh riot, Ben.",5,8
Leslie Knope,I am never going to apologize to someone from Eagleton.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,All right.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,So you can kiss your park and four years of work goodbye.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,Up to you.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,Come on.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,You can do it.,5,8
Leslie Knope,I don't want to.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,You can You can do it.,5,8
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, this has been a strange day.",5,8
Ben Wyatt,But we wouldn't want to leave you with the wrong impression of Pawnee.,5,8
Andy Dwyer,Have you guys seen Hitler?,5,8
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, we would love to have you design the park, and in the spirit of reconciliation, Leslie would like to apologize.",5,8
Leslie Knope,"I may have allowed my prejudices, my totally legitimate prejudices against Eagleton affect my feelings towards your involvement in this project, and so therefore, I would like to say that I'm I'm I'm Leslie Knope.",5,8
Leslie Knope,No.,5,8
Leslie Knope,That's not what I want to say.,5,8
Leslie Knope,Okay.,5,8
Leslie Knope,My mouth is kinda dry.,5,8

Kathryn Pinewood,Is that a threat?,5,10
Ken Hotate,"Why, yes, I thought that was obvious.",5,10

Jeremy Jamm,That sounds highly offensive.,5,10
Ken Hotate,"Does it, white man?",5,10

Jeremy Jamm,It's not offensive.,5,10
Jeremy Jamm,So let's do it.,5,10

Ann Perkins,I went skydiving.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,Which Ann is screaming like a maniac?,5,12
Ben Wyatt,Oatmeal Ann or catfish Ann?,5,12
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, because I instantly blacked out from extreme terror.",5,12
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I have an idea for your blog.",5,12
Leslie Knope,I think you should take yourself iceskating.,5,12
Ann Perkins,That sounds fun.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll do a double date: You and you, and me and Ben.",5,12
Leslie Knope,"But I have to warn you, I'm very good at iceskating.",5,12
Leslie Knope,I can do jumps.,5,12
Leslie Knope,You know what?,5,12
Leslie Knope,I probably shouldn't come.,5,12
Leslie Knope,I'll embarrass the both of you.,5,12
Ann Perkins,"Actually, I know what my next activity is gonna be.",5,12
Ann Perkins,And it's a biggie.,5,12
Ann Perkins,I want to be a mom.,5,12
Ann Perkins,I'm going to the sperm bank today.,5,12
Ann Perkins,Can you come?,5,12
Leslie Knope,"Wow, today?",5,12
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you know that I fully support any woman's decision especially a beautiful unicorn nurse like yourself in creating the family that she wants.",5,12
Leslie Knope,But you are so brilliant and kind and stupid hot.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're definitely gonna find a wonderful guy who loves you and respects you and fills your home with multiethnic genius babies.",5,12
Ann Perkins,"Maybe, or maybe not.",5,12
Ann Perkins,"You hit the lottery with Ben, and that's great, but not everybody's so lucky.",5,12
Ann Perkins,"I've wanted to be a mom for a long time, I'm ready, and I think I'd be good at it.",5,12
Leslie Knope,Ann is giving up on love and deciding to have a baby with herself.,5,12
Leslie Knope,And she has only been dating herself for six weeks.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"If she were dating a guy for six weeks, and they decided to have a kid, I'd be like, ""Congratulations, Ann And Channing Tatum.""",5,12
Leslie Knope,Because that is the only scenario that would make sense to me.,5,12
Chris Traeger,What a gorgeous herbaceous medley.,5,12
Ron Swanson,There's been a mistake.,5,12
Ron Swanson,You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats.,5,12
Extra,Salad is traditionally the first course at a wedding.,5,12
Ron Swanson,Is a gerbil marrying a rabbit?,5,12
Ben Wyatt,I'm in charge of food for the wedding.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,So I brought in Pawnee's three best caterers and a panel of experts.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,Chris loves vegetables.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,Ron loves meat.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,"And Tom considers himself a foodie, which apparently means taking instagrams of food instead of eating it.",5,12
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so I liked number one, Chris liked number two, and Ron liked number three.",5,12
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, what about you?",5,12
Tom Haverford,"Caterer number one's presentation was simple, mm, yet exhausting.",5,12
Tom Haverford,"Number two's was subtle and provocative, like a coy Dutch woman guarding a dark secret.",5,12
Ben Wyatt,Nothing you're saying is helpful.,5,12
Tom Haverford,But number three's told a story a story from a book I wouldn't read but I would watch the movie of.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,That's nonsense.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,You know what?,5,12
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna go with the first place.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,I really loved that appetizer.,5,12
Chris Traeger,"Oh, the mini calzone?",5,12
Ben Wyatt,I wouldn't call it that.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,It was more like a savory pastry.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,"Delicate little dough pocket filled with tomato sauce, cheese, and seasoned meat.",5,12
Ben Wyatt,Just a stunning culinary innovation.,5,12
Ron Swanson,It was a calzone.,5,12
Chris Traeger,It was literally just a small calzone.,5,12
Extra,Let me just get some details for your file.,5,12
Extra,"Now, are you two a couple?",5,12
Leslie Knope,No.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"Tragically, we are both heterosexual.",5,12

Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong, and he turned out to be a lying drug user.",5,12
Leslie Knope,Or a hero.,5,12
Leslie Knope,I don't know where we stand on him now.,5,12
Joe From Sewage,"Hello, ladies.",5,12
Joe From Sewage,Fancy meeting you here.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, Sewage Joe.",5,12
Ann Perkins,Wow.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you remember Joe Fantringham.",5,12
Leslie Knope,He is the gentleman who was fired for emailing a picture of his penis to every woman in city hall.,5,12
Joe From Sewage,Guilty.,5,12
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what the judge said.",5,12
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you are a donor here, huh?",5,12
Leslie Knope,"Did you hear that, Ann?",5,12
Joe From Sewage,"Big time, me and all my buddies.",5,12
Joe From Sewage,"Free money, free porn.",5,12
Joe From Sewage,Best job I ever had.,5,12
Joe From Sewage,"Also If you're looking to buy some weed, I'm looking as well.",5,12
Leslie Knope,Shall we?,5,12
Ann Perkins,Yup.,5,12
April Ludgate,"Okay, Leslie Knope outfit number eight.",5,12
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, you look super hot.",5,12
Donna Meagle,You realize you've said that about all of them?,5,12
Andy Dwyer,"Well, she has, every single time.",5,12
Andy Dwyer,'Cause she is super hot.,5,12
Andy Dwyer,"Honestly, you'd look hot naked.",5,12
April Ludgate,Ugh.,5,12
April Ludgate,This suit makes me want to scold a Catholic child.,5,12
April Ludgate,"I don't know who Ann Taylor is, but I hate her and I want to kill her.",5,12
April Ludgate,"I have to lead a public forum for the Pawnee Commons every day this week, and I hate talking to people.",5,12
April Ludgate,"So, to get through it, I figured I'm just gonna basically try to imitate Leslie.",5,12
April Ludgate,She still wears this.,5,12
April Ludgate,She had the patch sewn in.,5,12
April Ludgate,You can't remove it.,5,12
April Ludgate,"What's in the pocket, you ask?",5,12
April Ludgate,"A ticket stub from a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1995, and",5,12
Donna Meagle,"This one is terrible, but it is slightly less terrible than the rest.",5,12
April Ludgate,"So tomorrow, I lead a public forum in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac sex pants.",5,12
Andy Dwyer,Fleetwood Mac Sex Pants.,5,12
Andy Dwyer,New band name.,5,12
Andy Dwyer,I call it.,5,12
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, you know what?",5,12

Ann Perkins,So what's the next move?,5,12
Ann Perkins,"Is there, like, a better sperm bank in Eagleton or something?",5,12
Leslie Knope,"Um, you don't want a demon baby.",5,12
Leslie Knope,"Look, you're Ann Perkins.",5,12
Leslie Knope,Sperm that is worthy of your perfect eggs does not grow on trees.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"I think, ideally, you'd want to know the guy, right?",5,12
Leslie Knope,"You'd want to know his personality, his favorite season of Friends, whether or not he hates jazz hopefully, he does.",5,12
Leslie Knope,You'd want to know him.,5,12
Ann Perkins,"Yes, Leslie, you're totally right.",5,12
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna make a list of all the guys I already know who could be donors.",5,12
Ann Perkins,"And then, I'm gonna call them and tell them I'm doing some blog entry on men's health or something.",5,12
Ann Perkins,I can interview them and ask them whatever I want.,5,12
Ann Perkins,You're a genius!,5,12
Ann Perkins,"This is your idea, and I love it.",5,12
Ann Perkins,I'll call you later.,5,12
Leslie Knope,No.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"If I don't slow this baby train down, Ann may end up having a baby with some random weirdo instead of her soul mate.",5,12
Leslie Knope,I fully believe that a woman should be in charge of what happens to her body.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"In this case, the body is Ann's, and the woman in charge of it is me.",5,12
Ann Perkins,I was up all night brainstorming and this is the complete official list of candidates for Ann's baby daddy.,5,12
Leslie Knope,"Wow, how did you come up with these three names?",5,12
Ann Perkins,"Well, I eliminated everyone in a relationship and the obvious ""No"" s, like Knucklehair Dave from HR.",5,12
Ann Perkins,I don't mind the knuckle hair.,5,12
Ann Perkins,I just think he's a dick.,5,12
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,5,12
Ann Perkins,And I was left with those three guys.,5,12
Ann Perkins,"Don't forget, they don't know about the sperm donor thing.",5,12
Ann Perkins,I don't want them to know.,5,12
Ann Perkins,I told them I was interviewing them for a blog.,5,12

Ron Swanson,He might have just disappeared off the earth.,5,12
Chris Traeger,We need to call him.,5,12
Chris Traeger,We must reach out to him.,5,12
Chris Traeger,I can't do it.,5,12
Ron Swanson,"Ben, extension 7820.",5,12

Leslie Knope,Wow.,5,12
Leslie Knope,That son of a bitch is astute.,5,12

The Douche,"You know, the douche persona is something I came up with during college.",5,12
The Douche,"It started as satire, and, you know, we snowballed to where we are today.",5,12
The Douche,"I mean, I know it's a silly thing to do, but it pays the bills.",5,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think, you probably need to get back to the studio, play some fart jokes, make fun of some immigrants.",5,12
The Douche,"Actually, a farting immigrant segment would be really funny.",5,12
The Douche,"Ay dios Good looking out, Leslie.",5,12
The Douche,"You guys ever want to do this again, sans clothing, give me a shout.",5,12

Ann Perkins,I can't believe you did that to me.,5,12
Ann Perkins,"I am making a very important life decision, and you betrayed me.",5,12

Leslie Knope,"I know you're frustrated with dating, and you think you're not gonna meet someone, but two years ago, I didn't think I would meet someone like Ben, and I did.",5,12
Ann Perkins,My idea of a perfect family does not require a soul mate.,5,12
Ann Perkins,"I want a baby, that's it, accept it.",5,12
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do we have a meeting?",5,12

Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm feeling so much better.",5,12
Chris Traeger,Almost no weird stuff snuck out of my body last night.,5,12
Ron Swanson,And I feel like the emptiness of my stomach is gonna lead to a pretty epic breakfast.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, what do I do?",5,12
Ben Wyatt,"My choice almost killed us, and we can't agree on another one, so",5,12
Chris Traeger,Maybe there's a catering company in Snerling that we should look into.,5,12
Ben Wyatt,"No, it has to be from Pawnee.",5,12
Ben Wyatt,I just know that's what Leslie wants.,5,12
Tom Haverford,I got it.,5,12

Tom Haverford,What do I do?,5,14
Jerry Gergich,"You know what, Tom? Just speak from the heart, okay? You'll do great.",5,14
Tom Haverford,We are gathered here tonight to join Leslie Knope and Benjamin Wyatt in marriage.,5,14
Tom Haverford,It's been a long and winding road for these two lovebirds.,5,14
Tom Haverford,And they're so impatient to begin their lives together they've moved their wedding date up three months.,5,14
Tom Haverford,"So I say, let's keep it short and sweet.",5,14
April Ludgate,"Yes, just do it already.",5,14
Tom Haverford,"I assume, and hope, you prepared your own vows? Ben, you want to say some stuff about Leslie?",5,14
Ben Wyatt,"In my time working for the state government, my job sent me to 46 cities in 11 years.",5,14
Ben Wyatt,"I lived in villages with eight people, rural farming communities, college towns.",5,14
Ben Wyatt,I was sent to every corner of Indiana.,5,14
Ben Wyatt,And then I came here.,5,14
Ben Wyatt,"And I realized that, this whole time, I was just wandering around, everywhere, just looking for you.",5,14
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, do you want to say some stuff about Ben now?",5,14
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages.",5,14
Leslie Knope,But I don't have them with me today.,5,14
Leslie Knope,Although maybe there's a copy of them in my office.,5,14
April Ludgate,No.,5,14

Andy Dwyer,"Just this once, I thought I nailed something.",5,14
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm still proud of you.",5,14
April Ludgate,You worked hard and you got really close.,5,14
Andy Dwyer,Close only counts in horse grenades.,5,14
April Ludgate,What?,5,14
Andy Dwyer,It's a saying.,5,14
Andy Dwyer,"Because if you're playing horseshoes, and then you throw a grenade at a horse, it doesn't have to be that close, and you can still blow the horse's legs off.",5,14
Andy Dwyer,It's from the movie Seabiscuit.,5,14
Chris Traeger,How's it going in here?,5,14
April Ludgate,Good.,5,14
April Ludgate,I was just telling Andy that I'm proud of him.,5,14
Andy Dwyer,Oh.,5,14
Andy Dwyer,"And I was just explaining to April that I'm a failure, and she should leave me for Orin.",5,14
Chris Traeger,"Andy, this is a very important moment for you.",5,14
Chris Traeger,How we deal with tragedy defines who we are.,5,14
Chris Traeger,I used to be terrible at it.,5,14
Chris Traeger,Beyond terrible.,5,14
Chris Traeger,You are not going to let this deflate you.,5,14
Chris Traeger,"You are going to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and we will figure out what the next step is.",5,14
Ann Perkins,Chris can be very Paternal.,5,14
Andy Dwyer,I look around this room.,5,14
Andy Dwyer,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, none of us would be here.",5,14
Andy Dwyer,"So, Leslie, this song, which is for Li'l Sebastian, is for you.",5,14
Donna Meagle,"Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing you trade your legs for angel's wings and once we've all said good-bye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly",5,14
Andy Dwyer,"Bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian, miss you in the saddest fashion",5,14
Leslie Knope,There were a lot of signs that Ben and I miss you in the saddest fashion should get married tonight.,5,14
Leslie Knope,"But, truth be told, we just really wanted to get married.",5,14
Leslie Knope,"When you're in love, everything seems like a sign.",5,14
Leslie Knope,I love my husband.,5,14
Leslie Knope,I love my job.,5,14
Leslie Knope,And I love my friends.,5,14
Leslie Knope,Even though they really can't handle their booze.,5,14
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, we should just go, right?",5,14
Ben Wyatt,Careful.,5,14
Andy Dwyer,Spread your wings and fly spread your wings and fly,5,14
Ron Swanson,It's not rocket science.,5,14
Ron Swanson,"I removed the sconce Fired up my grandfather's torch, heated up the pieces in a cast-iron bucket.",5,14
Ron Swanson,Liquefied the metal.,5,14
Ron Swanson,Pour it into a mold.,5,14
Ron Swanson,Obviously keep it over a low flame to achieve a nice temper.,5,14
Ron Swanson,Cooled it in antifreeze.,5,14
Ron Swanson,And just forged and shaped the rings.,5,14
Ron Swanson,"Any moron with a crucible, an acetylene torch, and a cast-iron waffle maker could have done the same.",5,14
Ron Swanson,Whole thing only took me about 20 minutes.,5,14
Ron Swanson,People who buy things are suckers.,5,14

Ann Perkins,"No, I don't think so.",5,15
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, what if he thinks I'm asking too much of him, and I ask him to plant the ficuses, and he doesn't want to, and he gets weird about it, and it ruins our friendship?",5,15

Tom Haverford,I'm outtie.,5,15
Tom Haverford,"Great job, team.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,What?,5,15
April Ludgate,"Ever since Andy failed the police exam, he's been really depressed.",5,15
April Ludgate,Picking out a dumb charity is the most excited he's been in weeks.,5,15
April Ludgate,You're so selfish.,5,15
Ben Wyatt,Selfish?,5,15
Ben Wyatt,I'm running a charity.,5,15

Leslie Knope,"But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month.",5,15
Chris Traeger,There is nothing more disgusting than an invasion of privacy.,5,15
Chris Traeger,And I should know.,5,15
Chris Traeger,I've had many women steal my undershirts.,5,15
Leslie Knope,I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.,5,15
Leslie Knope,"So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever.",5,15
Leslie Knope,I need to know what they might use against me.,5,15
Ron Swanson,You can't hack into a typewriter.,5,15
Ron Swanson,That's all I have to say.,5,15

Andy Dwyer,Oh.,5,15
Ben Wyatt,"I just wanted to thank you so much for your help, Andy.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,Sorry we didn't wind up choosing the after school music program.,5,15
Andy Dwyer,I totally get it.,5,15

Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's exactly right.",5,15
Extra,"Your morning tea, Mr. Wyatt.",5,15
Andy Dwyer,Imagine all the money you could save if you didn't have to pay for this expensive stuff.,5,15

Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's also exactly right.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I should have thought of that.,5,15
Andy Dwyer,"Well, let me tell you something else that's interesting, Ben.",5,15

Chris Traeger,I am touched and honored that you would even consider me to be the father of your child.,5,15
Chris Traeger,And I'm glad that you came right out and said it.,5,15
Chris Traeger,"I mean, if we're really considering this, then we have to start at a place of complete honesty.",5,15
Ann Perkins,You're right.,5,15
Ann Perkins,And I'll start now.,5,15
Ann Perkins,You are a great specimen.,5,15
Ann Perkins,That's a terrible choice of words.,5,15
Ann Perkins,If my baby turned out to be anything like you I'd be lucky.,5,15
Chris Traeger,Can I have just a little bit of time to think about it?,5,15
Ann Perkins,"Of course, yes.",5,15
Ann Perkins,Take as much time as you want.,5,15
Ann Perkins,"Or just maybe, like, a couple days.",5,15
Ann Perkins,'Cause I'm getting antsy.,5,15
Ann Perkins,And I'm ovulating on Thursday.,5,15
Ann Perkins,"So, chop-chop.",5,15
Ann Perkins,But take your time.,5,15

Ann Perkins,You were absolutely and totally right.,5,15
Ron Swanson,I know.,5,15
Ron Swanson,Stop talking and get out.,5,15
Ann Perkins,Yep.,5,15
Jessica Wicks,The redneck ambulance is a great choice.,5,15
Jessica Wicks,We can release a publicity shot of a bucktoothed hayseed taking medicine for the first time in his life.,5,15
Ben Wyatt,We can figure out the photo later.,5,15
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, I forgot! It's Fondue Friday.",5,15
Jessica Wicks,Yay!,5,15
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, also, as President of the foundation, I'm making a few changes.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,I'm giving up this office.,5,15
Ben Wyatt,And no more visits from a masseuse or fancy lunches.,5,15
Ben Wyatt,It's way out of hand.,5,15
Jessica Wicks,"Sweetie, all the money we spend on the foundation is tax deductible.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,"I know, and it's a huge waste of money.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, there's plenty of cheap office space around.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,And I have an idea for how to use some of the money we'll save.,5,15
Jessica Wicks,Get yourself a matching nude portrait? I can call the painter.,5,15
Ben Wyatt,Please don't.,5,15
Leslie Knope,"First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs.",5,15
Leslie Knope,I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find.,5,15
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is it chocolate?,5,15
Leslie Knope,Even better.,5,15
Leslie Knope,It's dirt.,5,15
Leslie Knope,"The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, ""Minimal acceptable standards.""",5,15
Leslie Knope,So not too shabby.,5,15
Kim Terlando,"Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed construction will take 18 months, but a source tells me it will be much longer.",5,15
Leslie Knope,I would I would deny that report.,5,15
Kim Terlando,I've also learned that the EPA found midi-chlorians in the soil.,5,15
Kim Terlando,"How serious is that, exactly?",5,15
Leslie Knope,"It's very serious, Kim.",5,15
Leslie Knope,"It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks.",5,15
Leslie Knope,I really thought you guys would gasp there.,5,15
Kim Terlando,That is a baseless accusation.,5,15
Leslie Knope,Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.,5,15
Leslie Knope,"Which, side-note, was a terrible movie.",5,15
Leslie Knope,"It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband.",5,15
Leslie Knope,But that is neither here nor there.,5,15
Donna Meagle,"The point is I sent Councilwoman Knope the fake email about the EPA finding midi-chlorians, an hour ago As a trap.",5,15
Donna Meagle,Into which you have fallen.,5,15
Kim Terlando,"Well I have never seen Star Wars, because I was too busy hooking up with guys.",5,15
Kim Terlando,Unlike you losers.,5,15
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you wanna compare numbers, Terlando? Get to steppin'.",5,15
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes.",5,15
Leslie Knope,So I spent the whole night writing new ones.,5,15
Leslie Knope,"Lucky for you, let's get started.",5,15
Leslie Knope,I'm very excited to be here.,5,15
Leslie Knope,You know who else is excited to be here?,5,15
Leslie Knope,Neve Campbell.,5,15
Donna Meagle,"Oh, boy.",5,15
Leslie Knope,What a great party of five.,5,15
Donna Meagle,"All right, thank you, guys.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, I could use someone to help me at the foundation as a part-time assistant but also an idea man.",5,15
Andy Dwyer,Might I suggest Tom? He loves ideas.,5,15
Andy Dwyer,Also a man.,5,15
Ben Wyatt,"What No, Andy, I've already chosen the person.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,And it is not Tom,5,15
Andy Dwyer,Then who is it?,5,15
Andy Dwyer,"Well, he is, uh, sitting right here in this courtyard.",5,15
Andy Dwyer,That guy? Do you even know him?,5,15
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, Andy, it's you.",5,15
Ben Wyatt,I think you may have a knack for charitable giving.,5,15

Dennis Lerpiss,It's about three men who refuse to go on a suicide mission and are executed for cowardice.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie.",5,16
Leslie Knope,One that's a little bit more upbeat.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Like Finding Nemo or,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"I could do, uh, Shoah.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Okay,Paths Of Glory it is.",5,16
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee Videodome.,5,16
Leslie Knope,And we are here because I started a program to help local business.,5,16
Leslie Knope,This is a Pawnee institution.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd.",5,16
Perd Hapley,"It's a heartwarming story, but it's just not believable.",5,16
Perd Hapley,Which is why I give E.T. 1 and a 1/2 stars.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's over.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Get up, Andy.",5,16
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?,5,16
Andy Dwyer,What's everybody where are we?,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,The reason I love that film is that it's really depressing.,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"Speaking of which, sadly, next month, Pawnee Videodome will be closing its doors.",5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,Forever.,5,16
Leslie Knope,No!,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"For those of you that have attended our screenings, I want to thank you for your patronage, though I wish you would have rented more movies.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Sir, will you rent something?",5,16
Morris,Why would I do that?,5,16
Morris,All movies are online for free.,5,16
Morris,I'm watching Iron Man 2 on my phone right now.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you're not helping.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo.",5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"Ooh, we don't carry cartoons.",5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"But if you want a film about the ocean, we have a documentary about the brutality of Japan's whaling industry.",5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,It's called Tears Of My Blowhole.,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,And it's it's nauseating.,5,16
Leslie Knope,I'll just buy some red vines.,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, we only have Japanese slime candy and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls.",5,16
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, seriously, where are we?",5,16
Chris Traeger,All these kids have fathers and mothers who have birthed them and are guiding them through life.,5,16
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, that's how it works.",5,16
Ben Wyatt,How are you feeling?,5,16
Ben Wyatt,Did you make your dadcision yet?,5,16
Chris Traeger,I am 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I'm going to do.,5,16
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins asked me if I would like to donate sperm, so she can have a baby.",5,16
Chris Traeger,It's a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyzing fear of negatively affecting any living thing.,5,16
Tom Haverford,There's 60 dollars missing from the register.,5,16
Tom Haverford,I think MonaLisa's stealing from me.,5,16
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yeah, it is absolutely MonaLisa.",5,16
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She's a total klepto.,5,16
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And nympho and pyro all those things.,5,16
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as your CFO, I recommend getting rid of her immediately.",5,16
Tom Haverford,I'm throwing a huge cocktail party tomorrow for all my best clients.,5,16
Tom Haverford,I don't have time to find someone new.,5,16
Tom Haverford,This sucks.,5,16
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when I was in high school, we had to spend a week carrying around a sack of flour, pretending it was a kid.",5,16
Ben Wyatt,"Why don't you make Tom your sack of flour, see how it feels to parent him a little?",5,16
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that is literally the greatest idea in human history.",5,16
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I heard ""sack of flour"" and ""high school.""",5,16
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Are you dingdongs making fake drugs for sophomores?,5,16
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because if true, this guy wants in.",5,16
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, just have Mr. Traeger call me when he gets back in.",5,16
Ann Perkins,"Actually, you know what?",5,16
Ann Perkins,Don't tell him that I called.,5,16
Ann Perkins,"Just when he gets there, can you text me and tell me he's back?",5,16
Ann Perkins,You know what?,5,16
Ann Perkins,"Let's just pretend this didn't happen, okay?",5,16
Ann Perkins,This is Jerry Gergich calling.,5,16
Ann Perkins,Bye.,5,16
April Ludgate,I have to tell you a secret.,5,16
April Ludgate,"But if you tell anyone, I will kill you slowly with a giant syringe.",5,16
Ann Perkins,"Good morning, April.",5,16
Ann Perkins,What's your secret?,5,16
April Ludgate,I'm thinking about applying to veterinary school in Bloomington.,5,16
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, April, that's great!",5,16
Ann Perkins,Whoa!,5,16
Ann Perkins,Where'd you get that?,5,16
April Ludgate,The Internet.,5,16
April Ludgate,So I really need a letter of recommendation.,5,16
April Ludgate,"And since you work in a hospital, as a janitor",5,16
Ann Perkins,Nurse.,5,16
April Ludgate,I was wondering if maybe you would write one for me?,5,16
Ann Perkins,Really?,5,16
Ann Perkins,"Generally, between us, April always has the upper hand.",5,16
Ann Perkins,And that hand is usually giving me the finger or pouring honey in my purse.,5,16
Ann Perkins,But now I have the upper hand.,5,16
Ann Perkins,And I'm going to use it to crush her Into being nice to me.,5,16
Ann Perkins,I would be happy to write you that letter.,5,16
Ann Perkins,I actually know the guy who runs the veterinary program over there.,5,16
April Ludgate,Because you hooked up with him?,5,16
Ann Perkins,I don't hook up with everyone I know.,5,16
Ann Perkins,"Although, yes, we did hook up.",5,16
Ann Perkins,"But before I write you that letter, you have to spend the next week with me and do everything I say.",5,16
April Ludgate,So I have to be your slave or something?,5,16
Ann Perkins,"No, you have to be my friend.",5,16
April Ludgate,"No, that is so much worse.",5,16
Ann Perkins,Don't do that.,5,16
Leslie Knope,I think I have a plan of how to save your store.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat.",5,16
Ron Swanson,That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market.",5,16
Leslie Knope,But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.,5,16
Leslie Knope,That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.,5,16
Leslie Knope,But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.,5,16
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.,5,16
Ron Swanson,This man is a failure.,5,16
Ron Swanson,He is not up to snuff.,5,16
Ron Swanson,"His business is failing, and you're bailing it out.",5,16
Ron Swanson,"This is a bailout, and I don't like it.",5,16
Ron Swanson,And there are some pretty intellectual conversations down at Barrett's Hardware.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"You may get a little heat for this, okay?",5,16
Leslie Knope,So use your money wisely.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Get popular films that people wanna see.,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"Like, uh, get the Tarkovsky movies with the subtitles.",5,16
Leslie Knope,No.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Like Pixar.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Reese Witherspoon.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay.",5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,What?,5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"No, no.",5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,No.,5,16
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I have something I need to talk to you about.",5,16
Tom Haverford,Do we need to sit like this?,5,16
Chris Traeger,Yes.,5,16
Chris Traeger,MonaLisa's taking advantage of you.,5,16
Chris Traeger,And I'm sure that it's not easy when it's the sister of a dear friend.,5,16
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, it's not that.",5,16
Tom Haverford,She scares the crap out of me.,5,16
Tom Haverford,I once saw her punch a police horse in the face.,5,16
Chris Traeger,"Speak directly to her and tell her, ""I will not be disrespected.""",5,16
Chris Traeger,You're Tom Haverford.,5,16
Chris Traeger,"You're a smart, successful young man with an adorable, little belly.",5,16
Chris Traeger,Stand up for yourself.,5,16
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'll talk to her before the party.",5,16
Tom Haverford,"And if she murders me, tell JeanRalphio to clear my browser history.",5,16
Tom Haverford,"Thanks for the advice, man.",5,16
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.,5,16
Chris Traeger,Son.,5,16
Tom Haverford,What's that?,5,16
Chris Traeger,Nothing.,5,16
Tom Haverford,All right.,5,16
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.,5,16
Andy Dwyer,And my second Bruce Lee movie.,5,16
Andy Dwyer,"And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest.",5,16
Andy Dwyer,"And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded.",5,16
Andy Dwyer,And hornets came out.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Andy,5,16
Andy Dwyer,"The point is, obviously, you do not throw rocks at a hornet's nest.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons.",5,16
Leslie Knope,Any other comments here before we Ron?,5,16
Leslie Knope,What are you doing at a city council meeting?,5,16
Leslie Knope,Are you lost?,5,16
Leslie Knope,Are you hurt?,5,16
Ron Swanson,"No, I am here to express an opinion.",5,16
Ron Swanson,This action by Councilwoman Knope is nothing more than a thinly veiled government bailout.,5,16
Ron Swanson,"And I, for one, refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape.",5,16
Ron Swanson,Allow me to elaborate.,5,16
Ron Swanson,The government should not prop up a failed business.,5,16
Ron Swanson,That would be like giving food to a mortally wounded animal instead of slitting its throat and properly utilizing its meat and pelt.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Please stop talking about wounded meat.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.,5,16
Leslie Knope,A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.,5,16
Ron Swanson,You rented Rashomon?,5,16
Ron Swanson,What was your favorite part of that?,5,16
Leslie Knope,"I haven't rented it, actually, yet.",5,16
Leslie Knope,But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.,5,16
Morris,"Uh, you can just watch it online, for free, whenever you want.",5,16
Leslie Knope,Bailiff!,5,16
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?",5,16
Leslie Knope,Mm.,5,16
Extra,How much to rent this jacket?,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Oh.,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Curly Sue, that jacket is so ugly.",5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,You should just take it.,5,16
Tom Haverford,"It's 15 for the day, 40 for the week. Thank you.",5,16
Tom Haverford,We appreciate your business.,5,16
Tom Haverford,MonaLisa!,5,16
Tom Haverford,Did you order the champagne for the client party tonight?,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Did I order the what for the what what what, what?",5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What are you even talking about right now?,5,16
Tom Haverford,"Okay, we need to discuss your work habits.",5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, sure, but after I take a quick nap because ecstasy takes forever to leave my system",5,16
Tom Haverford,No.,5,16
Tom Haverford,We're doing this now.,5,16
Tom Haverford,You need to start putting in more of an effort and start respecting my authority around here!,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Or else what?,5,16
Tom Haverford,Or else I'll fire you.,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What did you just say?,5,16
Tom Haverford,"I said, if you don't shape up, I'll fire you.",5,16
Tom Haverford,Do you understand?,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"You are so freaking sexy right now, I could crap my pants.",5,16
Tom Haverford,Ugh.,5,16
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?,5,16
Ann Perkins,"I guess it would have to be Channing Tatum's body, Ryan Gosling's face, and Michael Fassbender's sense of humor.",5,16
Ann Perkins,What about you?,5,16
Ann Perkins,Build your perfect guy.,5,16
April Ludgate,"Um Yao Ming's torso, Napoleon's brain, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame's hunchback.",5,16
April Ludgate,Do you like my nails?,5,16
Ann Perkins,"Even though she hides it underneath layers of sarcasm, resentment, and grumpiness, I know, deep down somewhere, April likes me.",5,16
Ann Perkins,I'm kind of just fracking for friendship.,5,16
Extra,"Gene Strackwell, owner of Strackwell Hardware.",5,16
Extra,Is there a form I need to fill out for the bailout?,5,16
Leslie Knope,We're not bailing anyone out.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.,5,16
Extra,We've been around way longer than that stupid art house movie bullcrap.,5,16
Extra,And people need places to buy tools.,5,16
Morris,"Uh, you can just buy tools online.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Bailiff, why is he back in here?",5,16
Leslie Knope,How did you get back in here?,5,16
Morris,I'll see myself out.,5,16
Morris,Don't worry about it.,5,16
Joe From Sewage,I heard you were giving out free money.,5,16
Joe From Sewage,"I need $3,000.",5,16
Joe From Sewage,Minimum.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan.",5,16
Joe From Sewage,"What would you do if one of your citizens was about to come into some serious physical harm Unless he got 3,000 dollars?",5,16
Leslie Knope,I'd call the police.,5,16
Joe From Sewage,You cannot call the police.,5,16
Extra,"Wilson Gromling of the ""Liberty or Die"" party.",5,16
Extra,These government handouts are deplorable.,5,16
Extra,You're just handing out blank checks.,5,16
Extra,I was on food stamps.,5,16
Extra,I was on Welfare.,5,16
Extra,And nobody ever helped me.,5,16
Leslie Knope,This is not a blank check.,5,16
Leslie Knope,I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.,5,16
Leslie Knope,"In a few days, Dennis will reopen.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved.",5,16
Councilman Howser,Are there any other comments?,5,16
Extra,Yes.,5,16
Extra,"The Pawnee chapter of the ""Liberty or Die"" party has hit some hard times.",5,16
Extra,We were wondering if maybe the town could loan us some money.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.,5,16
Chris Traeger,"Tom, how did it go with MonaLisa?",5,16
Tom Haverford,"I told her she needed to change her attitude, or I was gonna have to fire her.",5,16
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that is very responsible and mature.",5,16
Ben Wyatt,She took it well?,5,16
Tom Haverford,Um yeah.,5,16
Tom Haverford,"For some reason, she got super turned on.",5,16
Tom Haverford,We started making out.,5,16
Tom Haverford,Hard.,5,16
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know, we're back at my place, having sex.",5,16
Tom Haverford,We're together now.,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, bitch, I need to borrow some money to do something that is none of your damn beeswax, namely, I need to wax my bee.",5,16
Tom Haverford,Here you go.,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'd still hit it.,5,16
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm coolin' on you.,5,16

Dennis Lerpiss,"Got rid of all those dusty, old foreign films and used the money for the part of our business that's always done pretty well for us.",5,16
Dennis Lerpiss,"Give the people what they want, right?",5,16
Leslie Knope,This isn't what people want.,5,16
Andy Dwyer,It's definitely what that guy wants.,5,16
Herman,I like this store now.,5,16
Leslie Knope,Do you realize what you have done?,5,16
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee government now effectively owns a porn shop.,5,16
Leslie Knope,You have made us porn peddlers!,5,16
Brandi Maxxxx,"Hello everyone, I'm Brandi Maxxxx.",5,16
Brandi Maxxxx,Let's give a big round of applause to Councilwoman Knope for keeping this store in business!,5,16

Leslie Knope,"No, settle up.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won.",5,16
Leslie Knope,"Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money.",5,16
Ron Swanson,There is not.,5,16
Ron Swanson,The free market is a jungle.,5,16
Ron Swanson,It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.,5,16
Ron Swanson,"When a business fails, it dies, and a new, better one takes its place.",5,16

April Ludgate,He says a lot of things.,5,17
April Ludgate,"He's always talking about overthrowing the government, but he never does that.",5,17
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, that'll make a nice pull quote for the article about me taking you to the cleaners.",5,17
Extra,"Mr. Swanson, if you'd like to make a statement, you may.",5,17
Ron Swanson,"On the night I punched councilman Jamm in the face, I warned him several times to back off.",5,17
Ron Swanson,"And instead, he attacked me twice.",5,17
Ron Swanson,"Truthfully, I barely registered his attack.",5,17
Ron Swanson,"He's incredibly frail, and his arms are weak.",5,17
Ron Swanson,"And when I punched him, he dropped so quickly, I thought he was diving towards the ground.",5,17
Ron Swanson,I regret nothing.,5,17
Ron Swanson,The end.,5,17
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this turned out better than I ever imagined.",5,17

Ben Wyatt,"Mm, let me see the key.",5,17
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, they took it back.",5,17
Leslie Knope,They wanted to get it engraved.,5,17
Ben Wyatt,Huh.,5,17
Leslie Knope,"You know, the key is just a metaphor.",5,17
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the real key has been inside you all along.",5,17
Ben Wyatt,"It was a setup, wasn't it?",5,17
Ben Wyatt,They were gonna make fun of me?,5,17

Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, you know what, he's not a rack of ribs, so stop grilling him.",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,Nailed it.,5,18
Leslie Knope,"Ribs are better smoked than grilled, so unnailed it, with the back part of the hammer.",5,18

Leslie Knope,That is an insane statement.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I don't see anyone better.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"April, I got a present for you.",5,18
April Ludgate,I don't like lotion.,5,18

Leslie Knope,"I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud.",5,18
April Ludgate,Really?,5,18
April Ludgate,Thanks.,5,18
Leslie Knope,"On an unrelated note, do you remember all those candidates we were interviewing for the Animal Control job and how they were all total losers who didn't care about animals?",5,18
Leslie Knope,"Except for Jerry, who was great, but who we had to pass on for other reasons.",5,18

Leslie Knope,"No, it's easy they'll just ask you a few questions.",5,18
Leslie Knope,Let's practice.,5,18
Leslie Knope,What's your name?,5,18

Leslie Knope,"Hey, don't even joke about that.",5,18
April Ludgate,What?,5,18
April Ludgate,I really think he's wrong for you.,5,18
Councilman Howser,We now resume the confirmation proceedings for director of the Animal Control Department.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,Okay.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's tear this chick a new one, shall we?",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, we have found many emails showing how you sexually harassed Leslie Knope's assistant.",5,18
April Ludgate,Andy?,5,18
April Ludgate,That's my husband.,5,18
Councilman Dexhart,"They were still extremely graphic, and appreciated by all of us.",5,18
Councilman Dexhart,"I had never heard of several of those terms, and I'm a freak.",5,18
April Ludgate,Those are personal.,5,18
April Ludgate,No one's allowed to read those.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,You once posted a video of yourself drinking alcohol in City Hall while you were still a minor.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,How do you justify that?,5,18
April Ludgate,Easily.,5,18
April Ludgate,Alcohol is delicious and fun,5,18
Leslie Knope,Damentally a substance that should not be abused.,5,18
Leslie Knope,"I agree, April.",5,18
Leslie Knope,Very good point.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,Wow.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, are you a ventriloquist?",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that is amazing how you make your words come out of Ms. Knope's mouth.",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,Would you like to put her on your knee?,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that'd be really fun.",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Just three years ago, you drove",5,18
Chris Traeger,She is not ready.,5,18
Chris Traeger,"Now, you've rushed her into this, and now, Jamm's sharpening the knives.",5,18
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, no one needs to be jammed today.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction.",5,18
Leslie Knope,Grab that gavel and break your other foot.,5,18
Chris Traeger,"I like the idea of double the signings, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives.",5,18
Leslie Knope,Don't panic.,5,18
Leslie Knope,Maybe she can pull this off.,5,18
April Ludgate,"I guess my first move as director would be to fill your office, house, and car with snakes, and then train a crow to fly up your butt.",5,18
Leslie Knope,Okay! Let's take a brief recess.,5,18
Dennis Feinstein,"Well, well, well.",5,18
Dennis Feinstein,Look who's back.,5,18
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you so much for seeing us again, sir.",5,18

Andy Dwyer,"Mr. Dennis Feinstein, let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad.",5,18
Andy Dwyer,"I just started working here, and I really want to do a good job, and I blew it.",5,18
Dennis Feinstein,Thank you for saying that.,5,18
Dennis Feinstein,"Thought about it last night, and I decided that if you came in here and apologized to me like a man, that I would forgive you, and that's what you've done, so you're forgiven.",5,18
Dennis Feinstein,"To that end, here is a check for 25,000 dollars for your charity.",5,18
Dennis Feinstein,"Go out there and help some kids with their pink eye, or whatever it is you guys are doing.",5,18
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. Feinstein, thank you.",5,18
Ben Wyatt,This is extremely generous.,5,18
Dennis Feinstein,"It's nothing, really.",5,18
Dennis Feinstein,I'm happy to help.,5,18
Ben Wyatt,"This check is made out to ""Go [bleep] yourself.""",5,18
Dennis Feinstein,In your face! Dennis Feinstein helps no man! Get the hell out of my office!,5,18
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's your problem, man? -",5,18
Andy Dwyer,Why did you make me - apologize to him?,5,18
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, guys, just hold it-- hold on a sec, okay? Mr. Feinstein, with all due respect you are a major dick.",5,18
Dennis Feinstein,#NAME?,5,18
Ben Wyatt,Run!,5,18
Dennis Feinstein,"Eddie, get my crossbow.",5,18
Andy Dwyer,- Crossbow? What the--,5,18
Dennis Feinstein,You will pay for this!,5,18
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you look better.",5,18
Ann Perkins,I guess actual medicine can be effective.,5,18
Ann Perkins,Who'da thunk?,5,18
Ron Swanson,Please leave me alone.,5,18
Ann Perkins,Not until we go over your test results and your blood work.,5,18
Ann Perkins,Your blood pressure looks fine.,5,18
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure how this is possible, but your cholesterol is 120, which is the lowest I've ever seen.",5,18
Ron Swanson,"What's ""cholesterol""?",5,18
Ann Perkins,"And the only problem I see is that your potassium's low, so just eat a banana once in awhile.",5,18
Ron Swanson,"No, thank you.",5,18
Ron Swanson,"I live the way I live, I eat the things I eat, and I'll die the way I'll die.",5,18
Ann Perkins,That's oddly beautiful but also stupid.,5,18
Ann Perkins,"You're not alone in the world anymore, Ron.",5,18
Ann Perkins,"You're dating a woman who has two kids, so every three days, think about Ivy and Zoe and Diane, and eat a damn banana.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"I am so sorry, April.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"It's not you, it's me.",5,18
April Ludgate,Are you breaking up with me?,5,18
Leslie Knope,I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control.,5,18
Leslie Knope,I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director.,5,18
Leslie Knope,He does have good teeth.,5,18
April Ludgate,"No! All right, I have an idea.",5,18
April Ludgate,Trust me.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, it is the opinion of this committee that you are terrible.",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,Can you give me even one reason why you're the right man for this job?,5,18
April Ludgate,No.,5,18
April Ludgate,But neither is your guy.,5,18
April Ludgate,Neither of us should get the job.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, no? Why is that?",5,18
April Ludgate,There shouldn't be a separate Animal Control Department.,5,18
April Ludgate,"Its budget is tiny, and it's ineffective, and frankly, no one could change that.",5,18
April Ludgate,So I think it should be absorbed into the Parks Department.,5,18
Leslie Knope,That is a genius idea.,5,18
Leslie Knope,Somebody wake up Milton.,5,18
Leslie Knope,History is being made.,5,18
Councilman Milton,Iwo Jima!,5,18
April Ludgate,"Animal Control would be way more effective if it ran through the Parks Department, and if you want, I can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummies to understand, dummies.",5,18
Chris Traeger,"Councilman, you have to admit that that idea makes a lot of sense.",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,Hang on a second.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"You seem to be forgetting that I already told Vern he got the job, and he already bought a new speedboat.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope he kept a receipt.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec.",5,18
Councilman Howser,I second that.,5,18
Leslie Knope,Yay!,5,18
Leslie Knope,"Look at that, April.",5,18
Leslie Knope,You won over Jamm.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, no, she didn't.",5,18
Jeremy Jamm,I'm just sick of being on the losing side.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,I'm going to tell everyone this was my idea.,5,18
Jeremy Jamm,Retro-jammed.,5,18
Andy Dwyer,What do we do now? Can I apologize again? I'm getting really at apologizing.,5,18
Tom Haverford,Screw that.,5,18
Tom Haverford,You should apologize for apologizing to that guy.,5,18
Ben Wyatt,"God, we really could've used the money, though.",5,18
Ben Wyatt,Just wish we'd made a bigger impression.,5,18
Tom Haverford,"You did-- I was really impressed by all the stuff the foundation's done for all them poor homies, so you know what? Rent-A-Swag is gonna donate five cents from every dollar we make this month.",5,18
Tom Haverford,"It's not Feinstein money, but it'll help.",5,18
Ben Wyatt,"That's very generous, Tom.",5,18
Ben Wyatt,Feinstein's the worst.,5,18
Ben Wyatt,I hope he gets into an accident driving that Rolex Mobile.,5,18
Tom Haverford,"For the last time, it's a Rolexus, and you can't drive it.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"April, I have a gift for you.",5,18
Leslie Knope,Ta da.,5,18
Chris Traeger,"At Leslie's suggestion, I have made you deputy director of Animal Control within the Parks Department.",5,18
Chris Traeger,"You'll be amazing at it, and the best part, there is no confirmation hearing.",5,18
April Ludgate,How did you make this plaque so quickly?,5,18
Leslie Knope,I had it made your first week here.,5,18
Leslie Knope,"I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared.",5,18
April Ludgate,Can I hire an intern?,5,18
Leslie Knope,Not yet.,5,18
April Ludgate,Can I hire a Mexican elf?,5,18
Leslie Knope,No.,5,18
April Ludgate,Can I buy a child bride?,5,18
Leslie Knope,No.,5,18
April Ludgate,Then how is this even a promotion?,5,18
Leslie Knope,Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors.,5,18
Leslie Knope,It should operate based on good ideas.,5,18
Leslie Knope,"April had the best idea, and today the best idea won.",5,18
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I really have to go to the bathroom.",5,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, right, sorry.",5,18
Chris Traeger,You don't have to come in with me.,5,18
Leslie Knope,I wasn't going to.,5,18
Chris Traeger,Could you pick up the pace a little bit?,5,18
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Miss Daisy.",5,18

Leslie Knope,Ted!,5,19
Leslie Knope,Ted!,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Article Two, Section Two of the Pawnee Charter reads, ""Be it decreed: Should the taxation of tea ""rise to an unacceptable level, citizens shall dump Ted into Ramsett Lake.""",5,19
Leslie Knope,Does anyone object?,5,19
Theodore,"As always, I object.",5,19
Garth Blunden,"Nay, enough dithering!",5,19
Garth Blunden,Dump the miscreant!,5,19
Garth Blunden,Boo!,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"Historical fun fact when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their oldtimey script made one of the ""a""s look like a ""d,"" so ""tea"" became ""Ted.""",5,19
Leslie Knope,It's just one of those little things that reminds us of Pawnee's rich and vibrant past.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we get to go find a guy named Ted and throw him in a lake.",5,19
Leslie Knope,One!,5,19
Theodore,I don't even go by Ted!,5,19

Theodore,I go by Theodore!,5,19

Andy Dwyer,"Then you checked it, remember, and it didn't work.",5,19
Theodore,"Yeah, that was hilarious.",5,19
Theodore,"Listen, I am just here to say that I am done with Ted Party Day.",5,19
Andy Dwyer,Ha!,5,19
Andy Dwyer,Classic Ted.,5,19
Theodore,I'm serious.,5,19
Theodore,I'm not getting dumped in that lake anymore.,5,19
Theodore,"And I talked to the other Teds in town, and they're not doing it either.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year.",5,19
Leslie Knope,That's the way it's always been done.,5,19
Theodore,"Okay, first of all, ""That's the way it's always been done"" is not a good reason to keep doing something.",5,19
Theodore,"Second, it was a misprint.",5,19
Theodore,"They clearly meant ""tea.""",5,19
Leslie Knope,I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.,5,19
Theodore,"Okay, fine.",5,19
Theodore,You want to enforce every single old law we have on our books?,5,19
Theodore,"Hey, can I see your keys for a second?",5,19
Theodore,Here's a quarter.,5,19
Theodore,I own your car now.,5,19
Tom Haverford,Wha,5,19
Theodore,Sorry.,5,19
Theodore,The Pawnee Charter clearly states that any white citizen has the right to seize any Indian property for 25 cents.,5,19
Leslie Knope,That is an outdated and racist law.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"And obviously they meant ""American Indian.""",5,19
Theodore,"Whoa, I think we should be careful when we speculate what the Founders intended when they wrote the charter.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ted.",5,19
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.,5,19
Leslie Knope,You're quoting me back to me.,5,19
Leslie Knope,But I'm gonna quote me back to you and say that Ted Party Day will never change.,5,19
Theodore,Uhoh.,5,19
Theodore,"You, a woman, just raised your voice to a landowning male.",5,19
Theodore,"According to a Pawnee statute passed in 1868, I get to do this.",5,19
Leslie Knope,I was not aware of that statute.,5,19
April Ludgate,"Ron, you have to help me.",5,19
April Ludgate,Chris is making me do some stupid management training leadership course.,5,19
Chris Traeger,"Now that you run the Animal Control department, you have qualified for the Chris Traeger Management Training Seminar or ""Katumts.""",5,19
Chris Traeger,"It's not a great acronym, but it is a great seminar.",5,19
April Ludgate,Can you get me out of it?,5,19
Ron Swanson,Yes.,5,19
Ron Swanson,"Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing.",5,19
Ron Swanson,But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing.,5,19
Ron Swanson,I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.,5,19
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson and April Ludgate, literally my two favorite people in the catalogued universe.",5,19
Ron Swanson,April will not be participating in your pointless course because she has more important things to do like not participating in your pointless course.,5,19
Chris Traeger,I just want April to become as great a department head as yourself.,5,19
Ron Swanson,Which is why this is pointless.,5,19
Ron Swanson,"I've been head of the Parks department for 12 years, and I never had any ""management training"" course.",5,19
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've never been ""katumtsed?""",5,19
Chris Traeger,I am legally required to katumts every department head.,5,19
Chris Traeger,"Otherwise, we are open to all kinds of liability.",5,19
Ron Swanson,What are you saying?,5,19
Chris Traeger,"I'm saying that tomorrow during the seminar, April is going to have a classmate.",5,19
Chris Traeger,And spoiler alert,5,19
April Ludgate,it's Alf.,5,19
Chris Traeger,It's you.,5,19
Ron Swanson,This went poorly.,5,19

Leslie Knope,"The bill that I have written with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete laws such as all menstruating women shall be confined to their bathtubs and Article Two, aka, Ted Party Day.",5,19

Garth Blunden,Thank you.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"My name is Garth Blunden, and I object to your ridiculous proposal.",5,19
Garth Blunden,The Pawnee Charter shall not be changed.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"Not today, not ever!",5,19
Leslie Knope,"Wow, a lot of passion, Mr. Blunden.",5,19
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Your objection is noted and officially in the record.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Shall we proceed to a vote?,5,19
Garth Blunden,No.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"No, we shall not.",5,19
Garth Blunden,"Article Seven, Section Three allows for a ""Citizen filibuster.""",5,19
Garth Blunden,"If I stand here and refuse to yield my time, you are prohibited from voting on the bill.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"That section defines ""Buffalo meat"" as acceptable currency.",5,19
Garth Blunden,Is that the Buffalo meat one?,5,19
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"I meant Article Three, Section Seven.",5,19
Garth Blunden,Let the filibustering begin.,5,19
Garth Blunden,I would now like to share some ideas I have for J.J. Abrams' seventh chapter in the Star Wars' saga.,5,19
Garth Blunden,Pan down from the twin suns of Tatooine.,5,19
Garth Blunden,We are now close on the mouth of the Sarlacc Pit.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"After a beat, the gloved Mandalorian armor gauntlet of Boba Fett grabs onto the sand outside of the Sarlacc Pit and the feared bounty hunter pulls himself from the maw of the sand beast.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, he's right.",5,19
Leslie Knope,He can do this.,5,19
Leslie Knope,This is exactly why we need to modernize these laws.,5,19
Leslie Knope,This kind of thing made sense when we had council in a barn and there were but now this is nuts.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"If he holds the reality gem, that means he can jump from different realities.",5,19
Garth Blunden,This will be our link to the Marvel Universe from the Star Wars Universe.,5,19
Garth Blunden,Imagine those who were up against Chewbacca 'cause that's gonna happen.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"After a beat, Luke says, ""Darth Vader was my father, but Ben Kenobi was my master.""",5,19
Garth Blunden,And he cuts Hannibal Lecter in half.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Blunden, look, the laws I'm trying to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and they're embarrassing to Pawnee.",5,19
Leslie Knope,Repealing them would show that we're changing with the times.,5,19
Garth Blunden,You can't just change the charter willynilly.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"You start by casually repealing a couple of ""old laws,"" the next thing you know, your jackbooted storm troopers are kicking in my door and arresting my wife for no reason if I were married.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"By ""jackbooted storm troopers,"" do you mean the Pawnee Police Department?",5,19

Extra,"Hi, Leslie.",5,19
Extra,Good Danish today.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"The Pawnee charter is not a ""living document,"" Ms. Knope.",5,19

Garth Blunden,"By that logic, every time I go to bed at night, I am Wolverine.",5,19
Leslie Knope,You bought XMen pajamas?,5,19
Garth Blunden,"I won them, madam, in a raffle.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"The point is is that our Founding Fathers were brilliant and they were courageous, but they also had wooden teeth and pooped in holes in the ground.",5,19
Leslie Knope,It was a more primitive time.,5,19
Garth Blunden,It was a better time.,5,19
Garth Blunden,You wouldn't have survived two weeks in their day.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?",5,19
Leslie Knope,How about a little wager?,5,19
Leslie Knope,"How about you and I go live in that historical house, no modern technology, If you last longer, I withdraw my bill.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"I win, you stop this nonsense.",5,19

Ben Wyatt,I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, honey.",5,19
Ben Wyatt,I love you.,5,19
Ann Perkins,"Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority.",5,19

Ben Wyatt,No.,5,19
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?",5,19
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay.",5,19
Ben Wyatt,I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't.",5,19
Ben Wyatt,"The Lannisters, while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example.",5,19
Ann Perkins,This is why we don't hang out.,5,19
Chris Traeger,Think of yourselves as engineers steering a locomotive of positivity that runs on team power.,5,19
Ron Swanson,"First of all, you don't ""steer"" a locomotive.",5,19
Ron Swanson,The tracks do.,5,19
Ron Swanson,"Second, there are only three ways to motivate people money, fear, and hunger.",5,19
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I disagree.",5,19
Chris Traeger,"What about encouragement, appreciation, and smiles.",5,19
Chris Traeger,"When people feel supported, they will literally explode with productivity.",5,19
April Ludgate,Can you guys just figure out which way is better and tell me so we can leave?,5,19
Chris Traeger,"Thank you for your input, April, but the katumts requires that we follow a very specific syllabus.",5,19
April Ludgate,"You're not being very inclusive, Chris.",5,19
April Ludgate,I feel like my input isn't being appreciated.,5,19
April Ludgate,You've killed my spirit.,5,19
April Ludgate,My spirit blood is on your hands.,5,19

Andy Dwyer,That is really good.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Andy.,5,19
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm sorry.",5,19

Leslie Knope,This is horrifying.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Nobody eat that.,5,19
Leslie Knope,I think I'm in over my head.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Garth really knows his stuff.,5,19
Leslie Knope,He planted an entire field of barley.,5,19
Leslie Knope,How long is he planning on staying here?,5,19
Garth Blunden,"Hey, um, aren't we husband and wife in this scenario?",5,19
Garth Blunden,"I mean, like, shouldn't you",5,19
Leslie Knope,Not a chance.,5,19
Garth Blunden,Okay.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's that?",5,19
Leslie Knope,Do you guys feel that?,5,19
Leslie Knope,Aah!,5,19
Leslie Knope,How long was that under there?,5,19
Tom Haverford,"Man, Garth is a machine.",5,19
Tom Haverford,He brought his own whale blubber to light the lamps.,5,19
Leslie Knope,I thought he was gonna last an hour max.,5,19
Leslie Knope,It's like he's getting stronger the longer he stays here.,5,19
Garth Blunden,Whee!,5,19
Garth Blunden,"Look at my hoop, Leslie.",5,19
Garth Blunden,Look at my hoop!,5,19
Tom Haverford,Ugh!,5,19
Tom Haverford,Who could live like this?,5,19
Leslie Knope,No one.,5,19
Leslie Knope,That's why we've moved on.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"It's fun to be here on, like, a school field trip or something.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"It's so, so, so fun.",5,19
Andy Dwyer,"So, so fun.",5,19
Leslie Knope,But to live like this is insane.,5,19
Leslie Knope,He must have cheated somehow.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's no way a man who's into XMen that much can stay away from the Internet that long.",5,19
Leslie Knope,We should check his phone.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"Goodness, how delicious eating goober peas",5,19

Ron Swanson,Yes.,5,19
Donna Meagle,Cool.,5,19
Tom Haverford,Got it.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now let's not read anything.",5,19
Leslie Knope,That's an invasion of his privacy.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.,5,19
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, he doesn't have any new emails.",5,19
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God.",5,19
Tom Haverford,It's true.,5,19
Tom Haverford,He hasn't gotten an email in 12 days. Is he a ghost?,5,19
Tom Haverford,The only ones he gets are spam.,5,19
Tom Haverford,And he responds to them.,5,19
Tom Haverford,I think I'm gonna be sick.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man.",5,19
Leslie Knope,This guy has no friends.,5,19
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.,5,19
Andy Dwyer,Seems like he's friends with that mule.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,What's that?,5,19
Ann Perkins,"Well, since I can't give her a waffle iron for breakfast day, I am making her a miniature Leslie out of breakfast food.",5,19
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,"Well, listen, I've been thinking.",5,19
Ben Wyatt,How would you feel about going in on the waffle iron together?,5,19
Ann Perkins,Seriously?,5,19
Ann Perkins,"That would be great, but whose holiday are we celebrating?",5,19
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I think I may have a plan that'll get us out of breakfast day and waffle day and all the other days without making us seem like ungrateful people who are annoyed at how amazing Leslie is.",5,19
Ann Perkins,"Dude, whatever it is, I'm in.",5,19
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great.",5,19
Ann Perkins,What should I do with this?,5,19
Ben Wyatt,Just burn it and bury the ashes and pray it doesn't haunt you.,5,19
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, stop filing those red folders at once.",5,19
Ron Swanson,Begin filing these blue ones.,5,19
Jerry Gergich,Oh.,5,19
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, Ron.",5,19
Jerry Gergich,I promised Chris that,5,19
Ron Swanson,This is the top priority.,5,19
Ron Swanson,I need these blue folders done now.,5,19
Ron Swanson,You can eat when you have finished.,5,19
Ron Swanson,File!,5,19

Ron Swanson,"Money, fear, hunger.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there, Garth.",5,19
Leslie Knope,Whatcha whittling?,5,19
Garth Blunden,A birthing stick.,5,19
Leslie Knope,What's that?,5,19
Garth Blunden,You do not want to know.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",5,19
Garth Blunden,You look beautiful.,5,19

Leslie Knope,Yeah.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Garth, I have another proposition.",5,19
Garth Blunden,"Yes, I will go out on a date with you, but I realize you're a modern woman, so I will let you pay.",5,19
Leslie Knope,No.,5,19
Leslie Knope,I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission?,5,19
Garth Blunden,Those clowns? No thank you.,5,19
Garth Blunden,They haven't answered a single one of my complaints about their anachronistic use of fonts in their newsletter.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such.",5,19
Leslie Knope,I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to.,5,19
Garth Blunden,Just sounds like such a big bite out of my soap-making time.,5,19
Garth Blunden,My cousin's arraignment is in May.,5,19
Garth Blunden,But that's a day.,5,19
Garth Blunden,"I just fly out, I come back the same day.",5,19
Garth Blunden,"On a trial basis, yes.",5,19
Garth Blunden,"Yes, yes.",5,19
Leslie Knope,Great.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the team.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Garth dropped his protest, and we were able to get rid of all the outdated laws in the town charter.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the charter is a wonderful document, but we've had the benefit of almost 200 years of learning and advancing.",5,19
Leslie Knope,Seems to me we ought to use it.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"I did not change Article Two, though.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking.",5,19
Leslie Knope,Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"From this year hence, a volunteer will represent Ted in our town's most historic and cherished tradition.",5,19
Leslie Knope,"This year, the honor goes to Mr. Garth Blundin!",5,19
Garth Blunden,"Huzzah, I'm Ted! I'm Ted!",5,19

Chris Traeger,Yes!,5,19
Donna Meagle,And 384 blue files.,5,19
Ron Swanson,Yes.,5,19
Chris Traeger,Wait a minute.,5,19
Chris Traeger,How is that possible?,5,19
Donna Meagle,"Well, he was so happy when you told him he was doing a great job that he spent 20 minutes on the phone telling Gayle about it.",5,19
Ron Swanson,And the prosecution rests.,5,19
Donna Meagle,Not so fast.,5,19
Donna Meagle,"He may have filed more blue ones, but they're almost all filed wrong.",5,19
Donna Meagle,Not surprising since he was a mess after you talked to him.,5,19
Chris Traeger,"Another fascinating edition of ""katumts.""",5,19
Chris Traeger,We may never know conclusively which way works better.,5,19
Chris Traeger,"But I do know this-- When we first started the seminar, I hoped to be able to engage you in the process.",5,19
Chris Traeger,And by that measure I succeeded.,5,19
Ron Swanson,And I predicted that I would learn nothing from this process.,5,19
Ron Swanson,Mission accomplished.,5,19
Chris Traeger,What did April write? Where is April?,5,19
April Ludgate,I will pit Ron and Chris against each other.,5,19
April Ludgate,"They'll argue about dumb stuff that doesn't matter, and I will bail.",5,19
April Ludgate,Then I'll steal $20 from Chris's wallet and buy pizza with Andy.,5,19
April Ludgate,"Oh, and I'll also steal Ron's watch, just for fun.""",5,19
Chris Traeger,I think April will be a fine manager.,5,19

Leslie Knope,Wow.,5,19
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,But Ann and I wanted to tell you that this is the last Breakfast Day and Waffle Day we'll be celebrating.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what? Oh, my God.",5,19
Leslie Knope,You're both dying.,5,19
Ann Perkins,"No, no.",5,19
Ann Perkins,We just can't keep up with all the anniversaries.,5,19
Ann Perkins,"It's too much, especially 'cause you're so good at them.",5,19
Leslie Knope,I'm no better at them than you are.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"That's ridiculous, I'm so much better.",5,19
Leslie Knope,Point taken.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,But we have a compromise.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,"Every year, there will be one day, ""Ann Day,"" where you can celebrate all of Ann's holidays and ""Ben Day"" where we can celebrate all of ours.",5,19
Leslie Knope,What about Ann Month and Ben Month?,5,19
Ann Perkins,How about a week?,5,19
Leslie Knope,Fine.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,"We went in with a day, figuring she'd counter with a month.",5,19
Ann Perkins,We were fine with a week.,5,19
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,5,19
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,5,19
Leslie Knope,But there will be a third week.,5,19
Leslie Knope,It will be called Friend Week.,5,19
Leslie Knope,"It will be commemorating this week, the week that my two best friends became each other's best friends.",5,19
Leslie Knope,I have a Friend Week present for you right now.,5,19

Extra,You have every reason to expect a healthy child.,5,20
Extra,"In fact, if you'd like, you can provide your sample today.",5,20
Ann Perkins,Today?,5,20
Ann Perkins,"Like, today, today?",5,20
Chris Traeger,This today?,5,20
Extra,"Well, yes.",5,20
Extra,"I mean, the timing is right according to Ann's ovulation schedule.",5,20
Extra,Unless there's a reason you'd like to wait till next month.,5,20
Ann Perkins,No.,5,20
Chris Traeger,None.,5,20
Chris Traeger,One other question.,5,20
Chris Traeger,Completely off topic.,5,20
Chris Traeger,Would I be providing this sample today?,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Here I am thinking about how fast my first year in city council has gone, and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past him with nothing to show for it.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"This is everything in his file a handicapped parking sticker from when he got gout, a Parks and Rec golf cart driving exam which he failed, a scathing performance review.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"I mean, why would anyone be so mean?",5,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait.",5,20
Leslie Knope,I wrote this.,5,20
Leslie Knope,I stand by it.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Jerry was never really the type to rise above mediocrity or to it.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"That's what I thought, but when he started, he had a lot of dreams and goals.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at his original entry paperwork.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"He wanted to meet the mayor, have a building named after him.",5,20
Leslie Knope,I just can't let Jerry leave here with nothing and go home to an empty life.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'll help with anything.",5,20
Ben Wyatt,Just promise we'll do it quickly.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,I'm making us a mac and cheese pizza for,5,20
Leslie Knope,Mac and cheese pizza?,5,20
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,5,20
Leslie Knope,You're making that?,5,20
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,5,20
April Ludgate,Torturing Jerry was my favorite thing in the world.,5,20
April Ludgate,After making out with you.,5,20
Andy Dwyer,Remember when we did both at the same time?,5,20
Andy Dwyer,It made him so uncomfortable.,5,20
Tom Haverford,This is a sad day.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Who are we gonna make fun of now?,5,20
Ron Swanson,No need to worry.,5,20
Ron Swanson,"Every place I've ever worked in has had a ""Jerry.""",5,20
Ron Swanson,"When one Jerry leaves, the office naturally selects a new Jerry to fill that role.",5,20
Ron Swanson,It's Social Darwinism.,5,20
Ron Swanson,The strong prey on the weak.,5,20
Ron Swanson,"Soon, one of you will be ridiculed mercilessly.",5,20
Ron Swanson,"Ah, nature.",5,20
Ann Perkins,Okay.,5,20
Ann Perkins,My transfer was approved.,5,20
Ann Perkins,"So starting now, I am an employee of the County Health Board.",5,20
Ann Perkins,"You are no longer my boss, and we can have a baby without being a conflict of interest.",5,20
Ann Perkins,Clear sailing.,5,20
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins, my excellent employee.",5,20
Chris Traeger,"Hello, Ann Perkins, my fallopian princess.",5,20
Extra,So here's the drill.,5,20
Extra,Make a deposit in here.,5,20
Extra,"If you fill it up all the way, you get on the board.",5,20

Chris Traeger,Sounds romantic.,5,20
Chris Traeger,I guess it's go time.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Go time!,5,20
Ann Perkins,"Wait, what am I doing?",5,20
Ann Perkins,I don't go with you.,5,20
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no.",5,20
Chris Traeger,I go in alone with this pornographic disc and do it myself.,5,20
Chris Traeger,And you stay out here and try not to think about what I'm doing in there.,5,20
Chris Traeger,And I try not to think about you waiting out here trying not to think about me.,5,20
Chris Traeger,Should I think about you?,5,20
Chris Traeger,This is so weird.,5,20
Ann Perkins,"Chris, we don't have to do this today.",5,20
Ann Perkins,This was totally just sprung on us.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Let's just take a moment.,5,20
Ann Perkins,There's so many pamphlets to look at.,5,20
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we do have very important pamphlet reading to do.",5,20
Chris Traeger,"Excellent idea, Ann Perkins.",5,20
Chris Traeger,Do I keep this?,5,20
Ann Perkins,I don't know.,5,20
Ann Perkins,It feels wrong to leave it here.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Give it to me.,5,20
Ann Perkins,I panicked.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Run!,5,20
Tom Haverford,Here are the last of the Animal Control reports.,5,20
April Ludgate,"What are you doing, weirdo?",5,20
Tom Haverford,Just trying not to spill anything.,5,20
Ron Swanson,I believe Leslie said to organize these by year.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Way ahead of you.,5,20
Tom Haverford,I made two pile files.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Pilo fibles.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Ugh.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Filo pilos.,5,20
Andy Dwyer,Filo pilos?,5,20
Andy Dwyer,That's not right.,5,20
Donna Meagle,Are you broken?,5,20
Tom Haverford,"No, everything's fine.",5,20
April Ludgate,"Well, I guess that settles who the new Jerry is.",5,20
Tom Haverford,"No, it doesn't!",5,20
Tom Haverford,I barely even said it wrong.,5,20
Andy Dwyer,Said it wrong.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Stop it!,5,20
Tom Haverford,This is how it begins.,5,20
Tom Haverford,"The next ""Jerry.""",5,20
Tom Haverford,"One screwed-up sentence, and 30 years later, I'm wearing aquamarine sweater vests and listening to Bonnie Raitt and The da Vinci Code on my iPod.",5,20
Tom Haverford,It's already started.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Believe it or not, Jerry, you were young once.",5,20
Leslie Knope,Young and full of dreams.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,I forgot I wrote all this.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"And as unrealistic and absurd as those goals were, we are not letting you retire until we help you achieve them.",5,20
Leslie Knope,So let's see what's first.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"""Eat in city council private dining room.""",5,20
Leslie Knope,That we can achieve.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Right now?,5,20
Leslie Knope,Sure.,5,20
Leslie Knope,Let's go.,5,20

Leslie Knope,"Oh, they're with me.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"City Councilor Leslie Knope, clearance level four.",5,20
Extra,Guests are only allowed on Wednesdays.,5,20
Extra,And we don't have clearance levels.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"I know, but shouldn't we?",5,20
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it sounds so cool.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we just need to get in there real quick and maybe take a picture.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"He's retiring as a city hall employee after 41 years, and it was his dream to eat here.",5,20
Extra,His dream?,5,20
Extra,Really?,5,20

Jerry Gergich,"It's okay, Leslie.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,Come on.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,But thank you.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Thank you for trying.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no.",5,20
Leslie Knope,I promised you an executive meal and you're gonna get one.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Ben, just okay.",5,20
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go in there and take a picture with Jerry.,5,20
Leslie Knope,I put my arm around nothing.,5,20

Tom Haverford,And it's not me.,5,20
Tom Haverford,It's Andy.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Big guy?,5,20
Tom Haverford,Check.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Goofy?,5,20

Donna Meagle,"Barking up the wrong tree, Filo.",5,20
Tom Haverford,What do you mean?,5,20
Donna Meagle,Andy will never be the new Jerry.,5,20
Donna Meagle,Nothing embarrasses him.,5,20
Donna Meagle,He's like a giant puppy with no shame.,5,20
Donna Meagle,What you need is some fresh meat in the office.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Or you guys could just stop making fun of me.,5,20
Donna Meagle,Yeah.,5,20
Donna Meagle,No.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, on to the next Jerry goal meet Mayor Knudson.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,He was the mayor at the time.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,I've always wanted to meet him.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,"Well, today you're getting that chance.",5,20
Ben Wyatt,So was he like a really great mayor?,5,20
Leslie Knope,"No, not really.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"He resigned because of corruption and racketeering, and then he died from an overdose of pills.",5,20
Leslie Knope,But actually his real cause of death was being thrown out of a helicopter while handcuffed.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Some people say he's still alive because they never found the body, but they never found the body because he exploded on impact.",5,20
Ben Wyatt,Sounds like a good dude.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,"I just wish I had a chance to meet him, you know, years ago before all the scandals and his death.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,But this is nice too.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,Is it?,5,20
Leslie Knope,Yes.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.,5,20
Leslie Knope,It is.,5,20

Jerry Gergich,You deserve better.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you tried, but I took a day off to spend with you, not with you and Jerry and a dead mayor.",5,20
Ben Wyatt,Can we please just call it a day?,5,20
Leslie Knope,"No, we can't because in a few short years, we're gonna be visiting Jerry here, and he will have achieved nothing.",5,20
Leslie Knope,Is that what you want?,5,20
Ben Wyatt,No.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,It's really been nice to meet you.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, let's go.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Ronfire of the vanities.,5,20
Ron Swanson,Filo Pilo.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding me?,5,20
Tom Haverford,"Listen, now that Jerry's gone, we need to hire someone to pick up the slack.",5,20
Ron Swanson,A new person in the office?,5,20
Tom Haverford,Not a person.,5,20
Tom Haverford,An intern.,5,20
Ron Swanson,Why on earth would I get an intern?,5,20
Tom Haverford,Interns cost nothing to the taxpayer.,5,20
Tom Haverford,"And more importantly, they're usually stupid and terrible.",5,20
Tom Haverford,So they get no work done.,5,20
Tom Haverford,It's like a Jerry you don't have to pay.,5,20
Ron Swanson,"Damn, son.",5,20
Ron Swanson,That is one compelling argument.,5,20
Ron Swanson,"Keep it up, Filo.",5,20
Ron Swanson,We may destroy this government one day after all.,5,20
Chris Traeger,These pamphlets are fascinating.,5,20
Chris Traeger,"It says here that some men gain ""sympathy weight"" when their partners get pregnant.",5,20
Chris Traeger,"If that happens to me, I'd be miserable.",5,20
Chris Traeger,But happy.,5,20
Chris Traeger,But sad.,5,20
Ann Perkins,I would have never imagined the babymaking process to be this clinical.,5,20
Ann Perkins,"I mean, imagine if actual sex were like this.",5,20
Chris Traeger,Let me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our genes.,5,20
Chris Traeger,And it's also weird because we dated and we remember what it's like to engage in some of those physical activities.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Exactly.,5,20
Ann Perkins,And we were also pretty good at those physical activities.,5,20
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were.",5,20
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were.",5,20
Ann Perkins,"You know, is this all the pamphlets?",5,20
Ann Perkins,'Cause I think that maybe I have some left in my bedroom.,5,20
Chris Traeger,"Oh, well, then, we should definitely go look for those.",5,20
Ann Perkins,Let's find those.,5,20
Chris Traeger,We need to find those.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Hurry.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone gather around.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I really appreciate this, but I did promise Gayle I would leave by 5:00.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"She has a tasty surprise waiting for me, if you know what I mean.",5,20
April Ludgate,"Gross, Jerry.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,She made a meatloaf.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is better than meatloaf.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"When Jerry first applied for this job, one of this goals was to have a building named after him.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"Again, that is an absurd request considering your work record.",5,20
Leslie Knope,But I thought maybe he could have a room named after him.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"So henceforth, Parks and Rec conference room will serve as a testament to your years of public service.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God.",5,20
Andy Dwyer,"Hear, hear.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"""Jerry Gergich Memorial Conference Room. R.I.P.""?",5,20
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, the guy at the plaque store thought you had died.",5,20
Ben Wyatt,"It was a rush job, so we didn't have time to change it.",5,20
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.,5,20
Leslie Knope,We can just pretend it means retire in peace.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay.",5,20
Leslie Knope,So bring out the cake!,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Oh.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Speech, speech, speech.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"Well, thank you, guys.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"I'm not much of a speechmaker, but I do like good cake.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,Delicious.,5,20
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you're on fire.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,Oh!,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry!",5,20
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that went roughly as well as I thought it would.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,I promised Gayle I'd leave at 5:00.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,I guess this is it.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Bye.,5,20
Andy Dwyer,"See you tomorrow, Jeremy.",5,20
Tom Haverford,"Well, pretty heroic, huh, guys?",5,20
Tom Haverford,Hard to make fun of that.,5,20
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, the cake.",5,20
Andy Dwyer,Filo Pilo ruined the cake.,5,20
April Ludgate,Classic Pilo.,5,20
Tom Haverford,What how is that my fault?,5,20
Tom Haverford,Stupid Jerry.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Should have never saved his life.,5,20

Gayle Gergich,Is that Leslie Knope?,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Yes.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi, Gayle.",5,20
Gayle Gergich,What a surprise.,5,20
Gayle Gergich,I insist you join us for breakfast.,5,20
Gayle Gergich,This guy is the greatest breakfast chef in the world.,5,20

Jerry Gergich,Your purse is shaped like a waffle.,5,20
Leslie Knope,Is it?,5,20
Gayle Gergich,Please join us.,5,20

April Ludgate,"Yeah, he went to high school with my sister, Natalie.",5,20
April Ludgate,He was a big deal on the football team.,5,20
Tom Haverford,"Oh, meathead jock type, huh?",5,20
Extra,"Actually, I quit football senior year so I could help my pastor run a homeless shelter.",5,20
Tom Haverford,Oh.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Pfftt!,5,20
Tom Haverford,"This guy loves the homeless so much, he should marry them, right?",5,20
Andy Dwyer,Anybody would be lucky to marry him.,5,20
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Taylor, do you want to marry me and April?",5,20
Extra,"Wish I could, man, but I'm not a ""marriage"" dude.",5,20
Extra,"I've got a lot of love to give, and it just seems unfair to put boundaries on it.",5,20

Donna Meagle,You so get it.,5,20
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey.",5,20
Chris Traeger,Hi.,5,20
Chris Traeger,Should I keep walking towards you?,5,20
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I could stop, and you could walk.",5,20

Ann Perkins,Hello.,5,20
Chris Traeger,Hi.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Welp.,5,20
Chris Traeger,Okay.,5,20

Tom Haverford,I'm a business owner.,5,20
Tom Haverford,I wear dope suits.,5,20
Tom Haverford,I have fur underwear.,5,20
Tom Haverford,It was all for nothing.,5,20
Tom Haverford,I'm back to being a Jerry.,5,20
Tom Haverford,All right.,5,20
Tom Haverford,I gotta buy some sweat pants and a Nicholas Sparks novel.,5,20
Tom Haverford,Might as well lean into it.,5,20
Ron Swanson,Tom can take care of himself.,5,20
Ron Swanson,He's a grown man.,5,20
Ron Swanson,"Well, half grown.",5,20
Ron Swanson,He does have a business where he rents out his clothes to 12 year olds.,5,20

Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted your last day at work to be special, and I feel like I let you down.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,No!,5,20
Leslie Knope,So I made you this scrapbook with nearly 4 amazing pages jam-packed with memories of your time in the government.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my god well, look.",5,20
Gayle Gergich,"Oh, honey.",5,20
Gayle Gergich,You look great in every one of these.,5,20

Leslie Knope,Okay.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,"No! You also dropped that, clumsy.",5,20
Leslie Knope,Where am I?,5,20
Jerry Gergich,"I know I didn't achieve all my work goals, but, Leslie, I don't care because for me, the best part about working in the Parks department was that I got to be home every night with my family at 5:00.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,"And to me, that's what mattered most.",5,20
Jerry Gergich,Little Sebastian,5,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow.",5,20

Jerry Gergich,The hug machine is here.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,The hug machine-- it's firing on all cylinders.,5,20
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I think we should be adults and talk about this.",5,20
Chris Traeger,I would love to.,5,20
Ann Perkins,I was nervous after yesterday because I was thinking what does this mean for us?,5,20
Ann Perkins,"Not as parents, but as Chris and Ann? I don't think on-again, off-again is a great parental model.",5,20
Chris Traeger,"Well, I completely agree.",5,20
Ann Perkins,"But if there is a hypothetical chance that we could provide a home with two parents who are hypothetically together, then that could be even better hypothetically.",5,20
Chris Traeger,Of course.,5,20
Chris Traeger,We should discuss and consider all the possibilities.,5,20
Chris Traeger,The most important thing for me and I think for you is that we have a child.,5,20
Chris Traeger,And I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.,5,20
Ann Perkins,Do you want to make out?,5,20
Chris Traeger,I really do.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,Hey.,5,20
April Ludgate,"What are you doing here, Jerry? I thought you were fired.",5,20

Andy Dwyer,That's what they all say.,5,20
Ron Swanson,I asked Jerry to come in.,5,20
Ron Swanson,"That new intern wasn't working out, so I got rid of him.",5,20
Donna Meagle,"Once again, I object in the strongest possible terms.",5,20
Ron Swanson,"Once again, noted.",5,20
Ron Swanson,I have also asked Jerry to come in a couple hours a week until we find a permanent replacement.,5,20
April Ludgate,"Ugh, just when we were rid of him?",5,20
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I don't know, Ron.",5,20
Ron Swanson,"Are you hearing me, son? Jerry will come in once a week, and everyone will get to watch him eat and talk to him about anything he might do or say or fart.",5,20

Jerry Gergich,Thank you.,5,20
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, it feels good just to be",5,20
Andy Dwyer,Classic new guy.,5,20
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry that I spent your day off with Jerry instead of relaxing with you.,5,20

Ben Wyatt,"And after you fell asleep making Jerry's scrapbook, I went back to season one of Fringe to check for plot holes.",5,20
Ben Wyatt,"As I suspected, airtight.",5,20
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,5,20
Leslie Knope,This is all my fault.,5,20
Leslie Knope,I love my job.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"But in the blink of an eye, I'm gonna be retiring, you know, and flying off on Marine One with you and a Secret Service detail.",5,20
Leslie Knope,"Achievements are great, but I want more than that.",5,20
Leslie Knope,I want what Jerry has.,5,20
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're always gonna work, but I think we need to fill this scrapbook too.",5,20
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should take a real day off and talk about starting our family.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,That sounds perfect.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, while you were over at Jerry's, did you happen to get any information about his history with Gayle?",5,20

Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a mystery, Ben.",5,20
Leslie Knope,Let it go.,5,20
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I can't.",5,20

Leslie Knope,Hey!,5,21
Leslie Knope,What the hell is this?,5,21
Ron Swanson,I'm guessing it's my latest budget cut proposal based on your rage sweat.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I am rage glowing.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"Second, you wanna cut funding for the Pawnee Palms Public PuttPutt?",5,21
Leslie Knope,What did the P.P.P.P.P. ever do to you?,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Ron is very antigovernment, and he has that philosophy, but there are just certain things that you don't cut.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"Schools, police, minigolf, merrygorounds, parades, gazebo repair, roads and bridges, whatever.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"Pretty gardens, hummingbird feeders.",5,21
Ron Swanson,I believe in cutting useless government projects.,5,21
Ron Swanson,"I also believe in cutting useful projects, future projects, and past projects.",5,21
Ron Swanson,The Hoover Dam is a travesty.,5,21
Leslie Knope,You also believe in making furniture.,5,21
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go solder a chair instead?,5,21
Ron Swanson,Do you expect me to make a chair out of transistor chips and small wires?,5,21
Ron Swanson,"Look, the defunding of the minigolf course is on the agenda for the city council meeting tomorrow.",5,21
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll argue against it with your trademark vigor.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I will argue, and I'm gonna win.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"That puttputt is gonna be around forever, and when I am done with it, it'll attract more visitors than the Hoover Dam.",5,21
Leslie Knope,And it'll produce double the amount of electricity.,5,21
Ron Swanson,How?,5,21
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out.,5,21
Leslie Knope,It already has windmills.,5,21
Leslie Knope,Who cares?,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Councilmen, I have something to discuss with you, but before I do, can I just point out how handsome the both of you look today?",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I know.",5,21
Councilman Milton,I feel very ill.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, tomorrow we are voting on funding for the minigolf course, and personally, I think it is great for families, it's a great job creator, and it's extremely cute.",5,21
Leslie Knope,I'm wondering which way you two are leaning.,5,21
Councilman Milton,"Well, the last time I was there, I saw kids of all races getting along and playing.",5,21
Councilman Milton,It was terrible.,5,21
Councilman Milton,So I'm voting to get rid of it.,5,21
Leslie Knope,At least you have a good reason.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Well, Howser is with me.",5,21
Leslie Knope,Milton is with Dexhart.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Jeremy, you're the swing vote.",5,21
Leslie Knope,What do you think?,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, on the one hand, I love cutting government programs.",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,"On the other hand, minigolf rules.",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,"And on the third hand, I hate both you and Ron Swanson.",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,So this one could go either way.,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,I'm kind of a badass wild card.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,More like who am I doing?,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,No one.,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,I'm free.,5,21

Ben Wyatt,I am?,5,21
Ben Wyatt,You drove here.,5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Nah, it's too late, bro.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,I already ordered the water.,5,21
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what you want me to do.,5,21
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I just closed a big donation to the Redwood Music Program, a charity he discovered, so I suggested we all go out for a celebratory drink.",5,21
Ben Wyatt,And somehow I just ended up becoming the designated driver.,5,21
Ben Wyatt,And paying for everyone.,5,21
Ben Wyatt,And I didn't get to choose the bar.,5,21
Ben Wyatt,I should be more assertive.,5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, the band is moving me tonight.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,It's really good.,5,21
Ben Wyatt,Really?,5,21
Ben Wyatt,They sound kinda crappy to me.,5,21
April Ludgate,"Kinda sounds like one of your songs, babe.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you know what, Mouse Rat has a lot of influence on some of the local high school bands, mostly 'cause Chang buys 'em beer and whatnot.",5,21
April Ludgate,"Wait, Andy, this is a Mouse Rat song.",5,21
Burly,"Spread your wings and fly, yeah",5,21

Tom Haverford,I already lent you my car.,5,21
Tom Haverford,Do you not know where my car is?,5,21
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ugh, I'm so sick of the third degree.",5,21
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's like dating a cop.,5,21
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm gassy.,5,21
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Let's make out.,5,21
Tom Haverford,What?,5,21
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Yeah.,5,21
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Move aside!,5,21
Tom Haverford,Dating MonaLisa is awesome.,5,21
Tom Haverford,Except that I live in constant fear for my life.,5,21
Tom Haverford,So I guess it's time to do the mature thing and have someone else dump her for me.,5,21
Tom Haverford,"Uh, Perkins, sit down.",5,21
Tom Haverford,I just heard that you and Traeger might be getting back together.,5,21
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's funny, right?",5,21

Ann Perkins,You said that about me.,5,21
Tom Haverford,"Calm down, Ann.",5,21
Tom Haverford,You're proving my point.,5,21
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, MonaLisa is legit insane.",5,21
Tom Haverford,She once jumped out of a moving car to buy a Nicki Minaj poster.,5,21
Tom Haverford,Can you break up with her for me?,5,21
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna dump a girl for you.,5,21
Tom Haverford,I'll give you that chenille blanket of mine you love so much.,5,21
Ann Perkins,Deal.,5,21
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, but that's my favorite blankie.",5,21

Andy Dwyer,What's up?,5,21
Burly,"First of all, your nachos are terrible.",5,21
Burly,No one's had the guts to tell you.,5,21
Burly,Why don't you melt the cheese?,5,21
Chang,"We tried to tell you about the show, man.",5,21
Chang,"I called your cell, like, 20 times.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I dropped my cell phone in a bowl of cereal last week, you idiot.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,"You bothered to call me, you'd have known that.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you should change your name to Burly and The Backstabbers.,5,21
Burly,"That's a pretty good name, actually.",5,21

Jeremy Jamm,Get me a Budweiser Black Crown.,5,21

Jeremy Jamm,"If not, you should.",5,21
Chris Traeger,"Ron, are you gonna be joining us?",5,21

Leslie Knope,Your office shall serve as its monkey tomb.,5,21
Ron Swanson,How much did you pay for this?,5,21
Leslie Knope,Irrelevant.,5,21
Leslie Knope,I would pay any amount of money to properly shame you.,5,21
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you should know by now that I live my life according to a certain set of principles, and I do not deviate from them.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"Right, I mean, God forbid you're flexible in any way.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"You should just stick to your stupid, rigid, antigovernment principles.",5,21
Leslie Knope,But you know what?,5,21
Leslie Knope,Those principles stink.,5,21
Leslie Knope,They're not the right principles.,5,21
Ron Swanson,You may think so.,5,21
Ron Swanson,I do not.,5,21
Ron Swanson,Thank you for my new silver-backed friend.,5,21

Tom Haverford,"Well, Mona-Lisa and the random girl she grabbed after you left got into a fistfight in the parking lot.",5,21
Tom Haverford,"Eventually, Mona-Lisa threw a cinderblock through the girl's windshield.",5,21
Tom Haverford,"She dives in, steals her purse, doesn't go for the money, steals all her birth control pills, and says, ""Bitch, you're gonna get pregnant.""",5,21
Tom Haverford,She then pretends those are ecstasy and sells it to a bunch of college kids that are drinking Goldschlager at a gas station.,5,21
Ann Perkins,You have to break up with her.,5,21
Tom Haverford,I tried.,5,21
Tom Haverford,Again.,5,21

Tom Haverford,Never use a lint roller.,5,21
Tom Haverford,I'm dead serious.,5,21
Ann Perkins,Okay.,5,21
Tom Haverford,And keep it out of direct sunlight.,5,21

Jeremy Jamm,My word is garbage.,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,Everyone knows that.,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,Let's talk deal.,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,What can you offer me to change my mind?,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Jamm, even for you, this is pretty sleazy.",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, don't act so shocked.",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,"A few months ago, you traded me your office for that stupid swimming pool bill.",5,21
Jeremy Jamm,Last night you bring in a teenage girl to pump me full of snow cones.,5,21
Jeremy Jamm,This is simply how people like us operate.,5,21
Leslie Knope,I have six things to say to you.,5,21
Leslie Knope,One: You drive me nuts with your rigid code of honor.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Two: Congratulations, putt-putt has been defunded.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"And only because Jamm was going to double-cross you, and I made him stick to his word.",5,21
Leslie Knope,Three: I am furious that putt-putt has been defunded.,5,21
Leslie Knope,Four: I am sorry that I said the gorilla's blood was on your hands.,5,21
Leslie Knope,'Twas Leslie killed the beast.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Five: Putt-putt is for children, and they are the future, and I have already written a ballot measure that will save it, and it will pass.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"And six: Your rigid code of honor, which drives me nuts, makes you a wonderful human being, and I am proud to call you my friend, and don't ever change.",5,21
Ron Swanson,You want a drink?,5,21
Leslie Knope,Very much.,5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Burly, I just want to say I'm sorry that I haven't been to rehearsal and that I won't let you sing or write songs or walk out onstage in front of me.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Man, I love playing with you guys.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,And I want back in if you'll let me.,5,21
Burly,"Well, we never wanted to kick you out.",5,21
Burly,"It's just, you didn't show up for practice, and we like to play.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,Right.,5,21
Burly,"If you wanna come back in, you can.",5,21
Burly,I'm more of a backup singer anyways.,5,21
April Ludgate,You can say that again.,5,21
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you got a great voice.",5,21
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Ben! God, don't say that.",5,21
Burly,"Welcome back, buddy.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,#NAME?,5,21
Andy Dwyer,"All right! Hey, I'll even try melting the cheese on the nachos.",5,21
Burly,All right.,5,21
Andy Dwyer,It won't work.,5,21
Andy Dwyer,You're gonna look like such an idiot.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"I have been in the city council for almost a year, and I'm proud of what I've done.",5,21
Leslie Knope,"But every once in a while, I end up in a situation that makes my stomach queasy.",5,21
Ron Swanson,You're in politics.,5,21
Ron Swanson,What did you expect?,5,21
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I hoped it would be like dealing with you.",5,21
Leslie Knope,People with strong opinions hashing it out respectfully.,5,21
Leslie Knope,And then you either realize that I'm right or you get hungry and go home and I win.,5,21
Ron Swanson,There are a lot of Jeremy Jamms along the path you're walking.,5,21
Ron Swanson,I suppose you just need to figure out whether it's a path you truly wanna walk.,5,21
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,5,21
Leslie Knope,I'm taking that gorilla with me and putting it back in the putt-putt - when it reopens.,5,21
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, no.",5,21
Ron Swanson,That gorilla was a gift from a very determined co-worker whom I respect.,5,21
Ron Swanson,And there's a certain code of honor that accompanies gift-giving.,5,21
Leslie Knope,"God, you're the worst.",5,21
Andy Dwyer,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mouse Rat's Reunion Show, featuring me, Andy Dwyer, and for the first time, Andrew ""Burly"" Burlinson on lead vocals.",5,21

Ron Swanson,Lending?,5,22
Ron Swanson,Makes it sound like I had a choice in the matter.,5,22
Ron Swanson,I never should've agreed to this or let you know that I have a cabin or gotten to know any of you.,5,22
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.,5,22

Andy Dwyer,"So if my science is correct, one of the five women who were at the cabin Leslie, Donna, Ann, MonaLisa, or April is pregnant!",5,22
Andy Dwyer,Can't be April.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,She would've told me.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,That leaves four suspects.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"There's only one man for this job: Bert Macklin, FBI.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,They said I was retired.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,They said I was too dangerous for the Pawnee Police Department.,5,22

Kathryn Pinewood,"Kathryn Pinewood, Pawnee Restaurant Association.",5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,This town is not better off.,5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,"This past year has been a disaster, and this government is hellbent on stripping away our most basic personal freedoms.",5,22
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, counterpoint.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, I've never stripped away anyone's freedoms.",5,22
Leslie Knope,I simply stopped a restaurant from serving an insane which only made our citizens healthier.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"And frankly, I don't see any of those citizens standing up and complaining about",5,22
Leslie Knope,Okay.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Now, I see them.",5,22

Tom Haverford,"I could add some old people stuff, call it ""RentASag.""",5,22
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, no.",5,22
Tom Haverford,Old people are gross.,5,22

Trevor Nelson,He'd like to know if you are looking to sell a controlling interest in the store.,5,22
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, Diddy wants to buy RentASwag?",5,22
Trevor Nelson,Not what I said.,5,22
Tom Haverford,This is a lot to process.,5,22
Tom Haverford,Will Diddy be coming to the meeting?,5,22
Trevor Nelson,I'm not at liberty to tell you who my client is.,5,22
Trevor Nelson,It would violate confidentiality.,5,22
Tom Haverford,I understand.,5,22
Trevor Nelson,It's not Diddy.,5,22
Tom Haverford,Got it.,5,22
Ann Perkins,Oh.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hello Ann.",5,22

Ann Perkins,"What do you want, Macklin?",5,22
Andy Dwyer,Me?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Just observing.,5,22

Andy Dwyer,"Wait, there is just one more question.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,Congratulations.,5,22
Ann Perkins,Is that a question?,5,22

Andy Dwyer,You're pregnant.,5,22
Ann Perkins,What?,5,22
Ann Perkins,I'm not pregnant.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,You're not?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Who is?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,'Cause I found this at Ron Swanson's cabin.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,It's a pregnancy test.,5,22
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God.",5,22
Ann Perkins,Someone we know is pregnant?,5,22
Ann Perkins,I'm trying to get pregnant.,5,22
Ann Perkins,That's not fair.,5,22
Ann Perkins,"I mean, great, and happy for them, and congratulations, whatever, but ooh!",5,22
Ann Perkins,No!,5,22
Ann Perkins,Boo!,5,22
Ann Perkins,We have to find out who this is.,5,22

Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin works alone.,5,22
Ann Perkins,I will buy lunch.,5,22
Ann Perkins,You can have as many burgers as you want.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Welcome to the FBI.,5,22
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Pinewood, Leslie's public health initiative has been a huge success.",5,22
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee is no longer the fourth most obese city in America.,5,22

Chris Traeger,"Together, as a town, we lost an amount of weight equal to 800 pregnant manatees.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"A gym opened, and it stayed in business.",5,22
Leslie Knope,And people checking into the E.R. after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.,5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,But where will it end?,5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,"Now, you wanna rob our children of fun by attacking the Sweetums school lunch program, literally taking candy from babies.",5,22
Leslie Knope,Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.,5,22
Leslie Knope,You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.,5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,They're made from plants.,5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,Stop restricting our freedoms.,5,22
Extra,Yeah!,5,22
Dewey,My name is Dewey from Sanitation.,5,22
Dewey,"Ever since you stripped us of our freedoms by making us hire women, we've had to turn one of our bathrooms into a woman's bathroom.",5,22
Dewey,We only have one bathroom now.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Dewey.",5,22
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a horrible price to pay for something as trivial as gender equality.,5,22
Dewey,So you agree.,5,22
Bjorn Lerpiss,Bjorn Lerpiss of the Pawnee Lerpiss family.,5,22
Bjorn Lerpiss,There was supposed to be a Paunch Burger in this lot next to my house.,5,22
Bjorn Lerpiss,"And then, you stripped my freedom by putting a park there.",5,22
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Now, if I wanna start my day off with a tripledecker pancake breakfast pizza, I gotta go to the one that's 10 minutes away, and that makes me 20 minutes late to work every day.",5,22
Bjorn Lerpiss,I work at home.,5,22
Chris Traeger,Have you ever considered not eating that for breakfast?,5,22
Bjorn Lerpiss,I'll never consider that.,5,22
Leslie Knope,This feels strangely personal.,5,22
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's because they're all standing up saying how much they hate me as a person.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"How many people am I talking to, Donna?",5,22
Andy Dwyer,One or 1 1/9?,5,22
Donna Meagle,Are you asking me if I'm pregnant?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Oh.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Interesting.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember saying anything about anyone being pregnant.,5,22
Ann Perkins,Are you sure it's not you?,5,22
Donna Meagle,I'm a grown woman with a good head on her shoulders.,5,22
Donna Meagle,Don't worry about me.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Whew.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,This case just got interesting.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Well, not just.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,It was pretty interesting to begin with.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,This case just remained interesting.,5,22
Marshall Langman,"Listen, my wife and I do not feel that we're better off than a year ago because a year ago, this town was not a horrifying sex den where people could put their body parts anywhere they want with impunity.",5,22
Marcia Langman,"And then, you were elected.",5,22
Marcia Langman,"And now, this town a horrifying sex den where people can put their body parts anywhere they want to with impunity.",5,22
Marshall Langman,Yeah.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"If you are referring to my fight to teach comprehensive sex education, you need to at least acknowledge the fact that STDs are down 14% from last year.",5,22
Marshall Langman,And deviant behavior in Pawnee is up a billion percent!,5,22
Leslie Knope,"No, it's no, it's",5,22
Marshall Langman,"This town is going to hell in a Gucci knockoff handbag, girl.",5,22
Marshall Langman,See?,5,22
Marshall Langman,See?,5,22
Marshall Langman,They agree.,5,22
Dennis Lerpiss,Come on.,5,22
Dennis Lerpiss,"I am definitely better off than I was a year ago, and it's all thanks to Leslie Knope.",5,22
Dennis Lerpiss,This woman singlehandedly saved my business.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"There you go, perfect example.",5,22
Leslie Knope,No need for further questions on that one.,5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, I'm sorry.",5,22
Kathryn Pinewood,"What is your business, sir?",5,22
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, I run a pornographic DVD emporium.",5,22

Herman,"Oh, it's much better now.",5,22
Extra,Yeah!,5,22
Brandi Maxxxx,Leslie is the best.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"No, no, Brandi.",5,22

Brandi Maxxxx,I'm Brandi Maxxxx,5,22
Extra,"Hi, Brandi.",5,22
Brandi Maxxxx,"Star of such films as the incredible Burt Wonderbone, A Good Guy to Lay Hard, and Argo.",5,22
Brandi Maxxxx,I had a small part in Argo as well as the porn version Our Goo.,5,22
Dennis Lerpiss,I've seen the first 90 seconds.,5,22
Dennis Lerpiss,It's thrilling.,5,22
Brandi Maxxxx,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, there would be far, far less pornography in this town.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"No, what happened was there was a misunderstanding, and I accidentally got the government involved in an unseemly business, but I cleared that up, and everything's fine.",5,22
Leslie Knope,It's not like I'm some kind of sex crazed maniac or something.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, are you pregnant?",5,22
Andy Dwyer,Did you or did you not leave this positive pregnancy test in a dumpster in the woods?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, everybody.",5,22
Leslie Knope,No.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Really?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Okay.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll get out of your hair.",5,22

Andy Dwyer,Was that Brandi Maxxxx?,5,22
Tom Haverford,"Investors, I have some very exciting news about RentASwag.",5,22
Tom Haverford,"Someone I'm not saying Diddy, but I'm not not saying Diddy has offered to buy out RentASwag for a buttload of money.",5,22
Ron Swanson,"How big a buttload, son?",5,22
Tom Haverford,We would all basically double our investments.,5,22
Donna Meagle,Are you kidding me?,5,22
Donna Meagle,"Sell, baby.",5,22
Donna Meagle,Imagine the kind of treat yourself day we could have with the profits.,5,22
Donna Meagle,I'm talking pedicures on pedicures on pedicures.,5,22
Tom Haverford,That is appealing.,5,22
Ron Swanson,"If someone is interested in buying you out, it means you're doing something right.",5,22
Ron Swanson,"I say you continue to grow, accumulate power, find this investor, and buy his business to teach him a lesson.",5,22
Tom Haverford,"April, what do you think?",5,22
April Ludgate,I thought about this a lot.,5,22
April Ludgate,"I actually think that you should get a ""Hello Kitty"" tattoo.",5,22
Tom Haverford,"No, with the store.",5,22
April Ludgate,Oh.,5,22
April Ludgate,"Uh, burn it for the insurance money.",5,22

Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the more you actually accomplish, the more heat you're gonna draw.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know.",5,22
Ben Wyatt,Let's go watch the parade.,5,22
Ben Wyatt,You know you can't resist a parade.,5,22
Leslie Knope,That's true.,5,22

Andy Dwyer,April?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"No, she would've told me.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Besides, the math doesn't add up because we only have sex every single day.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"And since she's the only one that we haven't talked to, it has to be hers.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God.",5,22
Ben Wyatt,I don't like seeing you like this.,5,22
Leslie Knope,I've never felt this way before.,5,22
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just quit.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should both quit, and we should move to the Bahamas, live on a beach, catch fish with homemade spears.",5,22
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you'd last about 30 seconds with that work.",5,22
Ben Wyatt,"When we went to Hawaii, you woke me up at 3:00 A.M. to watch Meet the Press.",5,22

Leslie Knope,"Like, I'm not going to watch that live?",5,22
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you can hate your job sometimes.",5,22
Ben Wyatt,It's allowed.,5,22

Leslie Knope,Yes.,5,22
Ben Wyatt,Do you stand behind everything you've done?,5,22
Leslie Knope,Yes.,5,22
Ben Wyatt,Then screw 'em.,5,22

Leslie Knope,My response to them is this: Bring it on.,5,22
Leslie Knope,Step up.,5,22

Leslie Knope,Stomp the Yard.,5,22
Leslie Knope,There's one.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Look, I work very hard for this town, as hard as I can, and all that matters to me is whether or not everyone here thinks that they are better off now than they were a year ago.",5,22
Leslie Knope,I think you are.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"If you disagree with me, then go ahead and recall me.",5,22
Leslie Knope,Go crazy.,5,22
Leslie Knope,You Got Served.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Silver Linings Playbook, kind of.",5,22
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The committee says they plan to push for a recall vote within two months.,5,22
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Do you have a comment on that?,5,22
Leslie Knope,Nope.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Again, all I really care about is are you better off?",5,22
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I think I'm better off.,5,22

Leslie Knope,"Well, I wasn't asking you specifically, but I'm happy to hear that, Shauna.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't end my big press conference by saying ""Recall, shmecall.""",5,22
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Ben, can you help me out here?",5,22
Ben Wyatt,That concludes councilwoman Knope's press conference.,5,22
Ben Wyatt,"And if you have any further questions hold on to them, because she has a lot of work to do.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, honey.",5,22
Leslie Knope,Honey.,5,22
Leslie Knope,That's another dance movie with Jessica alba.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Alright, people.",5,22
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee river's not gonna clean itself.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Volunteer weekend task force, mobilize.",5,22
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Leslie, this goes without saying, but if you need any speeches or testimonials or just general enthusiasm for your recall fight, I'm your man.",5,22
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris.",5,22
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.,5,22
Chris Traeger,I'll see you at the river.,5,22
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh!",5,22
Chris Traeger,Last one to pick up has still accomplished a great deal.,5,22
Ann Perkins,"Hey, maybe after, you wanna come meet me and Chris for a drink?",5,22
Leslie Knope,Sure.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going with you guys?",5,22
Ann Perkins,"We're great, actually, and we're having a good time.",5,22
Ann Perkins,Sex is ridiculous.,5,22
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.,5,22
Ann Perkins,"Hopefully, that ridiculous sex will lead to a baby.",5,22
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy for you.,5,22
Leslie Knope,Just remember to use protection.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, don't.",5,22
Leslie Knope,That would defeat the purpose.,5,22
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no.",5,22
Leslie Knope,Do your thing.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Yeah! My wife is pregnant!,5,22
April Ludgate,"Okay, put me down.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you can't keep it from me.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"I found the pregnancy test, honey.",5,22
April Ludgate,"Honey, I'm not pregnant, okay? And if I were, you shouldn't lift me up.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, are you sure you're not?",5,22
April Ludgate,Yeah.,5,22
April Ludgate,We've talked about this.,5,22
April Ludgate,Remember? I wanna wait until we're 50 and then adopt a set of creepy adult twins from Romania.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,Of course.,5,22
April Ludgate,"Actually, there is something I need to tell you.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,You're pregnant.,5,22
April Ludgate,No.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,No! We just ruled that out.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, dang it.",5,22
April Ludgate,"Okay, a while ago, I applied to veterinary school in Bloomington, and I just found out that I got in.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"You did? That's amazing! Wait, why did you wait to tell me?",5,22
April Ludgate,"Because I don't even know if I wanna go, okay? I mean, yes, it's been my dream to work with animals since I was a kid and everything.",5,22
April Ludgate,"But it would mean I would be spending a lot of time apart from you, and",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we could get through that.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, look.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"It would suck for a while, and I would miss you while you're gone.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"But as I've known about you for the past 20 seconds, this is your dream.",5,22
April Ludgate,I'm really glad I married you.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, we made a good call on that one.",5,22
Tom Haverford,So I just wanted to let you know I will not be selling Rent-A-Swag.,5,22
Tom Haverford,And you can go tell your client he now has 100 problems?,5,22
Tom Haverford,Is it Jay-Z?,5,22
Trevor Nelson,No.,5,22
Trevor Nelson,"But since you're not taking the deal, I should inform you that my client will be moving on to plan B: Opening his own store directly across the street from yours.",5,22
Tom Haverford,Across the street? What kind of store is it gonna be?,5,22
Trevor Nelson,"He's calling it ""Tommy's Closet.""",5,22
Trevor Nelson,"It's a high-end secondhand clothing store where parents can rent clothes for their teens, tweens, and pres, as well as babies, toddlers, grown-ups, and olds.",5,22
Tom Haverford,But that's my idea and my name.,5,22
Trevor Nelson,So I guess only Domino's is allowed to sell pizza now?,5,22
Trevor Nelson,"It's called capitalism, Mr. Haverford, and you are about to get a free lesson.",5,22
Trevor Nelson,Only this free lesson is going to cost you.,5,22
Tom Haverford,So it's not free?,5,22
Trevor Nelson,You're right.,5,22
Trevor Nelson,That was confusing.,5,22
Trevor Nelson,This lesson will cost you.,5,22
Trevor Nelson,Good day.,5,22
Tom Haverford,"This sucks, but I have to admit: It's a pretty baller move.",5,22
Tom Haverford,You sure this isn't Diddy?,5,22
Trevor Nelson,It is Diddy.,5,22
Tom Haverford,I knew it!,5,22
Trevor Nelson,It's not Diddy.,5,22
Andy Dwyer,Are you sure everything will be all right if April goes to vet school?,5,22
Ron Swanson,"There are no sure things in life, son, but you two seem pretty solid to me.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Change is good, I guess.",5,22
Ron Swanson,Not to me.,5,22
Ron Swanson,Leslie's going around asking everybody if they're better off than they were a year ago.,5,22
Ron Swanson,All I care about is that I'm the same.,5,22
Ron Swanson,"If I'm the same as I was a year ago, I'm happy.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, I forgot.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,Who the hell is pregnant?,5,22
Ron Swanson,What?,5,22
Andy Dwyer,"I found a pregnancy test at your cabin, and I checked with all the girls over there.",5,22
Andy Dwyer,It wasn't any of them.,5,22

Trevor Nelson,It's not Lebron James.,6,1
Tom Haverford,Damn.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think ""No problem too small"" is working.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers.",6,1

Ben Wyatt,"Um, I'm gonna say no.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,You sure?,6,1
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,I can do one.,6,1

Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,Everyone saw it.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, ""everyone""?",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"She's calling it the ""Peepee-head"" speech.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Bloody hell, Jerry!",6,1
Jerry Gergich,So how's Lond,6,1
Chris Traeger,I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.,6,1
Chris Traeger,It's a very special day.,6,1
Chris Traeger,Okay.,6,1
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Donna.",6,1
Ann Perkins,So,6,1
Donna Meagle,You're pregnant.,6,1
Ann Perkins,"Oh, man, Tom told you.",6,1
Donna Meagle,Nope.,6,1
Donna Meagle,"You're drinking decaf coffee, which you usually only do in the afternoon, you're wearing an empire waist dress and loose shoes 'cause your feet are already swelling.",6,1
Donna Meagle,"I'd put you at nine, maybe ten weeks.",6,1
Chris Traeger,"My goodness, you're observant.",6,1
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I am.",6,1
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I am.",6,1
Donna Meagle,Hmm.,6,1
Donna Meagle,When did you make the switch to boxer briefs?,6,1
Chris Traeger,Yesterday.,6,1
Ann Perkins,"Okay, please stop looking at him.",6,1
Leslie Knope,Why are we here?,6,1
Ron Swanson,"Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not.",6,1
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.,6,1
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here.",6,1
Ron Swanson,"When your kid screams ""I hate you,"" you don't sink to his level and yell ""I hate you"" back.",6,1
Ron Swanson,You have to be the grownup.,6,1
Leslie Knope,You're right.,6,1
Leslie Knope,I know.,6,1
Leslie Knope,I have to be the grownup.,6,1
Leslie Knope,But it's so hard!,6,1
Leslie Knope,Ron!,6,1
Leslie Knope,God!,6,1
Leslie Knope,And nobody ever thanks you.,6,1
Ron Swanson,"You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you.",6,1
Ron Swanson,"And by the way, April thanked you.",6,1
Ron Swanson,She nominated you for this award.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, April does that all the time.",6,1
Leslie Knope,She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.,6,1
Ron Swanson,"April respects you, and so do many others.",6,1
Ron Swanson,Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.,6,1
Ron Swanson,That way lies madness.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I almost forgot.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many.",6,1
Ron Swanson,A train ticket?,6,1
Ron Swanson,You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent?,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you do.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.",6,1
Ron Swanson,"Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen?",6,1
Leslie Knope,"This is London, Ron.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops.",6,1
Ron Swanson,"Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first.",6,1
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Jerry.",6,1
Chris Traeger,I didn't know you were working today.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, Ron asked me to come in while he's away.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Of course, I had to cancel my cardiologist appoint--",6,1
Chris Traeger,That's great.,6,1
Chris Traeger,"Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting.",6,1
Chris Traeger,"Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God, that's wonderful news!",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, there's so much in front of you.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, soon you're gonna start showing, and then your clothes will feel tight, and then, oh, people are gonna start rubbing your tummy all the time!",6,1
Ann Perkins,That sounds terrible.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Gayle, she got really queasy, and I gained a lot of sympathy weight.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"You know, actually, before my kids, I looked a lot like you, Chris.",6,1
Chris Traeger,I'm very sad.,6,1
Chris Traeger,Please stop talking.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"And, of course, pretty soon, Ann, your milk is gonna come in.",6,1
Ann Perkins,Ohh.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,That is exciting.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Yep, and it happens sooner than you'd think.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,The babies can sense it.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"You would be shocked, 'cause they are rooting around for that nipple.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Gimme, gimme.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,I want milk!,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm, mm.",6,1
Jerry Gergich,Ohh.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,Life is a miracle.,6,1
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm.",6,1
April Ludgate,So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I guess.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I can't do it, obviously.",6,1
April Ludgate,Why?,6,1
Andy Dwyer,I don't even know what I would be doing.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, besides, this is England.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,Everything is so weird.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,It's all different.,6,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,Do they?,6,1
Andy Dwyer,I'll be damned.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, like that.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,That's what I'm exactly what I'm talking about.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to?,6,1
Andy Dwyer,Not even a circus.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,"There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,One bearded lady.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,She got all rude when I marveled at her.,6,1
April Ludgate,Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy?,6,1
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, he's awesome.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,He's everything you would want in a boss.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,Total package.,6,1
April Ludgate,I think you should do it.,6,1
April Ludgate,When are you gonna have another opportunity like this?,6,1
Andy Dwyer,I mean,6,1
April Ludgate,"And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay?",6,1
April Ludgate,"Remember, I was in Washington last year.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,He said he wanted me to head up the company.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea how to run a nonprofit.,6,1
April Ludgate,Hey.,6,1
April Ludgate,You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.,6,1
April Ludgate,"Come on, you can hack this.",6,1
April Ludgate,I believe in you.,6,1
April Ludgate,"But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,Seems like the only logical solution.,6,1
Chris Traeger,"My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant.",6,1
Chris Traeger,And I'm the baby daddy!,6,1
Ethel Beavers,How wonderful for you.,6,1
Chris Traeger,You don't seem very excited for us.,6,1
Ethel Beavers,"I barely know you, and I don't have to talk to you unless it's about work.",6,1
Ann Perkins,"Man, I thought this would be more satisfying.",6,1
Chris Traeger,I agree.,6,1
Chris Traeger,"Wait a minute, what time is it? Has she landed yet?",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go.",6,1
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna let you go.,6,1
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods.",6,1
Ann Perkins,That's for a hangover.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Right, yeah, of course.",6,1
Leslie Knope,I'm so goofed-up right now.,6,1
Leslie Knope,I'm so jet-lagged.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called ""Zapvigil,"" which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding.",6,1
Leslie Knope,I know it's Ann.,6,1
Chris Traeger,We are so glad you're back.,6,1
Chris Traeger,"We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for.",6,1
Ann Perkins,"And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones.",6,1
Leslie Knope,Ohh.,6,1
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, welcome home!",6,1
Leslie Knope,Don't pinch me!,6,1
Tom Haverford,"Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting.",6,1
Tom Haverford,It's really a dream come true.,6,1
Tom Haverford,"Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tom, lawyer guy daddy Tom did not screw me out of the company.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening.",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,"So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened?",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Daddy-D! Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time! All those math camps I said I went to? I don't even know what a math camp is!",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,"So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Trophies I bought,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I also have something to say.,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I have done nothing wrong, ever, in my life.",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,I know this and I love you.,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I love you too, daddy.",6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please! My money.",6,1
Tom Haverford,"Dr. Saperstein, your son is my best friend.",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,Yeah.,6,1
Tom Haverford,He's like a brother to me.,6,1
Tom Haverford,"But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum.",6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mm.,6,1
Tom Haverford,On an island,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Ooh.,6,1
Tom Haverford,In space.,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hold on,6,1
Dr. Saperstein,These two have been huge disappointments to me.,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Come on, you love us.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets.",6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Dad!,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!",6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"But seriously, what are we doing here, though?",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What are we doing here, dad?",6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Like, what is this?",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why are we here?,6,1
Tom Haverford,So So now you know the truth.,6,1
Tom Haverford,Will you back off?,6,1
Dr. Saperstein,"No, I will not stop.",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,"Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now.",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,"Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time? No, I'm not gonna back off.",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,"I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you! All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night?",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes!,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yes, daddy.",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,Huh? Blow me a kiss.,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Mwah!,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mwah.,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,#NAME?,6,1
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I love you, daddy!",6,1
Dr. Saperstein,Me too.,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I love you, daddy!",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone?",6,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, we'll be fine.",6,1
April Ludgate,Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here?,6,1
Leslie Knope,April,6,1
April Ludgate,What? I don't trust him.,6,1
April Ludgate,I never have.,6,1
April Ludgate,He's after your money.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.",6,1
April Ludgate,"And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia.",6,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away.",6,1
Leslie Knope,Isn't that great?,6,1
Gretel,I didn't want all the slugs gone.,6,1
Gretel,I wanted most of them gone!,6,1
Leslie Knope,Sorry.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll put one slug back.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Either way, your problem is solved.",6,1
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that lady is the worst.",6,1
April Ludgate,She didn't even say thank you.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"That's not why we do this, April.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause.",6,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out?",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all.",6,1
Leslie Knope,But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs.,6,1
Leslie Knope,All right.,6,1
Leslie Knope,On to the next complaint.,6,1
Ron Swanson,"Where the hell are you sending me, Knope?",6,1
Jessica Wicks,"Morning, cutie.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,"Morning, Jessica.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.,6,1
Jessica Wicks,"These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington.",6,1
Jessica Wicks,He was very impressed with you two.,6,1
Jessica Wicks,He sounded rich on the phone.,6,1
Jessica Wicks,I think he was calling me from a helicopter.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,Could be.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,He owns two.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,So Andy's gonna stay there for three months.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,I hope he's okay.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,He sent me an email this morning.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, this isn't right.",6,1
Andy Dwyer,None of this looks familiar.,6,1
Andy Dwyer,Eddie?,6,1
Jessica Wicks,"Uh-oh, Spaghettios.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust.",6,1
Jessica Wicks,"No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase.",6,1
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, my.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,6,1
Jessica Wicks,"Come on, Sugarbutt!",6,1
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, which one's Sugarbutt?",6,1
Jessica Wicks,That's you! Come on.,6,1
Jessica Wicks,"We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,Wildly inappropriate.,6,1
Tom Haverford,Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up?,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I doubt it.,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"He never gives up on anything, except for my mom.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When she turned 30, he was like, ""Get out!""",6,1
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should just throw in the towel.,6,1
Tom Haverford,Your dad'll destroy me.,6,1
Tom Haverford,I'll be left with nothing.,6,1
Tom Haverford,Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg.,6,1
Tom Haverford,Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"First of all, unbelievable analogy.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Second of all, what are you talking about, man? You're Tommy Haverford! You're an idea man.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher.",6,1
Tom Haverford,You're right.,6,1
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I'm basically Babyface.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You're basically Babyface!,6,1
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That's what I'm talking about! And for me, it's a win-win either way.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies.",6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.,6,1
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You want to come?,6,1
Tom Haverford,No!,6,1
Ann Perkins,"I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know?",6,1
Chris Traeger,"You know what I just read? Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive.",6,1
Chris Traeger,Isn't that wild?,6,1
Ann Perkins,It is.,6,1
Chris Traeger,A green olive.,6,1
Chris Traeger,A little high in sodium.,6,1
Chris Traeger,I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato.,6,1
Ann Perkins,Our baby's not a salad.,6,1
Chris Traeger,"Yes, right.",6,1
Ann Perkins,"It's just weird, you know? I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing.",6,1
Ann Perkins,"Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs.",6,1
Chris Traeger,It's still just our thing.,6,1
Chris Traeger,It'll always be just our thing.,6,1
Chris Traeger,That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.,6,1
Ann Perkins,"You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl.",6,1
Chris Traeger,"I prefer ""Chickpea.""",6,1
Ann Perkins,Because it's lower in sodium?,6,1
Chris Traeger,"Yes, exactly.",6,1
Ann Perkins,Okay.,6,1
April Ludgate,Hey.,6,1
Leslie Knope,Hey.,6,1
April Ludgate,Are you leaving?,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Let's see, it is ""48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon.""",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, brother.",6,1
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you.",6,1
April Ludgate,"I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours.",6,1
April Ludgate,"So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face.",6,1
April Ludgate,Okay?,6,1
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,1
April Ludgate,Please sit.,6,1
April Ludgate,"""Dear award committee members"" Leslie, I didn't even start.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry.",6,1
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.,6,1
April Ludgate,"""Dear award committee members, where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, people who don't care at all about what they do""or how they do it.""",6,1

April Ludgate,"""That's what I love about her, and that's why she deserves this award.""",6,1
April Ludgate,"""Sincerely Satan.""",6,1
Leslie Knope,You're getting hugged right now.,6,1
April Ludgate,"No, I told you not to.",6,1
Leslie Knope,I'm giving you a hug.,6,1
April Ludgate,No! I told you not to. Stay away!,6,1
April Ludgate,No!,6,1
Ron Swanson,All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.,6,1
Ron Swanson,"But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption.",6,1
Ron Swanson,This is worth the trip.,6,1
Ron Swanson,"""Dear Ron, you have now reached the cliffsides overlooking the islands.""",6,1

Ron Swanson,I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,Nice to be home.,6,1
Leslie Knope,It is.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it.",6,1
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,"We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us.",6,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,6,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's one more thing I want to try.",6,1
Ben Wyatt,Mm.,6,1
Leslie Knope,I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,Oh.,6,1
Leslie Knope,Wear it for me.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?,6,1
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,All right.,6,1
Ben Wyatt,What's up?,6,1
Leslie Knope,"No, not sexy.",6,1
Leslie Knope,Failed experiment.,6,1

Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here's the text I added a few more jokes, slamming Eagleton at the end.",6,2
Leslie Knope,Mmm.,6,2
Leslie Knope,That's the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.,6,2
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're on my team.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure you wanna attack 'em at this press conference?,6,2
Ben Wyatt,It's a friendly wager on a high school basketball game.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"I'm losing the recall election, Ben.",6,2
Leslie Knope,Slamming Eagleton is the easiest way to score some points.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Look.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Am I proud of it?,6,2
Leslie Knope,Yes.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Because Eagleton sucks.,6,2
Leslie Knope,But is it the classiest move?,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks.",6,2
Leslie Knope,Would I do it again?,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"This year, we get to host the Pawnee Eagleton tipoff classic.",6,2
Leslie Knope,That awful human being is Ingrid de Forest.,6,2
Leslie Knope,She's a city councilor from Eagleton.,6,2
Leslie Knope,She thinks she's so great because she won the Miss Indiana Beauty Pageant.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Last year.,6,2
Leslie Knope,While she was in office.,6,2
Leslie Knope,And pregnant.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Ew, pesticide.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,Yuck.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, these are pesticide free.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, Leslie, I think we had similar ideas.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"If you win, Eagleton will give you this basket of oranges.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Of course, it's silly to compare apples and oranges, but what the heck.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"These are made of Swarovski crystal, and they're worth 700,000 dollars.",6,2
Extra,"Leslie, you're down 15 points in the latest poll for the recall election.",6,2
Extra,What can you do to make up the deficit?,6,2
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I'd do if I was an Eagletonian.,6,2
Leslie Knope,I'd pop a Xanax and ask my butler to help me out.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not saying that Eagletonians are out of touch.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"But when you tell 'em it's time to change their oil, they ask, ""Extra virgin or white truffle?""",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys.",6,2
Leslie Knope,I'll see ya at the game.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Unless, of course, you're an Eagletonian, and then you'll be too busy polishing your monocle at the caviar store.",6,2
Leslie Knope,Knope out.,6,2

Chris Traeger,What a hilarious word.,6,2
Chris Traeger,It reminds me of a ridiculous donkey.,6,2
Chris Traeger,He's the best.,6,2
Leslie Knope,What does this mean for them?,6,2
Ben Wyatt,"They were in financial trouble a few years ago, like Pawnee was, but their government just kept borrowing money.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,Eagleton is on the brink of an epic financial disaster.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Ahh.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Now that is the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Really, that?",6,2
Leslie Knope,This is gonna hand me the recall election.,6,2

April Ludgate,Mmmm.,6,2
Ann Perkins,Come on.,6,2
April Ludgate,"God, get off me, stranger.",6,2

Ingrid de Forest,We came from our bankruptcy brunch.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"And Michael Buble played, but he ran a little long.",6,2
Chris Traeger,I love Michael Buble.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,Was a bankruptcy brunch the best idea?,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Sure, let's not have brunch like animals.",6,2
Chris Traeger,"Well, um, some of these expenditures are questionable.",6,2
Chris Traeger,"Uh, you filled the public pools with bottled water?",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,Total body hydration.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,What is this here?,6,2
Ben Wyatt,This massive expenditure from public works?,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Ah, yes.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, yes.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,We purchased HBO for the whole town.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,You spent government money on a TV subscription?,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,It's not TV.,6,2
Chris Traeger,Alright.,6,2
Chris Traeger,"Uh, Leslie's put together a presentation for a financial recovery.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,Great.,6,2
Leslie Knope,You may find it very informative.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Let's get started with our first slide.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"""Well, well, well"" Tsk, tsk, tsk.",6,2
Ron Swanson,"JJ, a few months ago, I came in here and began eating eggs.",6,2
Ron Swanson,"They were delicious, so I ordered more.",6,2
Ron Swanson,"Before long, I believe I had eaten",6,2
JJ,51 eggs in 20 minutes.,6,2
JJ,Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.,6,2
JJ,The last ten were still in the shell.,6,2
Tom Haverford,"It was a JJ's Diner record, and you took his picture.",6,2
Tom Haverford,"Now, we need that picture, for privacy reasons.",6,2
JJ,"Okay, but I don't know how anybody would know it's you.",6,2
JJ,We followed your instructions.,6,2
Ron Swanson,That's too much information.,6,2
Ron Swanson,Let's go.,6,2
Tom Haverford,Where are we going now?,6,2
Ron Swanson,I've eaten a lot of food in a lot of restaurants.,6,2
Ron Swanson,Why is everyone else so bad at eating?,6,2
April Ludgate,I only agreed to come back here because of our deal.,6,2
April Ludgate,Do you promise to play along?,6,2
Ann Perkins,Yes.,6,2
April Ludgate,Do you?,6,2
Ann Perkins,Yes.,6,2
Laura,"Hi, you're back.",6,2
April Ludgate,Hello again.,6,2

Ann Perkins,"Yes, that's who I am.",6,2
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, we'd love to hear about Bloomington.",6,2
Ann Perkins,It seems like a real hip kind of college town.,6,2
April Ludgate,"Meemaw, God, no one uses the word hip anymore.",6,2
April Ludgate,Sometimes I wish you went down on the Titanic with all your sorority sisters.,6,2
Laura,I would be happy to show you guys around the campus.,6,2
Laura,Is there anything in particular that you wanna see?,6,2
April Ludgate,How are your local graveyards?,6,2
April Ludgate,I have some planning to do.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"""You blew it.""",6,2
Leslie Knope,"""Super hard.""",6,2
Leslie Knope,"""Complete buffoonery.""",6,2
Leslie Knope,"""It's hilarious.""",6,2
Leslie Knope,"And ""You deserve it.""",6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you think you might wanna take it easy on them a little bit?",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like they took it easy on us when they stole all our money and seceded from our town?",6,2
Ben Wyatt,That was 200 years ago.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,Cool it.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Fine.,6,2
Leslie Knope,I'll skip ahead.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,Do you have a plan that will help us or not?,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,We have borrowed absolutely everything we can from the state.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"And really, Pawnee is our only hope.",6,2
Leslie Knope,We do have a plan.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"We are willing to provide a bridge loan for 50,000 dollars.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"25% interest, compounded monthly.",6,2
Leslie Knope,And you need to release a statement that says that Pawnee rules and Eagleton drools.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, now you're just being nasty.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"I understand that our towns have a complicated history, but we have a saying in Eagleton ""You don't kick a dressage horse after a failed pas de deux.""",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, blondie.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Your butler made your bed, now you gotta lie in it.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"And if you walk out that door, none of us here, and I repeat, none of us will ever help you again.",6,2
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God.",6,2
Chris Traeger,They have Michael Buble on retainer.,6,2
Ron Swanson,"Okay, all public photos of me recovered.",6,2
Ron Swanson,Nameplate removed from my office door.,6,2
Ron Swanson,Pediatrician files confiscated and destroyed.,6,2

Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Laura, for showing us around.",6,2
Laura,Sure.,6,2
Laura,"See you in a couple weeks, April.",6,2
Ann Perkins,See?,6,2
Ann Perkins,This place is great.,6,2
Ann Perkins,Aren't you glad we came back and talked to her?,6,2
April Ludgate,No.,6,2
April Ludgate,It was pointless.,6,2
April Ludgate,I'm not going to school here.,6,2
Ann Perkins,"April, don't flake out on this.",6,2
Ann Perkins,You're gonna love it here.,6,2
Ann Perkins,Bloomington is great.,6,2
Ann Perkins,It's got culture and music and tons of youngsters.,6,2
Ann Perkins,Youngsters?,6,2
Ann Perkins,Am I 65 years old?,6,2
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'm not going here.",6,2
April Ludgate,I don't want to.,6,2
April Ludgate,Let's leave.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Think fast.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,Oh!,6,2
Ben Wyatt,Why do people keep assuming I'm ready to catch things?,6,2
Chris Traeger,"""Eagleton: No money, mo' problems.""",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Fantastic, right?",6,2
Leslie Knope,I made enough of them for everybody to wear at the game.,6,2
Chris Traeger,I do like a good internal rhyme.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you ready for dinner?",6,2
Leslie Knope,We can go over the poll numbers.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Oh you know, I've got a few phone calls to make.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,Can you give me an hour?,6,2
Leslie Knope,I can meet you there.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",6,2
Leslie Knope,What is she doing here?,6,2
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but you didn't really help them very much, so we volunteered to give them a little financial advice.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,You didn't actually help us at all.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,Just one second.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,Yeah.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just gonna help them out, okay?",6,2
Leslie Knope,Mm.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,Just for an hour.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,He's just being a good neighbor.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"We're in a lot of trouble, Leslie.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"I don't need any lip from you, okay?",6,2
Leslie Knope,You're in trouble because of your own stupidity.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,I have a PhD from the Sorbonne.,6,2
Leslie Knope,For what?,6,2
Leslie Knope,Wearing Chanel suits?,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"There was a fashion component, yes.",6,2
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad that you're doing this.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am mad that you're doing this.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"But even worse, I'm mad that you just lied to me about it.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm sorry.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"We all swore that we weren't gonna ever help her again, ever.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,I never said that.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,You did.,6,2
Leslie Knope,I speak for all of us in all matters.,6,2
Leslie Knope,That is what you tacitly agreed to when you married me.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,What?,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, let's go.",6,2
Leslie Knope,You've changed your mind.,6,2
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna help her anymore.,6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Leslie, I just wanna borrow your husband for the evening.",6,2
Ann Perkins,Can we please talk about what happened back there?,6,2
April Ludgate,"What, Ann?",6,2
April Ludgate,I just stole your phone and texted every guy in it that the baby was theirs.,6,2
April Ludgate,It's not that big of a deal.,6,2
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know you don't believe this, but I care about your future.",6,2
Ann Perkins,And I'm just a little disappointed that you're just not following through with this.,6,2
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not about following through, okay?",6,2
April Ludgate,I was on the fence about whether I wanted to do it.,6,2
April Ludgate,"And as soon as I got there, I just had a gut feeling that it wasn't right for me, that's all.",6,2
Ann Perkins,"So, just like that, boom huge life decision made?",6,2
April Ludgate,That's how I make all my life decisions.,6,2
April Ludgate,"My gut is always right, okay?",6,2
April Ludgate,"It was right about marrying Andy, and it was right when it told me that you would be the worst person I would ever meet in my life.",6,2
April Ludgate,"And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann.",6,2
April Ludgate,So gross!,6,2
Ann Perkins,How do you get your gut to talk to you?,6,2
April Ludgate,You don't get your gut to talk to you.,6,2
April Ludgate,You just listen when it says something.,6,2
Ann Perkins,"Well, right now my gut is saying that we are going to listen to Mariah Carey the whole way home.",6,2
April Ludgate,Good.,6,2
Leslie Knope,Whoa.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm really surprised you're sitting on this side of the bleachers and not on the Eagleton side with your new girlfriend Ingrid.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I'm just trying to help them.",6,2
Leslie Knope,Why?,6,2
Leslie Knope,They wouldn't help us if the tables were turned.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're 50 points ahead, and they're still dunking.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at this guy.",6,2
Leslie Knope,There's no way he is in high school.,6,2
Extra,"And I'm better at French horn too, Eric.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,"People are gonna lose their jobs, Leslie.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,And the recovery will take years.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Deep down, I think you feel bad for them.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I do a little, yes.",6,2
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry that I blew up at you yesterday.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"With all the recall stuff happening, I just really need to feel like you're on my team, and seeing you with them made me feel like you weren't.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,I'm always gonna be on your team.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,You never have to worry about that.,6,2
Extra,Defense!,6,2
Extra,"Oh! Eagleton player number seven, injured on the play.",6,2
Extra,Official time-out.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God.",6,2
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say something.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"And if I throw up on you after I say it, just know that you've been warned.",6,2
Leslie Knope,I know how we can help Eagleton.,6,2
Ron Swanson,I don't see what the problem is.,6,2
Ron Swanson,I will give you a certain amount of gold in exchange for a recreational vehicle.,6,2
Extra,I still need an address for insurance purposes.,6,2
Ron Swanson,This will be my new home.,6,2
Ron Swanson,The address is wherever it is parked.,6,2
Diane Lewis,"Where have you been? I had a flat tire, and I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours.",6,2
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, darling.",6,2
Ron Swanson,I've been busy destroying most of my personal effects and threatening a postal worker.,6,2
Diane Lewis,"Ron, I know you value your privacy, but you are a husband and a father now.",6,2
Diane Lewis,You can't just roam the streets in an RV and be impossible to find.,6,2
Ron Swanson,I'm on a mission to get off the grid.,6,2
Diane Lewis,"Well, you don't have to be entirely on the grid, but have to be on our grid.",6,2
Ron Swanson,I suppose you wouldn't consider moving.,6,2
Ron Swanson,I've heard the school system in the tunnels beneath Yucca Mountain is adequate.,6,2
Diane Lewis,"I love you, but your solution to every problem is to live inside a mountain.",6,2
Ron Swanson,I love you too.,6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, one more time.",6,2
Ben Wyatt,"Are you absolutely sure you wanna go through with this? A lot of people are gonna get angry, and you might lose the recall election.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Or, if I pull it off, I just might win.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Plus, a very smart member of my team pointed out it's the right thing to do.",6,2
Leslie Knope,Good morning.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"After an all-night strategy session, the towns of Pawnee and Eagleton have come up with a potential solution to Eagleton's budget crisis.",6,2
Leslie Knope,The town of Eagleton will be dissolved and re-absorbed into Pawnee.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee will provide some government services, as well as taking on some of Eagleton's debts.",6,2
Leslie Knope,I understand.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"Look, I hate Eagletonians as much as you do.",6,2
Leslie Knope,I hate their stupid beautiful faces and their stupid shiny hair.,6,2
Chris Traeger,We looked at every alternative.,6,2
Chris Traeger,This is the only scenario that prevents Eagleton's financial crisis from spiraling throughout the entire region.,6,2
Chance Frenlm,Eagleton is terrible! Why should I bail them out with the hard-earned money from my unemployment check?,6,2
Extra,Yeah!,6,2
Leslie Knope,Because they are our neighbor and they've sprained their ankle.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"And when your neighbor sprains his ankle, you help him off the court.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"I understand you have concerns and questions, and we are here to listen to them.",6,2
Herman Lerpiss,I got something to say.,6,2
Leslie Knope,"One at a time, please.",6,2
Mel,I hate the one-at-a-time system!,6,2
Herman Lerpiss,Why should we bail them out? No one bailed me out when I got arrested for arson.,6,2
Extra,You can't just merge two towns.,6,2
Extra,It's against the rules of nature.,6,2
Extra,What's next-- merging a man with his dog?,6,2
Bertram Rolands,I live in Eagleton.,6,2
Bertram Rolands,"And frankly, I don't like the idea of living in Pawnee.",6,2
Bertram Rolands,"They're a little-- oh, what's the word? Have-no-money.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Bertram, that's enough.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"First of all, Eagleton has no money.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"Second of all, they are gracious enough to throw us a lifeline, and we should be eternally grateful for their generosity.",6,2
Ingrid de Forest,"They're a town of angels-- greasy, denim-clad angels, but angels nonetheless.",6,2
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll take it.",6,2
Donna Meagle,"I mean, did you steal this from a museum?",6,2
Donna Meagle,Maybe find it frozen in ice?,6,2
Donna Meagle,It looks like the original phone from the movie Wall Street.,6,2
Tom Haverford,"I think it's just the original phone, period.",6,2
Tom Haverford,"Ew, gross, it has ""buttons.""",6,2
Diane Lewis,"Okay, girls, this is a magic phone, okay? Only you and I have got the numbers.",6,2
Diane Lewis,"So if you ever need Ron for any reason, you just call and he'll be there in a flash.",6,2
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I will.",6,2
Ron Swanson,I'll keep it right here.,6,2
Ron Swanson,"It snaps right in, snug and secure.",6,2
Tom Haverford,"A cell phone belt clip? No, Ron.",6,2

,Season: 6 Episode: 03,6,3
Leslie Knope,This is a historic day.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"At 12:01 this morning, the city of Eagleton ceased to exist and was reabsorbed back into Pawnee.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Things are exactly the way they were back in 1817, except, you know, women and minorities can vote, we have indoor toilets, and we no longer burn widows for learning arithmetic.",6,3
Chris Traeger,"Councilwoman Knope is your merger czar, and in the binders that she's provided, you will find directions to your department in Pawnee that most closely matches your department in Eagleton.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"There are two Eagleton departments Pawnee does not have: the Department of Infinity Pool Design and the Department of Dressage, which I am told is a fancy horseriding thing.",6,3
Extra,"It is horse dancing, madam.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take it easy, Alonzo.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"All you horse dancing people, sit in your saddles if you will.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, welcome to your new departments.",6,3

Leslie Knope,"Donna, you'll be with Craig.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"April, you'll be with someone named Tynnyfer.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"And Ron, your guy is also named Ron.",6,3
Tom Haverford,Guess there's no Tom Haverford equivalent.,6,3
Tom Haverford,"Not surprised, I'm one of a kind, just like the custom Nikes I designed that say ""Tommy's Tootsies"" across the toes.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"You do have a counterpart, actually.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"His name is Eric, and I've heard he's amazing.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I also have a little surprise.",6,3
Leslie Knope,I would like to introduce our new filing temp.,6,3
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, everybody.",6,3
April Ludgate,No!,6,3
Tom Haverford,"No, why?",6,3
Tom Haverford,This can't be happening.,6,3
Ron Swanson,"Why, Leslie?",6,3
Leslie Knope,We brought Jerry out of retirement because we have a mountain of filing to get through.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Jerry Gergich.",6,3
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Leslie.",6,3
Jerry Gergich,"And as long as we're starting out fresh, Leslie, I was wondering if people would call me by my real name.",6,3
April Ludgate,Larry?,6,3
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's not Larry.",6,3
Jerry Gergich,It's Jerry.,6,3
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's Gary.",6,3

Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm trying to save as many jobs as possible, but we're gonna have to lose some people.",6,3
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure who we should keep.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"April, Tom and Donna are three of the best human beings that have ever lived.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Ron is basically a better version of George Washington.,6,3
Leslie Knope,But the Eagletonians are probably good too.,6,3
Chris Traeger,"Today, we are not just merging two towns.",6,3
Chris Traeger,We're throwing a birthday party for a new city.,6,3
Chris Traeger,"Happy birthday, New Pawnee.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,Party's over.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,"You guys lost millions of taxpayer dollars, and we have to clean up the obscene mess you've made.",6,3

Ben Wyatt,I don't care.,6,3
Chris Traeger,"When we were state auditors, we had an amazing system.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up and made them feel positive and happy.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,And I swooped in and slashed their budgets to ribbons.,6,3
Chris Traeger,Like a majestic alleyoop.,6,3
Chris Traeger,You're all amazing!,6,3
Ben Wyatt,You're all fired.,6,3
Chris Traeger,Teamwork.,6,3

Craig Middlebrooks,It's so boring.,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,Sounds like someone's cousin.,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,Craig!,6,3

Craig Middlebrooks,Everything!,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,"I carried the Eagleton department on my shoulders for years, and I loved every second of it.",6,3

April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, was your name Jennifer?",6,3
Tynnyfer,"No, it's Tynnyfer with two y's.",6,3
Tynnyfer,"I used to be Jennifer, but then I decided to rebrand myself.",6,3
Tynnyfer,"Oh, wait, hang on.",6,3
Tynnyfer,It's Xanax o'clock.,6,3

April Ludgate,"My name's April, and I just wanted to say that your dress is so cute it's bonks.",6,3
Tynnyfer,"I saw my spinning instructor wearing it, and I was like, ""Shut up.""",6,3

Ragiv,I'm here to install it.,6,3
Tom Haverford,But scheduling's the main part of my job.,6,3
Ragiv,You still have a human being in charge of booking tennis courts?,6,3
Ragiv,"What is this, 1990?",6,3
Ragiv,I guess that explains the shoulder pads.,6,3
Tom Haverford,How did he notice these?,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this is a surprise.",6,3
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I just wanted to chat for a sec.",6,3
Ann Perkins,"You know, just so you could hear some things from me.",6,3
Ann Perkins,Verbal things from my mouth.,6,3
Ann Perkins,Did that sound weird?,6,3
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?,6,3
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, everything's fine.",6,3
Ann Perkins,"First of all, this is Evelyn.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello.",6,3
Ann Perkins,She is my Health Department counterpart from Eagleton.,6,3
Evelyn,There really wasn't a ton of work for me there.,6,3
Evelyn,Eagletonians are very healthy.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, this might be a very interesting challenge for you, because Pawnee has the very first documented case of megadiabetes.",6,3
Leslie Knope,And the only know occurrence of Lou Gehrig's other disease.,6,3
Leslie Knope,We've been written about in textbooks.,6,3
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Evelyn, I'll see you back in my office.",6,3
Ann Perkins,I just need to talk some more words into Leslie's face.,6,3
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.,6,3
Leslie Knope,Ahem.,6,3
Leslie Knope,Wow.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I feel sorry for her.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"I mean, nobody can fill your shoes, Ann.",6,3
Leslie Knope,With your tiny little doll feet.,6,3
Ann Perkins,"Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.",6,3
Ann Perkins,"I, uh, I'm gonna step down, and I'm gonna turn my job over to Evelyn.",6,3
Leslie Knope,What?,6,3
Leslie Knope,No.,6,3
Leslie Knope,Did somebody put you up to this?,6,3
Leslie Knope,Was it Evelyn?,6,3
Leslie Knope,I knew she was a monster.,6,3
Ann Perkins,No.,6,3
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no.",6,3
Ann Perkins,"Chris and I have been talking, and we are thinking very seriously about leaving Pawnee and moving somewhere else to start our family",6,3
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, look at that.",6,3
Ann Perkins,It's waffles!,6,3

Leslie Knope,"So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me you're not thinking about leaving Pawnee.",6,3
Ann Perkins,I am thinking about leaving.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Is this one of those classic Ann ""not"" jokes?",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Like, ""I'm leaving Pawnee not!""",6,3
Ann Perkins,I don't do that.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that you had started.,6,3
Ann Perkins,It's not definite.,6,3
Ann Perkins,It's just neither of us are from Pawnee.,6,3
Ann Perkins,And I have a whole family in Michigan.,6,3
Ann Perkins,And Chris is missing life in a bigger city.,6,3
Ann Perkins,And I just wanted to talk to you about it so you could hear it from me.,6,3
Ann Perkins,Do you hear that galloping?,6,3
Leslie Knope,Hmm?,6,3
Ann Perkins,"Wha oh my, my look at that!",6,3
Ann Perkins,Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.,6,3
Ann Perkins,That's amazing!,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I've got a ton of work to do.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"I'm super busy, so you can let yourself",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Look, if Ann wants to leave Pawnee, I get it.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"I mean, who wants to stay in the greatest town in the world with her best friend and be happy forever when she can abandon her soul sister like an old shoe and move to a garbage city full of jerks.",6,3
Leslie Knope,I get it.,6,3
Leslie Knope,No hard feelings.,6,3
Tynnyfer,You have to text me.,6,3
April Ludgate,I will.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Sorry for the delay, ladies, I was busy being ambushed by treachery.",6,3
Leslie Knope,So did you have a chance to compare notes on your respective duties?,6,3
April Ludgate,Totally.,6,3
April Ludgate,"Tynny and I have been, like, totally bonding.",6,3
April Ludgate,We've just been like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!,6,3
April Ludgate,"Like, talking, like, so much forever.",6,3
Tynnyfer,It was all so delicious.,6,3
April Ludgate,"I know, right?",6,3
Tynnyfer,"This is, like, the best day ever.",6,3
April Ludgate,"I know, I'm eating it all up.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Wow.,6,3
Leslie Knope,It's nice to see a friendship blossoming instead of wiling away like a dying turd flower.,6,3
April Ludgate,Totes.,6,3
April Ludgate,"Um, we also came up with these nicknames for each other.",6,3
April Ludgate,Slut and Skank.,6,3
April Ludgate,"How crazemazing is that, Lez?",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what I think is crazemazing?",6,3
Leslie Knope,Commitment.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for someone who's in it for the long haul.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"We are basically creating a new version of Pawnee, and if Pawnee is gonna commit to one of you, you need to commit to Pawnee.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Tynnyfer, do you have kids?",6,3
Tynnyfer,"Ew, no.",6,3
Tynnyfer,I've had so much rejuvenation that I don't think a baby could get out of there if it tried.,6,3
April Ludgate,You know it.,6,3
Donna Meagle,I guess we can make a switch to Bermuda grass.,6,3
Donna Meagle,It's only 80 cents more per square foot?,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,What?,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,Gimme gimme gimme.,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,You want me to put Bermuda grass in a continental climate that's a six on Beaufort scale?,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,In a park with zero drainage?,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,"I want Kentucky bluegrass, I want a 10 percent discount, and I want you to apologize to my best friend Donna!",6,3
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, hi.",6,3
Donna Meagle,Is there and I'm just guessing here some kind of medication that you maybe need a lot of and have taken none of or maybe too much of today?,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, I have a medical condition all right.",6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,It's called caring too much!,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,And it's incurable!,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,Also I have eczema.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me a little about yourself.",6,3
Ron Dunn,"Well, I love the outdoors, love nature.",6,3
Ron Swanson,Amen.,6,3
Ron Dunn,I'm a big believer in environmental conservation.,6,3
Ron Dunn,Recycling and composting and the like.,6,3
Ron Dunn,I'm a yoga nut.,6,3
Ron Dunn,And I'm a nut nut.,6,3
Ron Dunn,"They make delicious milks, man.",6,3
Ron Dunn,"And I'm a vegan, of course.",6,3
Ron Dunn,Slowly working toward full freegan vegan.,6,3
Ron Swanson,What in God's name is freegan vegan?,6,3
Leslie Knope,You only eat vegetables that have been thrown out in people's dumpsters.,6,3
Ron Swanson,"What is on your foot, sir?",6,3
Ron Dunn,My trusty sandals.,6,3
Ron Dunn,I believe a man's feet should remain uncaged.,6,3
Ron Dunn,Same goes for all chickens.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, Eagleton Ron, we here in Pawnee value loyalty above all else.",6,3
Leslie Knope,So would you be opposed to signing an official loyalty pledge to our new town?,6,3
Ron Dunn,"As long as that new town were open to the ideals of communal living, everyone pitches in towards a common good.",6,3
Ron Dunn,"In the immortal words of Cat Stevens, ""If you want to be free, be free.""",6,3
Ron Swanson,I no longer like Ron.,6,3
Tom Haverford,ERIC is an amazing program.,6,3
Tom Haverford,"Fast, fun and easy to use.",6,3
Tom Haverford,But there's one thing no man or machine can beat Tom Haverford at talking mad trash till I get what I want.,6,3
Tom Haverford,This guy Eric is a disaster.,6,3
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?,6,3
Tom Haverford,Just a bad attitude.,6,3
Tom Haverford,"""Oh, I hate this place.""",6,3
Tom Haverford,"""Get me out here.""",6,3
Tom Haverford,That kind of thing.,6,3
Tom Haverford,And unreliable.,6,3
Tom Haverford,And racist.,6,3
Tom Haverford,I think he may have even been to jail.,6,3
Tom Haverford,"Although, you know, maybe those are just regular face tattoos.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Wow.,6,3
Leslie Knope,That's not good.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I should probably talk to him.,6,3
Tom Haverford,"Well, let me see if can turn him around.",6,3
Tom Haverford,I don't want to put this on your plate.,6,3
Tom Haverford,You have a lot to deal with.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom.",6,3
Leslie Knope,You're the best.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's take a look at this list of assets owned by the Eagleton government.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,400 Segway scooters.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,Sell 'em.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,They're gone.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,You had six fulltime baristas on the payroll.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,The baristas are gone.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,As are the masseurs.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,And the fulltime barista who provided coffee for the masseurs.,6,3
Chris Traeger,It is excellent having the old band back together again.,6,3
Chris Traeger,You know what?,6,3
Chris Traeger,This calls for some celebratory lunges.,6,3
Chris Traeger,One two,6,3
Leslie Knope,"All right, Donna.",6,3
Leslie Knope,There's gonna have to be some cutbacks.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"I mean, your job is secure, of course.",6,3
Leslie Knope,You're basically the glue of this department.,6,3
Leslie Knope,But I think Craig's gonna have to go.,6,3
Donna Meagle,"No, you should keep him.",6,3
Donna Meagle,"He's crazy intense, but I've never met anyone who cares more about this job.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Donna, I'm right here.",6,3
Donna Meagle,No joke.,6,3
Donna Meagle,He might care more than you.,6,3
Donna Meagle,"Honestly, if I had to choose between him and me, I'd choose him.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what are you saying?",6,3
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking about leaving?,6,3
Donna Meagle,"I wasn't planning on it, but I could.",6,3
Donna Meagle,"You know, I got the condo in Seattle, the fiance in Denver.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Huh?,6,3
Donna Meagle,It won't last.,6,3
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I would be happy to go back into retirement if you have to cut the staff.",6,3
Leslie Knope,What?,6,3
Leslie Knope,Even Larry wants out?,6,3
Leslie Knope,What the hell is happening here?,6,3
Leslie Knope,Does everybody think that running a town is just some game where people can come and go as they please?,6,3
Ann Perkins,"Okeydokey, Leslie.",6,3
Ann Perkins,You're mad at me.,6,3
Ann Perkins,Don't take it out on everybody else.,6,3
Ann Perkins,It's not fair.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's not fair.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to watch the Oscars with Ben alone this year.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Last year, don't you remember Angelina Jolie and the leg dress moment?",6,3
Leslie Knope,"He had, and I quote, ""no comment.""",6,3
Leslie Knope,How can you not have an extreme reaction about a dress like that?,6,3
Leslie Knope,It just doesn't make any sense!,6,3
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we need to talk.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann.",6,3
Leslie Knope,I can't understand you.,6,3
Leslie Knope,You've developed some accent from that new town you might move to!,6,3
Leslie Knope,It seems like no one around here understands the meaning of loyalty.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I am the merger czar.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I make the rules.,6,3
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna teach people the meaning of loyalty in a language they will understand-- complicated legalese.,6,3
Ron Swanson,"Knope, what are these contracts?",6,3
Leslie Knope,It's just a little something that I drew up for all the employees of the new town.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Basic boilerplate language, 50 year commitment, blah, blah, blah.",6,3
April Ludgate,"I'm so sorry, honey, but Tynny and I won't sign anything until we speak with our life coach.",6,3
Tom Haverford,"When Eric saw this, he smashed a bunch of computers.",6,3
Ron Swanson,Why are you doing this?,6,3
Leslie Knope,What's the big deal?,6,3
Leslie Knope,I'm just trying to stop time with legally binding friendship contracts.,6,3
Leslie Knope,What part of that do you not understand?,6,3
Ron Swanson,You have lost your mind.,6,3
April Ludgate,"I think you need a spa day, Les.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Fine!,6,3
Leslie Knope,You only have to work here until I'm dead!,6,3
Leslie Knope,Is that better?,6,3
Ron Swanson,What in the name of all that is holy is that smell?,6,3
Ron Dunn,Yerba matte tea.,6,3
Ron Dunn,Sweetened with stevia.,6,3
Ron Dunn,It's an allnatural plant extract.,6,3
Ron Swanson,Shut your damn mouth.,6,3
Ron Dunn,No need to curse.,6,3
Ron Swanson,There most certainly is.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all Eagleton people meet me in the conference room.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"All Pawnee people, sit at your desks.",6,3
Leslie Knope,And take it personally.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard.",6,3
Leslie Knope,But do not worry.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Mmm!,6,3
Leslie Knope,Sugar mustard.,6,3
Ron Dunn,"That's awful kind of you, Leslie, but I'm afraid those are a little too sweet for me.",6,3
Ron Dunn,I unhooked from that big sugar train over 30 years ago.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"You are a man of principle and I respect that, cool Ron.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"So, what's your story, new Ann?",6,3
Leslie Knope,You're kind of pretty.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're not ""Ann"" pretty, but you have potential.",6,3
Evelyn,"Thank you, but I don't work in this department.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Shut your kind of pretty mouth and, uh, eat a mustard cookie.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's chitchat, huh?",6,3
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other and then become familiar best friends.,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't have time for this.,6,3
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm halfway through designing a bamboo gazebo as a tribute to the founders of Motown.,6,3
Leslie Knope,That's so Craig.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Craig!",6,3
Leslie Knope,"We have fun, don't we?",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Do you guys remember when this all started and I came in here with the cookies, and then Craig said something so Craig and we all laughed, and we were like, ""Craig!""",6,3
Leslie Knope,Do you think it would be weird if we held hands?,6,3
Leslie Knope,Probably.,6,3
Ron Swanson,"This way, please.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Ron, I am talking to my best friends.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Let me go!,6,3
Leslie Knope,"Best friends, attack Ron!",6,3
Chris Traeger,"Ben, it has been an honor watching you work today.",6,3
Chris Traeger,It's been like watching Leonardo work.,6,3
Chris Traeger,Da Vinci or DiCaprio.,6,3
Chris Traeger,You're that good.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, man.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,I was in the zone today.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,This really has been a lot of fun.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,The old juice is back!,6,3
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, should we keep this going?",6,3
Ben Wyatt,"Celebratory dinner, just like the old days?",6,3
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that's a great idea.",6,3
Chris Traeger,"Hey, you know what?",6,3
Chris Traeger,I know who I'm gonna use to calculate tax and tip.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,Me?,6,3
Tynnyfer,Can I just say something?,6,3
Tynnyfer,I'm having so much fun right now.,6,3
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, me too.",6,3
April Ludgate,"Like, so much fun.",6,3
April Ludgate,"Can I just say something, though?",6,3
Tynnyfer,Yeah.,6,3
April Ludgate,Okay.,6,3
April Ludgate,You don't want this job.,6,3
April Ludgate,"Seriously, this place is the pits.",6,3
April Ludgate,"It's like, if you worked here, you'd be like, ""Ugh!""",6,3
April Ludgate,"And Leslie would be like, ""Blah, blah, blah.""",6,3
April Ludgate,"And you'd be like, ""Uh""",6,3
Tynnyfer,"Okay, can I say something?",6,3
Tynnyfer,"Right now, I totally think that you're right, and I had been thinking about going someplace warm while my husband is in jail.",6,3
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!",6,3

Leslie Knope,"Moving, with Chris.",6,3
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's nice.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"Nice, Ron? Edible arrangements are nice.",6,3
Leslie Knope,"This is volcanically hot betrayal! She is my best friend! She's thinking about leaving, just like that!",6,3
Leslie Knope,"And she wants to ""talk to me"" about it? It's like, I don't even know what to say.",6,3
Ron Swanson,"That you love her and you understand that it's her life, and geography will never change your feelings.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Whatever.,6,3
Leslie Knope,I don't even need her.,6,3
Leslie Knope,"I've got Tynnyfer now, and Craig, and Eric, the racist drug dealer who I've yet to meet.",6,3
Leslie Knope,Those are my real friends.,6,3
Ron Swanson,"You can't force friendship, Leslie.",6,3

Chris Traeger,This town is really unhealthy.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I forgot that this part of being accounting bros was actually pretty depressing.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, after the intense, almost meth-like high of solving accounting puzzles, we were always just beat at the end of the day.",6,3
Chris Traeger,I actually think it's something else.,6,3
Chris Traeger,"Back in the day, this was all we had.",6,3
Chris Traeger,"We'd go into a town, we'd fix problems.",6,3
Chris Traeger,We'd go back to some rundown motel.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you'd exercise.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,"I'd re-watch Twin Peaks, then hit the Twin Peaks message boards and read The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer to find Easter Eggs I'd missed.",6,3
Chris Traeger,"But now, Ann and Leslie are our real partners.",6,3
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,It's a good thing.,6,3
Ben Wyatt,But you were a fine surrogate before we found them.,6,3
Chris Traeger,"Just so you know, we're thinking of moving.",6,3
Chris Traeger,Don't know where yet.,6,3
Chris Traeger,"Maybe Michigan, to be with Ann's family.",6,3

Extra,I'm Leslie Knope.,6,4
Extra,Tell your parents to recall me.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 ""Don't"" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers.",6,4
Leslie Knope,"That way, if you see a sign and it says ""Recall Knope,"" all you need to do is add the question mark and the ""Don't,"" and suddenly, it reads, ""Recall Knope? Don't.""",6,4
Donna Meagle,"Why don't you just put the ""Don't"" in front of ""Recall Knope""?",6,4
Leslie Knope,"Yep, that's a much better idea.",6,4
April Ludgate,Can I have these question mark stickers?,6,4
Leslie Knope,Why?,6,4

Leslie Knope,"April, no!",6,4

April Ludgate,Seriously?,6,4
Nadia Stasky,No.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,Why would you even compete in something like that?,6,4
Nadia Stasky,It doesn't matter.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I called earlier about the free vaccinations thing.",6,4

Ben Wyatt,You mind signing it?,6,4
Ron Swanson,That's your will?,6,4
Ron Swanson,"You need that many pages to say, ""Give my stuff to my wife""?",6,4
Ben Wyatt,It's a complicated legal document.,6,4

Ben Wyatt,"""Upon my death, all of my belongings shall transfer to the man or animal who has killed me.""",6,4

Jeremy Jamm,"""The definition of personal.""",6,4
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, we have an issue.",6,4
Chris Traeger,"A tweet has been tweeted from the Parks and Rec Twitter, and I'm afraid it is quite sexually graphic.",6,4
Leslie Knope,It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.,6,4

Chris Traeger,Take a look at this.,6,4
Donna Meagle,"I don't want you to get recalled Knope, but damn, these people know how to pick a neck massager.",6,4
Donna Meagle,"And before you get on my case about those stickers, I already did 'em.",6,4
Chris Traeger,"Donna, there is trouble a-brewin'.",6,4
Leslie Knope,We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.,6,4

Donna Meagle,What'd it say?,6,4
Leslie Knope,"""See you tonight.""",6,4

Leslie Knope,Ew.,6,4
Donna Meagle,"Not to give you too much of a peek into my personal life, but this could have been way worse.",6,4

Donna Meagle,"Ooh, this is bad.",6,4
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna get fired.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"No one is getting fired, okay?",6,4
Leslie Knope,Jamm is trying to use this to hurt me in the recall.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"He's trying to take me down, and he's willing to attack my friends in the process?",6,4
Leslie Knope,No.,6,4
Leslie Knope,No way.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.,6,4
Chris Traeger,Not on her watch.,6,4

Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,4
Chris Traeger,Okay.,6,4
Tom Haverford,"So, why does Doctors Without Borders want to come to Pawnee?",6,4
Nadia Stasky,Pawnee is like a petri dish of weird diseases.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,Did you know you have a higher rate of the West Nile virus than the actual Western Nile?,6,4

April Ludgate,This is amazing.,6,4
Tom Haverford,April.,6,4
April Ludgate,Fine.,6,4

Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he's a lawyer, I'm an accountant.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,We speak the same language.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously, accountants are a little more bad boy, but, uh, there's a respect there.",6,4

Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Trevor.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,"I've been talking to Ron about estate planning, and he is here to do some ""Good Will Hunting.""",6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Because he has to draw up a new will, so",6,4

Trevor Nelson,Thank you.,6,4
Trevor Nelson,"As I've said before, I just don't like puns.",6,4

Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Swanson, let's begin by filling out this form, listing your assets and liabilities.",6,4
Ron Swanson,Nice try.,6,4
Ron Swanson,"I'm not telling you how much money I have, where it's hidden, or which precious metals and/or gemstones it may or may not take the form of.",6,4
Trevor Nelson,"If you don't give me the information I need, there's nothing I can do.",6,4

Trevor Nelson,Check the accountant crap at the door.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, sir, I will.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,Unintentional.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, let's begin.",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,These hearings have two goals.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"One, to find out exactly how this offensive tweet came to be sent.",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"And two, to turn this whole thing into a media circus.",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Knope, do you have a statement?",6,4
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's actually quite simple.",6,4
Leslie Knope,"Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again.",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,Stop stonewalling and tell us what happened here!,6,4
Leslie Knope,I just told you what happened.,6,4
Leslie Knope,It was an unfortunate mistake.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, sadly, due to your ""intracksidence""",6,4
Leslie Knope,Not a word.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,We may never find out what happened.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"When this sick, depraved tweet first came to light, you said, ""The account was probably hacked by some bored teenager.""",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,Now you're saying it's an unfortunate mistake.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,Why do you keep flip-flopping?,6,4
Leslie Knope,"Well, because I learned new information.",6,4
Leslie Knope,"When I was four, I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flip-flopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup.",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,I don't think I'm out of line when I say that this scandal makes Benghazi look like whitewater!,6,4
Leslie Knope,It's utterly meaningless.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,I think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,Perhaps he or she,6,4
Councilman Dexhart,Or them.,6,4
Councilman Dexhart,It could be a bunch of hot ladies.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, perhaps ""them"" can finally give us the answers we need.",6,4
Tom Haverford,"What, what, what?",6,4
Tom Haverford,There she is.,6,4

Tom Haverford,It's gone.,6,4
Tom Haverford,Huh.,6,4

Nadia Stasky,No followup to that?,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"Okay, great.",6,4

Tom Haverford,You were supposed to fill out Form 3248.,6,4

Nadia Stasky,This is to lease a hangar at the airport.,6,4
April Ludgate,I know.,6,4
April Ludgate,"It's so crazy, it almost sounds made up.",6,4

Tom Haverford,What are you gonna do?,6,4

Tom Haverford,"Someone left out a blender, fresh fruits, and rum?",6,4
Tom Haverford,"I guess we gotta, like, make Daiquiris now.",6,4
Tom Haverford,"I like to have music on while I work, you know?",6,4
Nadia Stasky,What is this place?,6,4
Councilman Dexhart,"Ms. Meagle, let me first say that I am a big fan of your writing.",6,4
Donna Meagle,Thank you.,6,4
Councilman Dexhart,It's good stuff.,6,4
Councilman Dexhart,Really good stuff.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"Okay, does anyone else here see a double standard?",6,4
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart is currently being sued by two different women for sexual harassment, one of whom was the judge in the first woman's trial.",6,4
Councilman Dexhart,She was talking dirty to me.,6,4
Leslie Knope,She was reading the emails that you sent to the first woman.,6,4

Typhoon,"Maybe if you had bothered to come to my Great Gatsby Brunch, you'd know.",6,4
Trevor Nelson,I don't even need an exact number.,6,4
Trevor Nelson,Just ballpark it.,6,4
Trevor Nelson,That's all I need to get started.,6,4

Trevor Nelson,Holy [bleep].,6,4

Donna Meagle,"Look, the only reason I'm even on Twitter is to blow off steam about work and tweet nasty stuff to dudes with washboard abs.",6,4
Donna Meagle,"You really think I hate you, after all we've been through the last ten years?",6,4
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know anymore.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, I think we've done a lot of good here today.",6,4
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I am sorry, but I could not postpone these pointless hearings that Jamm is having.",6,4
Chris Traeger,He is just determined.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for trying.",6,4
Leslie Knope,I have a question for you.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm annoying?,6,4
Chris Traeger,No.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Are you lying?,6,4
Chris Traeger,No.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Are you trying to protect my feelings?,6,4
Chris Traeger,No.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm being annoying right now?,6,4
Chris Traeger,Yes.,6,4
Leslie Knope,So you do think I'm annoying.,6,4
Chris Traeger,"I think that you ask a lot of the people that you work with, and I think that people do what you ask because they love you.",6,4
Chris Traeger,"But, I also think that driving people as hard as you do can ruffle some feathers.",6,4
Chris Traeger,I think a lot of things.,6,4
Chris Traeger,I like thinking.,6,4
Chris Traeger,And racquetball.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Now who's annoying?,6,4
Chris Traeger,"I spent the last hour reading some of Donna's old tweets, and it turns out there are some more things that she said about you.",6,4
Chris Traeger,"""Message to the recall haters: You can't keep Leslie Knope down.""",6,4
Chris Traeger,"""She's too real for this ish.""",6,4
Chris Traeger,"""hashtag boss bitch.""",6,4
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope is stepping up at these hearings and taking a bullet for me.""",6,4
Leslie Knope,"""hashtag sister from another mister, hashtag boss bitch.""",6,4
Chris Traeger,"It appears, whereas ""bitch boss"" is clearly an indication of her frustration, ""boss bitch"" is a term of endearment.",6,4
Chris Traeger,Isn't language fun?,6,4
Chris Traeger,It's like racquetball for your mouth!,6,4
April Ludgate,Did you change your outfit?,6,4
Tom Haverford,"I changed five times, and she hasn't noticed yet.",6,4
Tom Haverford,I can only stall for so long.,6,4
Tom Haverford,What should I do?,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I just finished filling this one out.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,"I didn't know what to put for ""Name of commercial airline,"" because I do not operate a commercial airline, so I just made one up.",6,4
Tom Haverford,What did you name your imaginary airline?,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"""Jet Blue Ivy.""",6,4
Nadia Stasky,I figure JayZ and Beyonce's kid will own her own airline eventually.,6,4
Tom Haverford,She's the one.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"So, can I have my permit now?",6,4
Nadia Stasky,Finally?,6,4
Tom Haverford,"Uh, no, there was a mistake, and we gave the park to someone else.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,What?,6,4
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can drive you around and we'll pick another one?,6,4
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll bring a picnic lunch.,6,4
Tom Haverford,Do you like tamales?,6,4
Nadia Stasky,You said that that park was ours.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"You said it a long time ago, in a British accent.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,"I probably shouldn't say this, as a doctor.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,It's probably not cool.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,But I really hope you all get West Nile virus.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"Nice meeting you, April.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,Kind of.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,You're weird too.,6,4
April Ludgate,Thank you.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,We need to talk.,6,4
Ron Swanson,That has never been true.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,I think I know what's happening.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Thinking about how to divide up your possessions for when you die, it's tough, confronting your own mortality, and I think it's got you spinning a little bit.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,Am I right?,6,4
Ron Swanson,Wow.,6,4
Ron Swanson,I had not considered that.,6,4
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I think that maybe you are on to something.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Just know that it's perfectly healthy to be thinking about-- Oh, you're joking.",6,4
Ron Swanson,"Yes, son, I am.",6,4
Ron Swanson,First joke ever.,6,4
Ron Swanson,Don't care for it.,6,4
Ron Swanson,Death does not scare me.,6,4
Ron Swanson,What I am worried about is spoiling my children.,6,4
Ron Swanson,"I don't want 'em to be the kind of people who never work, live off their trust funds, who buy their wooden furniture.",6,4
Ron Swanson,"I will leave my children $50 apiece for the cab home from my funeral and a steak dinner, end of discussion.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look, it doesn't matter how much money you leave your kids.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,What matters is that you teach them the right values.,6,4
Ben Wyatt,"But, if something horrible happens, and you want your kids to be left alone with no safety net, just so they can learn some kind of weird lesson, then, by all means, leave your fortune to the wild boar who gores you to death.",6,4
Ron Swanson,I'd never lose to a boar.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry if I can be little annoying at times, but one person's annoying is another person's inspiring and heroic, so, you know, who are we to judge?",6,4
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry for writing those things.,6,4
Donna Meagle,Some of those things.,6,4
Leslie Knope,I can't promise that I won't be inspiring and heroic in the future.,6,4
Donna Meagle,And I can't promise that I won't complain about it.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Deal.,6,4
Leslie Knope,I got you an apology present.,6,4
Donna Meagle,Oh!,6,4
Leslie Knope,"It is all of your favorite lipsticks and nail polishes, and I got the same ones too.",6,4
Leslie Knope,"I printed out a schedule, so we can wear them at the same time.",6,4
Leslie Knope,"Now, I would like you to open each one in front of me, and tell me how you feel about them individually.",6,4
Donna Meagle,Let me take a picture.,6,4
Leslie Knope,Are you tweeting this?,6,4
Donna Meagle,Mm-hmm.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"What's the hashtag gonna be? ""Boss bitch"" or ""bitch boss""?",6,4
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's ""psycho boss.""",6,4
Leslie Knope,"Eh, I don't hate that.",6,4
Ron Swanson,"Benjamin, after thinking about what you said, I've decided to leave each of my children 5% of my fortune.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, 5 whole percent.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,"So, I guess you are gonna teach them a lesson.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, that's 5%? That is a lot of money.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, is this a joke?",6,4
Trevor Nelson,It is not a joke.,6,4
Trevor Nelson,Not that an accountant would know the difference.,6,4
Ron Swanson,"Also, if something should happen to Diane and me, we decided that the kids should go to the most important people in our lives.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, I'm--I'm incredibly flattered.",6,4
Ron Swanson,Ralph Piatkowski and his wife Helen.,6,4
Ron Swanson,"He's the Maitre D' at Mulligan's Steakhouse, and he knows me better than anyone.",6,4
Ron Swanson,"However, if they are not able to do it, which seems likely, as they're in their 90s, you and Leslie are choice number two.",6,4
Ben Wyatt,I'm honored.,6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"Everyone, take your seats, so this witch hunt may proceed as scheduled.",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"Speaking of, uh, where are the witches?",6,4
Leslie Knope,"They're right here! Well, we're not witches.",6,4
Leslie Knope,That's sexist and offensive.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"But we're right here, and we are not gonna sit in this room and let you drag our names through the mud just to score some cheap political points.",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,How dare you demean the value of the political points I'm scoring?,6,4
Leslie Knope,We have had enough.,6,4
Leslie Knope,"I am going back to work so I can do some good for this town, and my friend Donna is coming with me.",6,4
Donna Meagle,Hmm.,6,4
Donna Meagle,"I prefer ""El Diablo.""",6,4
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, this is not over, Ms. Knope.",6,4
Typhoon,"Donna, quit punishing me! I miss you.",6,4
Donna Meagle,#NAME?,6,4
Donna Meagle,"Or should I say, ""Norman""? Uh-huh.",6,4
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm just gonna man up, tell her how I feel, and hope she feels the same way about me, and that's that.",6,4
Tom Haverford,"If she doesn't, no big deal.",6,4
Tom Haverford,It's done.,6,4
Tom Haverford,I'm an adult.,6,4
Tom Haverford,Let's do it.,6,4
April Ludgate,Great.,6,4
Tom Haverford,"Nope, I can't do it.",6,4
Tom Haverford,New plan.,6,4
Tom Haverford,Tell her all the screw-ups were your fault.,6,4
Tom Haverford,"I'll tell her I had to cover for you, because you are so dumb.",6,4
Tom Haverford,Nadia! We're very sorry for everything you went through today.,6,4
Tom Haverford,I have reserved the park for your event.,6,4
Tom Haverford,"Now, April has something she'd like to admit.",6,4
April Ludgate,"Tom wants me to tell you that all the screw-ups were my fault, but really, he kept messing up so that you would stay in Pawnee as long as possible because he is super into you.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,Okay.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,Several questions.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,Is any part of him British?,6,4
April Ludgate,No.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"So, that was just weird, panicky dude behavior?",6,4
April Ludgate,Yeah.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,Okay.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"I'm just trying to figure out if acting that insane is, like, romantic, or totally scary.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,I'll go with romantic.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,He is kind of cute.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,What's his deal?,6,4
April Ludgate,"He's sweet, he's cool, and you're, like, way out of his league, so there's literally no risk for you at all here.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,Okay.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"Well, I am going to Rwanda in, like, two weeks for my job, so, what the hell?",6,4
April Ludgate,Cool.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,"So, you want to go out with me?",6,4
Tom Haverford,"Yes, please.",6,4
Nadia Stasky,Okay.,6,4
Nadia Stasky,Bye.,6,4
April Ludgate,"Okay, you owe me, like, 1,000 favors.",6,4

Ben Wyatt,I have a thing for women in skates.,6,5
Ben Wyatt,Okay?,6,5
Ben Wyatt,"Everyone has a thing, and that's mine.",6,5

April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, Ann called.",6,5
April Ludgate,She wants her ugly outfit back.,6,5

Ron Swanson,Ugh!,6,5
Donna Meagle,"Get it together, Swanson.",6,5

Tom Haverford,You know snitches get stitches.,6,5
Leslie Knope,I remember the first time I voted.,6,5
Leslie Knope,"I was in my bedroom, and I was five.",6,5

Donna Meagle,That you happen to suck at.,6,5
Ron Swanson,You know what?,6,5
Ron Swanson,That's a good point.,6,5
Donna Meagle,What?,6,5

Annabel Porter,"You know, I'm not perfect.",6,6
Joan Callamezzo,Oh.,6,6
Annabel Porter,The average woman worries about what she looks like in a bathing suit.,6,6
Annabel Porter,So does my nanny.,6,6
Annabel Porter,So I get it.,6,6
Joan Callamezzo,"Annabel, what trends are Pardon the pun, but Trending?",6,6
Annabel Porter,"First of all, Mozambique cashmere is the new cast-iron stove.",6,6

Annabel Porter,"I have found some amazing new conflict free paella recipes, and, luckily, my favorite fishmonger now makes house calls.",6,6

Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on in.",6,6
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the den of horrors.,6,6
Extra,Where's all the scary stuff?,6,6
Leslie Knope,"Scary stuff is invisible, Leah. Broken dreams, disappointment, achieving your greatest goal and having it all fall apart and knowing that you'll never climb any higher.",6,6
Extra,Can we have some candy?,6,6
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna give you something sweeter than candy, Ryan. The truth.",6,6
Leslie Knope,It's very possible that some of you have already peaked.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"It's all downhill from here, turkeys.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's say goodbye to Ms. Knope, kids.",6,6
Leslie Knope,It is Ms. Knope.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"It's not city councilwoman Knope, because that chapter of my life is already over.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, kids, nothing gold can stay.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,6,6
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, my goodness, we are back with America's greatest leader Annabel Porter and her new favorite artisan, local woodworker Ron Swanson.",6,6
Ron Swanson,Hello.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"I discovered Ron's chairs a few months ago, and what I absolutely love about a Swanson is you can really use it for anything.",6,6
Ron Swanson,"Yes, mostly you use it for sitting.",6,6
Annabel Porter,Make it a rustic accent piece in your solarium.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"Even better, use it as a focal point in your yoga tent.",6,6
Ron Swanson,Put it by a table and eat a meal.,6,6
Annabel Porter,We don't do meals in my home.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"No, every two hours, we eat what I like to call a food tease, like an oat wedge or a seaweed lozenge.",6,6
Joan Callamezzo,"Can I just say-- And I think this is really important, so I need everyone to shut up-- I love your hair.",6,6
Annabel Porter,Oh.,6,6
Annabel Porter,Thank you.,6,6
Annabel Porter,It's genetic and unattainable.,6,6
Chris Traeger,I am scaring you!,6,6
April Ludgate,I could see you.,6,6
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a million mirrors in front of me.",6,6
April Ludgate,"And you're never gonna make me not miss Andy, okay?",6,6
Chris Traeger,What about this?,6,6
Chris Traeger,"I'm Bert Macklin, friendly lifeguard.",6,6
April Ludgate,Bert Macklin is not a lifeguard.,6,6
April Ludgate,He's an FBI agent.,6,6
Chris Traeger,Really?,6,6
Chris Traeger,That's even harder to believe.,6,6
April Ludgate,"Just stop, okay?",6,6
April Ludgate,Your lame attempts at trying to cheer me up are not working.,6,6
April Ludgate,Now I'm sad that I miss Andy and sad that I can't make fun of you to Andy.,6,6
Chris Traeger,I understand.,6,6
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.,6,6
Chris Traeger,"I've failed you, both as a scary monster and a friend.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I am really sorry.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,I know you must feel awful.,6,6
Leslie Knope,I don't feel awful.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"You know, actually, I feel like I can finally relax.",6,6
Leslie Knope,Accepting that you've peaked is very freeing.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I know the feeling.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,"I was impeached when I was 18, and it was brutal.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,But you just have to keep climbing back up that hill.,6,6
Leslie Knope,Or do you?,6,6
Leslie Knope,"Maybe instead of working super hard to rebuild your life, you just said, ""I peaked.""",6,6
Leslie Knope,Wow.,6,6
Leslie Knope,What a great run.,6,6
Leslie Knope,And now I'm going to spend the rest of my life really chill.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure, I mean, part of that sounds very appealing.",6,6
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,"But, no.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, see, iit was important for me-- See, I took a job in City budget crisis management, and now I work for a candy charity.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, did I peak when I was 18?",6,6
Leslie Knope,There it is.,6,6
Leslie Knope,Drink up.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,Whoo!,6,6

Ron Swanson,"Well, I make two a year, so maybe in six years.",6,6
Extra,Can you put me on the wait list?,6,6
Extra,Me too Unless your chair was ever touched by someone who ate refined sugar.,6,6
Extra,"Then I can't buy any of your chairs, and I protest this entire event.",6,6
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Ron, Annabels coming over.",6,6
Tom Haverford,"When you talk me up, be sure to mention that you really admire how I take big risks with men's neck accessories.",6,6
Annabel Porter,There he is.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"Hello, hello.",6,6
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for your kind words about my chairs, Miss Porter.",6,6
Annabel Porter,"No, thank us.",6,6
Annabel Porter,You are about to make a ton of money.,6,6
Annabel Porter,I want to license your designs.,6,6
Annabel Porter,We are going to put Swanson chairs in every six bedroom home in the Midwest.,6,6
Ron Swanson,"If my chairs were mass produced, they wouldn't be Swanson chairs.",6,6
Ron Swanson,Swanson chairs are handmade.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"Yes, and now they will be made by thousands of tiny Chinese hands.",6,6
Ron Swanson,"Oh, Miss Porter, this is my very good friend Tom Haverford.",6,6
Ron Swanson,He's a big fan of your... Whatever you call what you do.,6,6
Ron Swanson,Please speak to each other while I leave.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"Oh, no, I am not done with you, you wicked little so-and-so.",6,6
Ron Swanson,Terrific.,6,6
Leslie Knope,You know what?,6,6
Leslie Knope,"I had my time, you know?",6,6
Leslie Knope,I did my thing.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"I wanted to be a city councilor, and I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!",6,6
Leslie Knope,"And the people were like, pffft!",6,6
Ben Wyatt,At least we have each other.,6,6
Leslie Knope,I love you so much.,6,6

Ben Wyatt,I did.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,I was there.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"We may have peaked, but it doesn't matter.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"We need to do something big, you know, something that really lets people know that we're gonna love each other forever.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!,6,6
Ben Wyatt,What is it?,6,6
Leslie Knope,I got it.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, sir.",6,6

Ben Wyatt,This is the idea of the century.,6,6
Leslie Knope,Right here.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,Come here.,6,6
Tom Haverford,My store is called RentaSwag.,6,6
Tom Haverford,It's a clothing rental service for teens.,6,6
Annabel Porter,It's an interesting idea.,6,6
Annabel Porter,Are you guys doing well?,6,6
Tom Haverford,We're doing amazing.,6,6
Annabel Porter,Mm.,6,6
Tom Haverford,And it'd be perfect for Bloosh.,6,6
Ron Swanson,Why don't you take out whatever you wrote about my chairs and put something in about RentaSwag instead?,6,6
Annabel Porter,This month's trends are final.,6,6
Annabel Porter,I can't just throw a trend out.,6,6
Annabel Porter,But my Bloosh scouts have started trendtracking for the February zine blast.,6,6
Ron Swanson,"Good God, these words.",6,6
Annabel Porter,I'll have them stop by your store.,6,6
Tom Haverford,That'll be too late.,6,6
Tom Haverford,We'll be out of business by then.,6,6
Annabel Porter,I thought you said you were doing well.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"Ronnie, one last time, have you reconsidered mass production?",6,6
Annabel Porter,I can sell your chairs on my site.,6,6
Ron Swanson,"No, thank you, ma'am.",6,6
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in letting someone else sell my work.,6,6
Annabel Porter,"Well, that's too bad.",6,6
Annabel Porter,This party is over.,6,6
Annabel Porter,It no longer is.,6,6
Annabel Porter,It was.,6,6
Tom Haverford,It was?,6,6
Tom Haverford,That was my last shot.,6,6
Donna Meagle,"Sorry, Tommy.",6,6
Donna Meagle,Let's just grab some of that lychee body oil and bounce.,6,6
Tom Haverford,Can you grab me some of those pomegranate face masks too?,6,6
Donna Meagle,Fo' sho'.,6,6
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question?,6,6
Leslie Knope,Are we the cutest couple you've ever seen?,6,6
Herman,Nope.,6,6
Herman,"Okay, you want the long needle or the short needle?",6,6
Herman,Doesn't matter.,6,6
Herman,Can't find a short needle.,6,6
Herman,Long needle it is.,6,6
Leslie Knope,I have a big idea.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"I want a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, tastefully done, and then she has a very classy tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm.",6,6
Leslie Knope,And that's very subtle.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"No, scratch that.",6,6
Leslie Knope,Scratch all that.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"Just write ""Ben"".",6,6
Ben Wyatt,Do you have anything to numb the pain?,6,6
Herman,"Sure, take a scoop out of the pill bucket.",6,6
Herman,"Okay, you said you wanted ""mouth queen""?",6,6
Ann Perkins,"No, stop.",6,6
Ann Perkins,Stop it.,6,6
Ann Perkins,Stop everything that you're doing.,6,6
Ann Perkins,Stop it.,6,6
Leslie Knope,Ann's here!,6,6

Ann Perkins,Ann does not want a tattoo.,6,6
Ann Perkins,No one wants a tattoo.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"Ann, relax.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"Be ""respitable"" for a second, okay?",6,6
Leslie Knope,What we are doing is not nuts.,6,6
Leslie Knope,We are merely getting tattoos so that everybody knows we love each other and that we haven't peaked.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,It makes a lot of sense.,6,6
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we're leaving, all right?",6,6
Ann Perkins,So say goodbye to the nice man and thank me for saving you from being on Dateline.,6,6
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's go.",6,6

Tom Haverford,"I don't want to be a failure again, Ron.",6,6
Ron Swanson,There's no shame in failure if you gave it an honest effort.,6,6
Tom Haverford,Easy for you to say.,6,6
Tom Haverford,"People are dying to give you money for your business, and you didn't even take it.",6,6
Ron Swanson,I didn't sell my chairs to that website because I value my name.,6,6
Ron Swanson,The only thing that's important at the end of the day is what's on your gravestone-- Your name.,6,6
Tom Haverford,My gravestone's gonna be a 60-inch touchscreen with a hologram of four mes singing End of the Road by Boyz II Men But point taken.,6,6
Ann Perkins,"Ben, what is the first rule of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force?",6,6
Ben Wyatt,Don't let her get a tattoo.,6,6
Ann Perkins,What the hell happened?,6,6
Ben Wyatt,I couldn't help it.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,She's so cute when she's coming up with destructive ideas.,6,6

Ann Perkins,"Ben and I tried to help you, but as usual, you're the best person for the job.",6,6
Ann Perkins,I wrote this. You need to hear yourself read this.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"""They held the recall election, and I lost.""",6,6
Leslie Knope,"""I was voted out of office.""",6,6
Leslie Knope,"""In 30 days, I will no longer be a Pawnee city councilor.""",6,6

Leslie Knope,"""I am more than a city councilor.""",6,6
Leslie Knope,"""I am an unstoppable force of energy.""",6,6

Ann Perkins,"These are all your ongoing projects, everything you're currently working on for Pawnee.",6,6
Ann Perkins,You have things to do.,6,6
Ann Perkins,You have a month left.,6,6
Ann Perkins,Use it.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you poetic and noble land mermaid, you're right once again.",6,6
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,I flushed my car keys down the toilet.,6,6
Leslie Knope,No problem.,6,6
April Ludgate,Eww stop.,6,6
Ann Perkins,"Hello to you too, April.",6,6
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry I said you were lame, okay? You are, but I know you were just trying to help me, so",6,6

Chris Traeger,Happy Halloween.,6,6
Chris Traeger,"And if you want to egg Larry's house, come find me.",6,6
April Ludgate,You guys are cute.,6,6
Ann Perkins,Where'd that come from?,6,6
April Ludgate,I'm weak.,6,6
April Ludgate,"I miss Andy, and it's making me weak.",6,6
April Ludgate,"Also, if Chris puts that much effort into making my stupid night better, I'm sure that he'll make your lame life perfect.",6,6
April Ludgate,Or he's secretly super in love with me.,6,6
April Ludgate,It's probably that.,6,6
Chris Traeger,"That's a funny joke, April.",6,6
Chris Traeger,"But the truth is, I'm very much in love with Ann.",6,6
April Ludgate,"Okay, gross.",6,6
April Ludgate,The spell's broken.,6,6
Tom Haverford,"I've made my decision, and I'll sell you Rent-a-Swag, but on my terms.",6,6
Trevor Nelson,Which are?,6,6
Tom Haverford,"40,000 for the inventory, the website, and everything else in the store, but I keep the name Rent-a-Swag.",6,6
Tom Haverford,"It's mine, and I'm keeping it.",6,6
Trevor Nelson,The name is actually an important part of the sale.,6,6
Tom Haverford,Really?,6,6
Trevor Nelson,Yes.,6,6
Trevor Nelson,My client likes the name.,6,6
Trevor Nelson,It's better than Tommy's Closet.,6,6
Trevor Nelson,He needs the name.,6,6
Tom Haverford,"Well, I don't know what to tell you, except I'll throw in the name in exchange for 20,000 more and 5% of your client's business.",6,6
Trevor Nelson,"I'll run it past my client, but I think we have a deal.",6,6
Tom Haverford,"Ron said there's nothing more valuable than my name, but he's not a businessman.",6,6
Tom Haverford,I am.,6,6
Tom Haverford,And now I have seed money for my next venture.,6,6
Tom Haverford,"I sold out, baby.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"The votes have been counted, and I have been recalled.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"I am, of course, disappointed.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"But I am still your City councilwoman for 30 more days, and I intend to spend every second I have left working for you and this great city.",6,6
Ben Wyatt,The thing about being part of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force is that it's a very easy job.,6,6
Ben Wyatt,She's never down for that long.,6,6
Ann Perkins,"And now that she's had a little time to recharge, she is like a toddler bouncing back from a nap.",6,6
Leslie Knope,Hey! There you guys are.,6,6
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, I need some help with the re-zoning thing.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"Also, I think we should paint our deck, so I have some color samples for you.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"And to thank you both for being there when I needed you, I carved your faces into these Jack-o-lanterns.",6,6
Leslie Knope,"Ann, it was very hard to capture your beauty, and, Ben, you make a sexy pumpkin",6,6
Leslie Knope,No surprise.,6,6

Leslie Knope,"Check it out, Tom-- the Eagleton reservoir.",6,7
Leslie Knope,Isn't it stunning?,6,7
Tom Haverford,It's just a big dumb pond.,6,7
Tom Haverford,This morning I saw a YouTube clip of a little puppy riding a motorcycle.,6,7
Tom Haverford,"So my bar for ""stunning"" is pretty high.",6,7
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that this water has fluoride in it?,6,7
Tom Haverford,Then I would tell you the puppy had a little side car with a piggy in it named Hampton.,6,7
Leslie Knope,"First of all, send me a link to that video.",6,7
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, now that we have access to the Eagleton reservoir and the water treatment supply, Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history.",6,7
Leslie Knope,Nailed it.,6,7

Ron Swanson,"Several months ago, I was on a walk and found my crib tree.",6,7
Ron Swanson,"I approached the tree, murdered it, left it to cure in my woodshop, and have begun working it into a crib for my upcoming child.",6,7
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, you cannot use this crib.",6,7
Chris Traeger,You're ignoring every known crib safety standard.,6,7
Chris Traeger,It's all covered in the parenting book I'm reading.,6,7
Chris Traeger,Are you going to crawl my way?,6,7
Chris Traeger,By Lenny Kravitz.,6,7
Ron Swanson,My crib will be safe because I'm building it with my own two hands.,6,7

Jeremy Jamm,We're just goosing our water supply with fluoride?,6,7
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, come on.",6,7
Jeremy Jamm,Are we really gonna force every Pawnee resident to ingest a chemical we know nothing about?,6,7
Councilman Milton,Fluoride is used by the communists to control our minds.,6,7
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not.",6,7
Councilman Dexhart,Fluoride can control minds?,6,7
Councilman Dexhart,"Like, you can use it to make ladies do stuff?",6,7
Leslie Knope,How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?,6,7
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it.",6,7
Jeremy Jamm,"Ah, all right.",6,7
Jeremy Jamm,You got me.,6,7
Jeremy Jamm,"I don't want fluoride in the water because I'm a dentist, and I like cavities.",6,7
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that is not a valid reason.",6,7
Jeremy Jamm,"Pawnee's cavity problem is why a small town dentist, like me, can afford such a boss ride.",6,7
Jeremy Jamm,Got an Asian girl to sit in it once.,6,7
Leslie Knope,Why did we come out here?,6,7
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Jamm.",6,7
Leslie Knope,Fluoride in the water it's a no-brainer.,6,7
Leslie Knope,Can't you just let me have this one?,6,7

Leslie Knope,"Jamm's not going to be able to kill this reservoir merger, is he?",6,7

Ron Swanson,Nah.,6,7

Ben Wyatt,"I mean, if you apologize, it'll be an endorsement - for the Drink-ems plan.",6,7

Ben Wyatt,And everything you said about Sweetums was right on.,6,7
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, 90% of the charity work I did was to compensate for messes they caused.",6,7

Leslie Knope,I have several binders with very important data that I need to get through.,6,7
Tom Haverford,"Well, miss, I think we'd all appreciate it if you just swallowed a teaspoon of hush.",6,7

Chris Traeger,It's beautiful.,6,7
Chris Traeger,Thank you.,6,7
Ron Swanson,"Nobody has all the right answers in parenting, including me.",6,7
Ron Swanson,And that toxic crib you bought won't be the last mistake you make.,6,7
Ron Swanson,But a man who's this worried about making all the right choices cares very much.,6,7

Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Because in that picture, she's wearing a bikini.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, thanks.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Photoshopped it myself.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Fantastic.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this is about the time I hit the hay, so",6,8
Leslie Knope,Why don't we all hit the hay?,6,8
Leslie Knope,"We'll stay here, get a good night's sleep, and we can start negotiations tomorrow.",6,8
Leslie Knope,We stopped at the outlet mall on the way here.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Got ourselves a sleeping bag, a giant tin of caramel corn, and an irregular skirt from DKNY.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"The hem is crooked, but it was 8 bucks.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"The point is, I am not leaving until I get that lockbox.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, playing hardball, huh?",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, no sweat off my sack.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"You can take the couch, if you can get my exercise equipment out of the way.",6,8
Leslie Knope,I think I can handle it.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"How sweet is this table, by the way, huh?",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,I got it from an actual benihana.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Cost me 4 grand.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Worth every penny.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Can I interest anyone in an authentic Japanese abreakafast?,6,8
Leslie Knope,Scrambled eggs eaten with chopsticks?,6,8
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!,6,8
Leslie Knope,"You know, maybe we should negotiate while we're eating.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"No, what's the rush?",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Plenty of time for that later.,6,8
Leslie Knope,You know what might put you in the mood to talk is a couple of brewskis and a calendar featuring some of your favorite female wrestlers.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Knope, you know the way to a man's heart.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, okay.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Let's talk.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,You got it.,6,8
Ron Swanson,These people won't leave.,6,8
Ron Swanson,One guy even looked in the bathroom.,6,8
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, that means they like the place.",6,8
Donna Meagle,"If you just leave them alone, I think we might get some offers.",6,8
Tom Haverford,This evergreen scented candle should help put people in the mood to buy.,6,8
Ron Swanson,You could just open the door and let the actual smell of the pines in.,6,8
Tom Haverford,"Trees are sticky, and they got bugs in them.",6,8
Extra,This place is so random.,6,8
Extra,I don't know.,6,8
Extra,"It's kind of, like, in the middle of nowhere.",6,8
April Ludgate,I know.,6,8
April Ludgate,"That's, like, the hilarious part.",6,8
April Ludgate,It's like a joke how long it takes to get here.,6,8
April Ludgate,It's like a meta-cabin.,6,8
Extra,Oh yeah.,6,8
Extra,"That's what I thought, yeah.",6,8
April Ludgate,I heard that Dave Eggers wrote a short story about this tape cassette that he found under that tree over there.,6,8
Extra,"Oh, my God.",6,8
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?,6,8
April Ludgate,I'm trying to get these annoying dumdums to pay more money for your cabin.,6,8
Ron Swanson,Carry on.,6,8
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I heard that Neko Case and Ben Gibbard made out here once.",6,8
Extra,What?,6,8
Barney,Saturday at the firm with Ben.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we dissolve the loanout and file bankruptcy.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,That way only our clients have claim to the assets.,6,8
Frank,Great idea that we had a month ago.,6,8
Frank,"The problem is, the trust still has claim to the property.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,Then we dissolve the trust.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Clients ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""F,"" they would have to agree, but if they went for it, we could arbitrate.",6,8
Frank,He's right.,6,8
Frank,We never thought of that.,6,8
Barney,"Oh, oh!",6,8
Barney,"Ben, Ben.",6,8
Barney,"Say it again but this time I'm gonna turn the light on, like you just had an idea.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Sure, sure.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I'm with you.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Um, okay.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,What if we dissolve the trust?,6,8
Barney,Yes!,6,8
Barney,You just cracked the case.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,I'm just doing my job.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we name part of the park the ""Jamm Zone""?",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, Jamm could dig on that.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"How about if in the Jamm zone, there's no married chicks allowed?",6,8
Chris Traeger,"Caution, Jeremy.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"I think there are people that will find the ""No Married Chicks"" zone both morally repugnant and hard to enforce.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,All right.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Listen, let us celebrate this progress by sharing these authentic edamame, or Tokyo beans.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Now I want you to be very careful about eating these.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"You eat the shells, and you throw the seeds out.",6,8
Leslie Knope,Wow.,6,8
Leslie Knope,You have really immersed yourself in Asian culture.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Now I think maybe we should revisit the holding bond idea.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Ugh, Lezzie.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Come on, I'm getting bored.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, we've been at this for hours.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Can we please take a break?,6,8
Chris Traeger,Perhaps he has a point.,6,8
Chris Traeger,And we've made some progress.,6,8
Chris Traeger,Maybe we go home and take the rest of it up on Monday.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait until Monday.",6,8
Leslie Knope,I need to close this deal now.,6,8
Leslie Knope,So I have an idea.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Let's have a change of venue and keep negotiating while we have fun.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"If I remember correctly, you enjoy the ancient art of karaoke, yes?",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,I do.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,And kudos on that pronunciation.,6,8
Leslie Knope,I remembered your favorite duet.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time to take this party to Rydell High.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!,6,8
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to hear your Travolta.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, no, no, no.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,I'm Sandra Dee.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,That's more of my register.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,You're Zuko.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"He got friendly, holdin' my hand",6,8
Leslie Knope,She got friendly down in the sand,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"He was sweet, just turned 18",6,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, she was good, you know what I mean?",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights",6,8
Leslie Knope,"Uh summer heat boy and girl meet but ah, oh, those summer nights",6,8
Chris Traeger,I would like to buy five DVDs of this.,6,8
Chris Traeger,"No, 20.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"No, 60!",6,8
Chris Traeger,"No, that's insane.",6,8
Leslie Knope,Dubee doo dubee doo dubee dubee dubee dow,6,8
Tom Haverford,Good news.,6,8
Tom Haverford,We have multiple bidders.,6,8
Tom Haverford,That guy's getting his financials together.,6,8
Tom Haverford,"Plans on tearing the whole place down, just wants it for the land.",6,8
Ron Swanson,Why would he want to tear down a perfectly good cabin?,6,8
Donna Meagle,"I think he's a developer, wants to put in a luxury glampground.",6,8
Donna Meagle,"Glamping is ""glamour camping.""",6,8
Donna Meagle,"Heated tents, catered meals, wifi",6,8
Ron Swanson,You're describing a hotel.,6,8
Tom Haverford,And I think we still have traction with those two.,6,8
Extra,"Oh, hey, man.",6,8
Extra,I love the mustache.,6,8
Extra,So funny.,6,8
Extra,"You ever think about twisting it up at the ends, huh?",6,8
Extra,Use a little beeswax?,6,8
Ron Swanson,The open house is now closed.,6,8
Ron Swanson,We are not accepting bids at this time.,6,8
Ron Swanson,The sun sets in 95 minutes.,6,8
Ron Swanson,Good day.,6,8
Tom Haverford,That's part of the charm of this whole place-- the cantankerous old coot who owns it.,6,8
Tom Haverford,It's authentic!,6,8
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, that was pretty fun up there.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"We have fun when we collaborate, right?",6,8
Leslie Knope,Working together?,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Lockbox, right?",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"You know, in some weird, perverted, sexual way, I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.",6,8
Leslie Knope,Oh.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,You are my Nemesis.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,You're the Superman to my Lex Luthor.,6,8
Leslie Knope,You want to be Lex Luthor?,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, yeah.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Lex Luthor is rich.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, okay.",6,8
Leslie Knope,I can't argue with that.,6,8
Leslie Knope,So I did Zuko for you.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Now you give me the lockbox.,6,8
Chris Traeger,"Leslie put a beautiful cross into the box, Jeremy.",6,8
Chris Traeger,Time for you to head it in.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, Knope.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,What can I say?,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,You wore me down.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"I will give you my word, and I will put it in writing, so I can't back out.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,We won't touch the money for one year.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"And if the economy holds up, you can start construction then.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have your lockbox.",6,8
Chris Traeger,And you scored a triple dragon on your song.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait a year.",6,8
Leslie Knope,I want to get started now.,6,8
Leslie Knope,I want construction started on Monday.,6,8
Chris Traeger,You have his word.,6,8
Chris Traeger,"And this is riddled with spelling errors, but it is binding.",6,8
Leslie Knope,It's not good enough!,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I sang your stupid song, I ate your stupid fake Asian food, and by the way, you should know, you don't make sushi rolls out of tuna salad",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe you don't.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"I did practically everything you wanted, and you won't just give this to me today?",6,8
Leslie Knope,Screw you!,6,8
Leslie Knope,You're giving a card to me?,6,8
Chris Traeger,You left me no choice.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!",6,8
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!",6,8
Chris Traeger,"Please, could you excuse us?",6,8
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you should be happy!",6,8
Chris Traeger,You beat Jamm in the final battle.,6,8
Chris Traeger,Unless there's something more going on here.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Ann.,6,8
Leslie Knope,This is about Ann.,6,8
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins?,6,8
Chris Traeger,I love Ann Perkins.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Commons is why I met Ann five years ago.,6,8
Leslie Knope,And I know you guys are talking about moving.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"But I guess I thought if maybe Ann came back from Michigan tomorrow, and I was able to look into her smoky, ethnically ambiguous eyes and tell her that we were breaking ground on a new park, she might... she might want to stay.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I'm sorry.",6,8
Chris Traeger,Ann didn't just go to Ann arbor to visit family.,6,8
Chris Traeger,She went to sign the lease on our new home.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Ann arbor sounds disgusting.,6,8
Chris Traeger,She already has family there.,6,8
Chris Traeger,And I have a new job lined up at the University of Michigan.,6,8
Chris Traeger,Go blue!,6,8
Chris Traeger,It's a good town.,6,8
Chris Traeger,And it's a great place to raise a family.,6,8
Leslie Knope,What is great about it?,6,8
Leslie Knope,There's no JJ's Diner there.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"There's no ""Welcome to Pawnee"" sign.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the stupid state is split up into two pieces!",6,8
Leslie Knope,It's ridiculous.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Unexpected play here, Superman.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Not exactly sure what you're going for, but I dig your Gambit.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"There is no Gambit here, Jamm.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"And who sides with Lex Luthor, by the way?",6,8
Leslie Knope,You probably watch Million Dollar Baby and root for the stool.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,I haven't seen it.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,I find his voice very grating.,6,8
Leslie Knope,I am leaving now.,6,8
Leslie Knope,I am not moving.,6,8
Leslie Knope,I'm just going home.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Are you guys coming back to my place?,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,What's what's or are you guys going back to... we wrapping up the weekend?,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,No?,6,8
Ben Wyatt,Need a cup to perk me up coffee in the morning,6,8
All,Surprise!,6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!",6,8
Barney,I hope you don't mind.,6,8
Barney,We decided to throw you a pizza party to say congrats for cracking the case.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, you guys.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,See what we got here.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,That's not pizza.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,Those are calzones!,6,8
Ben Wyatt,I love calzones!,6,8
Barney,We know!,6,8
Ben Wyatt,I think it's safe to say I made the right choice.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,"What's up, guys?",6,8
All,Hey!,6,8
Chris Traeger,BFF slideshow?,6,8
Chris Traeger,"You know that even after we leave Pawnee, Ann will always be your best friend.",6,8
Chris Traeger,And it's not that long a trip.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, it would be even faster if the governor would return my calls about my Pawnee to Ann arbor bullet train idea.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"You know, I went to Jamm's with you because I also want to leave the right kind of legacy, and that includes Pawnee commons.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think I burned that bridge with Jamm.",6,8
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna get that lockbox.,6,8
Leslie Knope,And I am not singing Beauty School Dropout.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"It's sexist, and I don't do slow jams.",6,8
Chris Traeger,I have an idea.,6,8
Chris Traeger,And I'd like you to consider it a good-bye gift from me to you.,6,8
Donna Meagle,"No, thank you.",6,8
Donna Meagle,I will let him know.,6,8
Donna Meagle,That was that couple you liked at the open house.,6,8
Ron Swanson,I despised them.,6,8
Donna Meagle,"Well, they just came back with a new offer and jacked that shizz up.",6,8
Donna Meagle,Way over asking price.,6,8
Tom Haverford,"Ron, who cares who they are? That's a massive bid.",6,8
Tom Haverford,I'ma be a mogul.,6,8
Ron Swanson,I bought that cabin 18 years go for 2000 dollars. I do not care about the money.,6,8
Tom Haverford,I can't even understand what you're saying right now.,6,8
Ron Swanson,"That cabin served an important purpose for me, as a quiet refuge from the nonsense of modern life.",6,8
Ron Swanson,I'd like the next owners to understand and share that purpose.,6,8
Ron Swanson,"Find me someone like that, and I'll happily sell.",6,8
April Ludgate,I'll buy it.,6,8
Tom Haverford,You can't afford that house.,6,8
Tom Haverford,Can you afford that house?,6,8
Ron Swanson,What would you use it for?,6,8
April Ludgate,I'd go up there and take Andy and Champion and just get away from everyone else and look at spiders.,6,8
April Ludgate,And it's where I'd bury the bodies of that annoying couple after I murder them.,6,8
April Ludgate,Here's my offer.,6,8
April Ludgate,I will give you everything in my purse.,6,8
April Ludgate,"8 dollars, a bunch of loose cough drops, and Larry's asthma inhaler.",6,8
Jerry Gergich,Thank God.,6,8
Jerry Gergich,I've been looking for that.,6,8
April Ludgate,"Larry, this is part of a real estate transaction now.",6,8
April Ludgate,You have no legal claim to it.,6,8
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, I had no idea.",6,8
Ron Swanson,This is the best offer I've heard yet.,6,8
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you tripping right now.",6,8
Ron Swanson,Sold.,6,8
Donna Meagle,Don't even trip.,6,8
Ron Swanson,Your commission.,6,8
Donna Meagle,Thanks a lot.,6,8
Donna Meagle,"Your share, mogul.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm about to play golf with a guy who was almost on The Apprentice, so this better be good.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"You give Leslie her lockbox, and you get me in your hip pocket.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"Starting in my next term as city manager, I will give you one huge I.O.U., no questions asked.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm likes the sound of that.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's make it five I.O.U.s, and you got a deal.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"You drive a hard bargain, but you leave me no choice.",6,8
Chris Traeger,Fine.,6,8
Chris Traeger,Five huge IOUs.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Deal, guys.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,You must really want that park.,6,8
Leslie Knope,I do.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Yes.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"And to tell you the truth, I'm doing it all for my best friend.",6,8
Jeremy Jamm,That's all I wanted to hear.,6,8
Jeremy Jamm,"Leslie, you're my best friend too.",6,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, vote passed.",6,8
Leslie Knope,3-2.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Jamm is gonna be so pissed when he finds out that you're leaving and your I.O.U.s are worthless.,6,8
Leslie Knope,Are you sure you're okay with what you did?,6,8
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's not the most ethical thing that I've ever done, but on the flip side, Jamm is a big, mean dope.",6,8
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.,6,8
Chris Traeger,And I hope that this eases some of the pain of us moving away a little bit.,6,8
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm currently in deep denial that that's happening.",6,8
Chris Traeger,"Speaking of which, how's the new gig coming?",6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I got a raise, and my fridge is full of calzones, so not complaining.",6,8
Chris Traeger,The reason I ask is this town is gonna need a new city manager.,6,8
Chris Traeger,"And I've talked to some people, and you have the votes if you want the job.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,Wh-- Seriously?,6,8
Leslie Knope,Is this for realskis?,6,8
Chris Traeger,This is 100% certified for realskis.,6,8
Chris Traeger,#NAME?,6,8
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I-- wow.",6,8
Ben Wyatt,I would be insane to say no.,6,8
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no.",6,8
Barney,"Wyatt, you're late.",6,8

Leslie Knope,"I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement.",6,10
Leslie Knope,So pressure's off.,6,10
Tom Haverford,What?,6,10
Tom Haverford,I spent a lot of time on this.,6,10
Leslie Knope,"Doin' what, putting mousse in your hair?",6,10
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based serum.,6,10
Tom Haverford,"Second of all, who uses mousse still?",6,10
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God.",6,10
Tom Haverford,Leslie.,6,10
Tom Haverford,Let's put our differences aside for a second.,6,10
Tom Haverford,"Friend to friend, do you still use mousse?",6,10
Leslie Knope,"No, I use the juicy space thing-- whatever you do.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom.",6,10
Tom Haverford,Stu's sales are flat.,6,10
Tom Haverford,Lemonade's the future.,6,10
Tom Haverford,I'm still doing my presentation.,6,10
Leslie Knope,"I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes.",6,10
Tom Haverford,Fine.,6,10
Leslie Knope,Fine.,6,10
Ron Swanson,Yeah.,6,10
Ron Swanson,I didn't think so.,6,10
Chris Traeger,"On the other hand, there are some benefits to being married: Taxes, health insurance, and I don't have to feel weird when hotel employees call me ""Mr. Perkins.""",6,10
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that makes me feel weird too.",6,10
Ann Perkins,Maybe we should.,6,10
Ann Perkins,"I don't know anymore.""",6,10
Chris Traeger,"""Maybe we should.""",6,10
Chris Traeger,"""I don't know anymore.""",6,10

Theodore,Okay.,6,10
Theodore,Ring's yours again.,6,10
Theodore,Hello?,6,10
Chris Traeger,"Actually, we don't want the ring.",6,10
Theodore,Unbelievable.,6,10
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, look.",6,10
Ron Swanson,"I'm the last person to want to deprive the world of more stew, but are you sure you wanna do this?",6,10
Leslie Knope,"Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up.",6,10
Leslie Knope,Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?,6,10
Leslie Knope,The botched laser show?,6,10
Leslie Knope,Larry still can't see purple.,6,10
Ron Swanson,That was Larry's fault.,6,10
Ron Swanson,He picked up the laser and stared right into it.,6,10
Leslie Knope,"I know, but still, Tom is all flash and no substance.",6,10
Ron Swanson,That's the old Tom.,6,10
Ron Swanson,"You've been gone for a while, Leslie.",6,10
Ron Swanson,Tom has changed.,6,10
Ron Swanson,"He ran a business, sold it for a profit.",6,10
Ron Swanson,"He's also been working here for six years, and he's learned a lot from you.",6,10
Ron Swanson,"At some point, you're gonna have to trust him to do his job.",6,10
Andy Dwyer,You guys.,6,10
Andy Dwyer,You guys.,6,10
Andy Dwyer,Be cool.,6,10
April Ludgate,What's going on?,6,10
Andy Dwyer,"I kind of convinced Ben to prank you guys, and it got a little out of hand.",6,10
Andy Dwyer,"I probably should've said no to some of his ideas, but he's on his way here right now.",6,10
Andy Dwyer,Here he is.,6,10
Andy Dwyer,Just be cool.,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, guys.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,What's up?,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Um, oh, I just remembered.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,Can I show you something out to the front area?,6,10
Ben Wyatt,And leave your cell phones because of no reason.,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Just leave anything that can't get wet, actually, like you would normally.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here we go to the parking lot now.",6,10
April Ludgate,"Wow, this is really sad.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, follow to me, guys.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,Just going to the parking lot for normal government reasons.,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, can't go through with this.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,I was gonna pull a prank.,6,10
April Ludgate,No!,6,10
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"I hired these guys in ski masks to kidnap us, and I was gonna pretend to be a hero.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,"They were gonna shoot me and drive the van into the river, and that's when the divers would go in, pull you guys out of the water, and I would be standing on the shore like, ""Hey, you get pranked much?""",6,10
Donna Meagle,What the [bleep]?,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"I even got these squibs from a special effects guy, and I was gonna say this code word.",6,10
Andy Dwyer,And that's when I would push this button.,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no!",6,10
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God.",6,10
April Ludgate,You got blood all over me.,6,10
April Ludgate,Thank you.,6,10

Chris Traeger,"Oh, how old is your son?",6,10
Theodore,Just pick a thing.,6,10
Ann Perkins,"Honey, look at this.",6,10
Ann Perkins,This is what I want.,6,10
Ann Perkins,I don't want a ring.,6,10
Ann Perkins,I don't want a wedding.,6,10
Ann Perkins,I just want this locket with a picture of our child in it.,6,10
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we've never been traditional.",6,10
Ann Perkins,We made out the first night we ever met.,6,10
Chris Traeger,"And when we did date, we broke up, but you didn't realize it, and that was very embarrassing for you.",6,10
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's maybe not talk about that part right now.",6,10
Chris Traeger,"And then we got pregnant as friends, and then we fell in love.",6,10
Chris Traeger,"We've never been very conventional, so why start now?",6,10
Chris Traeger,"Theodore? We will not be needing that ring, but we would like to purchase this locket.",6,10
Chris Traeger,How much?,6,10
Theodore,Just take it and get outta here.,6,10
Chris Traeger,Thank you!,6,10
Ann Perkins,Thanks.,6,10
Extra,We're here to discuss a business contract for the Lafayette Park food stand.,6,10
Extra,"Miss Knope, you've always steered this committee in the right direction.",6,10
Extra,Why do you think we should renew Hot Stu's lease?,6,10
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, it's because of Stu.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"And then he realized, ""No, I wanna spend my time in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat.""",6,10
Leslie Knope,"Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that.",6,10
Leslie Knope,Maybe a year extension isn't enough.,6,10
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make it five years.,6,10
Leslie Knope,"Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal?",6,10
Leslie Knope,I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.,6,10
Stu,I think I've made a terrible mistake.,6,10
Extra,"Okay, that was bleak.",6,10
Extra,"Uh. Mr. Haverford, you have a presentation as well?",6,10
Leslie Knope,Hey.,6,10
Leslie Knope,Rip it.,6,10
Tom Haverford,There's nothing more American than lemonade.,6,10
Tom Haverford,Just sayin' the word makes you wanna drink some.,6,10
Tom Haverford,And now you can.,6,10
Tom Haverford,Check under your seats.,6,10
Extra,"Heh, hey.",6,10
Extra,Has my name on it.,6,10
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it does.",6,10
Tom Haverford,"Classic for you, Carter.",6,10
Tom Haverford,"Darva, yours is a pink lemonade.",6,10
Tom Haverford,I know you love that.,6,10
Extra,Because I like pink.,6,10
Tom Haverford,That's right.,6,10
Tom Haverford,"Now, who here likes laser shows?",6,10
Tom Haverford,Summer foot traffic in Lafayette Park has increased 23%.,6,10
Tom Haverford,The Indiana Brothers are the fastest-growing beverage company in the Midwest.,6,10
Tom Haverford,My projections show they can increase government revenue 30% over the next five years.,6,10
Tom Haverford,"Plus, they've agreed to waive their franchise fee.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Look, guys, I'm sorry about all the new rules, But-- you know, I want you to like me.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,But I- I also really need you to respect me.,6,10
Andy Dwyer,"I respect you, little buddy.",6,10
Andy Dwyer,Come here.,6,10
Andy Dwyer,"Mm, respect noogie.",6,10
Ben Wyatt,Ah!,6,10
Donna Meagle,We didn't prank you 'cause we don't respect you.,6,10
Donna Meagle,We did it 'cause we love you.,6,10
Andy Dwyer,R e s p e g c,6,10
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's actually not how respect is spelled.",6,10
April Ludgate,Yes.,6,10
Andy Dwyer,"According to Urethra Franklin, that's exactly how it's spelled.",6,10
Extra,"Hey, Wyatt.",6,10
Extra,You were a good sport earlier.,6,10
Extra,No hard feelings?,6,10
Tom Haverford,Here's a little gift for you for believing in me.,6,10
Leslie Knope,Oh.,6,10
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based hair serum.,6,10
Tom Haverford,"Enough with the mousse, for real.",6,10
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,10
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, you were right.",6,10
Leslie Knope,Tom has really grown up.,6,10
Ron Swanson,You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.,6,10
Ron Swanson,Why?,6,10
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom's come into his own.",6,10
Leslie Knope,April runs Animal Control.,6,10
Leslie Knope,"I mean, does this department even need me anymore?",6,10
Ron Swanson,No.,6,10
Ron Swanson,We do not.,6,10
Ron Swanson,April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.,6,10
Ron Swanson,It's why I hired them.,6,10
Ron Swanson,Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.,6,10
Ron Swanson,This office can indeed function without you.,6,10
Ron Swanson,"And soon, it'll have to.",6,10
Leslie Knope,Was that a death threat?,6,10
Ron Swanson,We both know you're not gonna be here forever.,6,10
Ron Swanson,This is a weigh station on the road to bigger and better things.,6,10
Ron Swanson,"Whenever you do move on, it should please you to know that-- God help me-- you've built a well-functioning government agency.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that reminds me.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"I know you don't open your mail, but I do.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"And because you created Tom's position-- business liaison-- and it's already financially paying off, you have received Pawnee's government employee of the month.",6,10
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it has taken--",6,10

Leslie Knope,Really?,6,11
Chris Traeger,"Good morning, Ann Perkins.",6,11
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling today?,6,11
Ann Perkins,Perfect.,6,11
Ann Perkins,Except that I'm a whale and that my feet already kill.,6,11
Chris Traeger,Whales don't have feet.,6,11
Ann Perkins,I am a crazy shape.,6,11
Ann Perkins,"This morning when I got out of bed, I just tipped forward like a poorly made bowling pin.",6,11
Ann Perkins,Did I mention that my feet kill me all the time?,6,11
Chris Traeger,Oh!,6,11
Chris Traeger,Let me rub them.,6,11
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wait.",6,11
Chris Traeger,No.,6,11

Ann Perkins,I don't care.,6,11
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go choke down those horse pills I have to take every day.,6,11

Nolan,"Let's get ""recharded"" in here!",6,11
Leslie Knope,What the hell is going on?,6,11
Connie Cabbage,"Oh, yeah.",6,11
Connie Cabbage,That's the new chard stand.,6,11
Connie Cabbage,I suppose that's one way to sell vegetables.,6,11

Ben Wyatt,What do you want me to do?,6,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're the city manager.",6,11
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.,6,11
Leslie Knope,They're violating every single one of the farmers market's rules of conduct.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,"By ""rules of conduct,"" do you mean that wooden sign you made that says, ""Peas be kind to others""?",6,11
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and ""In case of fire, romaine calm,"" and ""You won't bay leaf how nice olive our vendors are.""",6,11
Leslie Knope,"I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns.",6,11
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I admit this is a little iffy, but",6,11
Leslie Knope,A little iffy?,6,11
Ben Wyatt,I can't do anything until I check the rules for city vendors.,6,11
Connie Cabbage,Cabbage!,6,11
Connie Cabbage,Come and get it.,6,11

Tom Haverford,I can't wash my face with hand soap.,6,11
Tom Haverford,Look at these pores.,6,11
Tom Haverford,They're gaping.,6,11
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys.",6,11
Tom Haverford,Timeout.,6,11
Tom Haverford,Let's take a brief recess.,6,11
Tom Haverford,"Can we help you, Ann?",6,11
Ann Perkins,"I was looking for Leslie, but now I'm curious why you guys are sitting around doing nothing and getting drunk at work.",6,11
Tom Haverford,"It's the whine & cheese club, gorgeous.",6,11
Tom Haverford,It's a monthly gathering where we all get together and vent about what annoys us at work.,6,11
Donna Meagle,"Over fine wines and cheeses, of course.",6,11
Ron Swanson,"Larry, salami!",6,11
Ron Swanson,The human resources department requires that I be available once a month to discuss workplace disputes with my employees.,6,11
Ron Swanson,The rules do not specify whether or not I'm allowed to listen to Willie Nelson on my headphones.,6,11
Jerry Gergich,And Kyle parked his car in my spot again.,6,11
Jerry Gergich,"Now, that is the fourth time this month.",6,11

Ann Perkins,I want to try.,6,11
Tom Haverford,"Mm, there's rules to this, sweet pea.",6,11
Tom Haverford,It's Donna's turn next.,6,11
Donna Meagle,I'll cede my time to Ann.,6,11
Donna Meagle,I have a feeling this is gonna be good.,6,11
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk for long, 'cause I have to pee again, 'cause I have to pee every six minutes, 'cause I have a beach ball in my stomach that's punching on my bladder.",6,11
Donna Meagle,That sucks.,6,11
Ann Perkins,I know.,6,11
Ann Perkins,And I'm never not hungry.,6,11
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, have some cheese.",6,11
Ann Perkins,"I can't have cheese, Larry!",6,11
Ann Perkins,And I can't have wine either.,6,11
Ann Perkins,I can't have anything good.,6,11
Ann Perkins,"You know, what I can have is liquefied flaxseed.",6,11
Ann Perkins,But I don't want that.,6,11
Ann Perkins,You know what I want?,6,11
Ann Perkins,Pork rinds.,6,11
Ann Perkins,I want jelly beans.,6,11
Ann Perkins,And I want a huge trash bag filled with mashed potatoes.,6,11
Ann Perkins,"I want to be PacMan, and instead of dots, I want 'em to be cinnamon buns.",6,11
Ann Perkins,"I want to be a giant head and a mouth, and I just want to eat rows and rows of junk food pellets, and where's my trash bag of potatoes?",6,11
Tom Haverford,Time.,6,11
Donna Meagle,Yikes.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Harrison Ford movie night.",6,11
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I was thinking more about that chard guy.",6,11
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it would be very easy for you to revoke their license.",6,11
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, this is city business, and I'm not an emperor.",6,11
Ben Wyatt,I can't just kick them out for no reason.,6,11
Leslie Knope,The reason is it's vegetable porn.,6,11
Leslie Knope,Porn on the cob.,6,11
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,6,11
Leslie Knope,I'm just very good at that.,6,11
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am not a prude, but the point is, people shouldn't be half naked, you know, in public, in the middle of the day, in front of children.",6,11
Leslie Knope,There's your reason.,6,11
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,"Look, now that we're working together again, maybe it would be good to keep our home life and our work life separate.",6,11
Ben Wyatt,"Like we only talk about work stuff when we're at city hall, like a firewall system.",6,11
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,6,11
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay.",6,11
Leslie Knope,That's smart.,6,11
Leslie Knope,"Home is home, and work is work.",6,11
Leslie Knope,We can always talk about this tomorrow at the office.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,Good.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,Glad you agree.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,All right.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,Crystal Skull it is.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's ridiculous to think that you could survive a nuclear blast by jumping into a refrigerator.",6,11
Leslie Knope,"Mmhmm, yeah, uh-huh.",6,11
Ben Wyatt,"But still, it's like",6,11
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I found a legal precedent to shut down those vegetable smut peddlers.",6,11
Ben Wyatt,What is happening?,6,11
Leslie Knope,"Firewall, man.",6,11
Leslie Knope,"We pulled into the parking lot, and this is technically city hall property, so now we're at work let's do this.",6,11
Leslie Knope,"The farmers market is a community meeting place, and that pansexual stripper show basically negates the whole purpose.",6,11
Leslie Knope,"So if you're looking for a reason to kick them out, here's 158.",6,11
Leslie Knope,The new farmers market rule book.,6,11
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, when did you make this?",6,11
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night.,6,11
Leslie Knope,I also made these: Leslie's toffee surprise.,6,11
Leslie Knope,The surprise is there's toffee in the inside.,6,11
Leslie Knope,You can eat those once you revoke the chard vendor's license.,6,11
Leslie Knope,"Good day, colleague.",6,11
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,6,11
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!,6,11
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling?,6,11
Ann Perkins,You don't want to know.,6,11
Chris Traeger,It's all I want to know.,6,11
Ann Perkins,"All right, man, you asked for it.",6,11
Ann Perkins,I have shooting pains that go all the way up from my butt to my neck.,6,11
Ann Perkins,My stomach has so many stretch marks on it that it looks like an old-fashioned globe.,6,11
Ann Perkins,My boobs are getting really sore.,6,11
Ann Perkins,"Also, I just read Brooke Shields' book on postpartum depression.",6,11
Ann Perkins,Now I have pre-postpartum depression anxiety.,6,11
Chris Traeger,"Well, never fear.",6,11
Chris Traeger,I will get you Tylenol for your pain and shea butter for your belly.,6,11
Chris Traeger,And your voluptuous figure only means your body is working exactly as nature intended it.,6,11
Chris Traeger,"There, it's all good.",6,11
Chris Traeger,Is that better?,6,11
Ann Perkins,Yeah.,6,11
Ann Perkins,Thanks.,6,11
Chris Traeger,I've been reading up on nipples.,6,11
Chris Traeger,"The reason that you're feeling nipple sensitivity is because your milk ducts in your nipples are opening up, which is why I bought you this nipple kit.",6,11
Chris Traeger,It's from Kernsten's: the nipple people.,6,11
Chris Traeger,"It has nipple cream, nipple pads, and also a special nipple pimple ointment in case you develop any pimples on your nipples.",6,11
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you have to stop using the word ""nipple.""",6,11
Chris Traeger,Okay.,6,11
Chris Traeger,Anyway.,6,11
Chris Traeger,Hopefully that will help you with any sensitivity that may arise around your boob hats.,6,11

Ann Perkins,Deal.,6,12
Leslie Knope,Easy.,6,12
Leslie Knope,It is not easy.,6,12

Chris Traeger,"Donna, are you grabbing my butt?",6,12
Donna Meagle,Can you blame me?,6,12

Kathryn Pinewood,I don't see why I should do you any favors.,6,12

Kathryn Pinewood,Is that right?,6,12
Leslie Knope,How dare you--,6,12

Ann Perkins,"And if you try to fight back, I will sue you.",6,12
Ann Perkins,Unless you tell us how to get those sodas right now.,6,12
Kathryn Pinewood,"Okay, fine.",6,12
Kathryn Pinewood,Sweetums has been desperately trying to get a local celebrity spokesman to endorse their new sports drink.,6,12
Kathryn Pinewood,"So if you can make that happen somehow, they'll give you whatever you want.",6,12
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Perkins.",6,12
Ann Perkins,"Okay, who does Sweetums want as their spokesperson?",6,12
Pete Disellio,They already tried to get me to endorse that sports drink.,6,12
Pete Disellio,"I said ""No.""",6,12
Pete Disellio,They want me dunking on the label.,6,12
Pete Disellio,When is this town gonna realize that I'm more than a former high school basketball star?,6,12
Leslie Knope,I don't think this new sports drink is even about basketball.,6,12
Pete Disellio,"It's called ""Sweetums dunktastic threepoint Bball blast"" the slogan is ""It's all about basketball.""",6,12
Pete Disellio,"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to find yourself some other famous pawneean.",6,12
Leslie Knope,"We know that you were already approached by Sweetums and you said ""No,"" but is there any way you would reconsider?",6,12

Leslie Knope,For old time's sake?,6,12
Leslie Knope,Does that mean-- no!,6,12
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky minx.",6,12
Ann Perkins,Yep.,6,12
Ann Perkins,I went on a date with Perd.,6,12
Leslie Knope,What?,6,12
Ann Perkins,"It was during that ""explore my freedom as a single woman"" phase.",6,12
Leslie Knope,Wow.,6,12
Ann Perkins,We just had a drink.,6,12
Ann Perkins,"And at the end he said, ""I am going to kiss you now by putting my mouth on your mouth.""",6,12
Ann Perkins,And then I ran away.,6,12
Leslie Knope,It was absolutely the right call.,6,12
Jerry Gergich,"Well, we could just tell him the truth that we feel bad that we didn't get him anything nice.",6,12
Tom Haverford,Tell the truth?,6,12
Tom Haverford,That's hilarious.,6,12
Tom Haverford,No.,6,12
Tom Haverford,"We tell him we had the perfect gift, but we were robbed at gunpoint.",6,12
Tom Haverford,"""Chris, he had a gun.""",6,12
Tom Haverford,"""He took all the gifts.""",6,12

Ben Wyatt,We feel bad because you got us such thoughtful gifts and we got you three pans and a bag of nothing.,6,12
Chris Traeger,"Guys, I don't need anything from you.",6,12
Chris Traeger,"My buddy boxes are about the past, but let's focus on the future.",6,12
Chris Traeger,Because we're always gonna be friends.,6,12
Chris Traeger,And just the fact that you feel bad about your bag of nothing proves that.,6,12
Chris Traeger,To the future.,6,12
Jerry Gergich,"Hear, hear.",6,12
Ben Wyatt,To the future.,6,12
Tom Haverford,To the future.,6,12
Jerry Gergich,Cheers.,6,12
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.,6,12
Jerry Gergich,Future.,6,12

Leslie Knope,Everything's here in writing.,6,12
Leslie Knope,Now call off your guards.,6,12
Harold,Okay.,6,12
Harold,Fine.,6,12
Harold,You two are a couple of real pains in the ass.,6,12
Harold,You know that?,6,12
Leslie Knope,"Harold, your tiny brain could not understand this, but that is the best compliment you could ever give the two women standing in front of you.",6,12
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Harold.",6,12
Leslie Knope,Victory at last.,6,12

Ann Perkins,What are you doing?,6,12
Leslie Knope,It's for the raccoons.,6,12
Leslie Knope,You have to hiss really loud and stomp your feet so they'll leave you alone.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"And if one comes close, make yourself really large like a puffer fish.",6,12
Ann Perkins,Pawnee raccoons.,6,12
Ann Perkins,That is one thing I will not miss.,6,12
April Ludgate,"Well, Michigan has wolverines.",6,12
April Ludgate,Maybe they'll eat your toes.,6,12
Ann Perkins,So how long do you think you'll stay in Pawnee for?,6,12
April Ludgate,I don't know.,6,12
April Ludgate,We like it here.,6,12
April Ludgate,"I made Andy promise that someday we'll move to Transylvania, but that probably won't happen till we're, like, 100.",6,12

Ann Perkins,I couldn't-- I couldn't quite hear you.,6,12
April Ludgate,Please don't make me say it.,6,12
April Ludgate,Please.,6,12

Chris Traeger,"I call it my ""beat the sun"" run.",6,12
Chris Traeger,It's a race between me and the sun.,6,12
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we got one more gift for you.",6,12
Ron Swanson,It's quarter-sawn zebra wood adjoined by floating tenons to the black walnut corner posts.,6,12
Ron Swanson,Finished with a wiping varnish that's a secret Swanson family recipe.,6,12
Ron Swanson,"Handmade at my woodshop, and you are correct.",6,12
Ron Swanson,It is gorgeous.,6,12
Ben Wyatt,"You're starting a new life with your new family, so it's an empty buddy box to fill with memories for your little buddy.",6,12

Jerry Gergich,I really-- I didn't know what to do.,6,12

Chris Traeger,"Will do, Ron Swanson.",6,12
Leslie Knope,Can I still call you when I have thoughts on Jennifer Aniston's future?,6,12
Ann Perkins,Not if I call you first.,6,12

Ann Perkins,Of course.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann Perkins.",6,12
Leslie Knope,You perfect sunflower.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"You totally changed me, you know? You taught me how to balance my life, how to be patient.",6,12
Ann Perkins,Mm,6,12
Leslie Knope,How to be more patient.,6,12
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's better.",6,12
Leslie Knope,How to throw bureaucratic caution to the wind when it came to Ben.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you taught me that I can't pull off a tulip skirt.",6,12
Ann Perkins,It's just not your shape.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't think this ceremonial ribbon cutting guy is gonna make it.",6,12
Leslie Knope,Either he flaked or he tripped and impaled himself on his own giant scissors.,6,12
Ann Perkins,We wait for no man.,6,12
Ann Perkins,Let's do this.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three!",6,12
Ann Perkins,"One, two, three!",6,12

Ann Perkins,That's all I wanted from you.,6,12
Ann Perkins,Friendship over.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"Don't even joke about that, Ann.",6,12
Chris Traeger,It was your idea to get me that box.,6,12
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, it was a group effort.",6,12
Chris Traeger,But it had that trademark Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful and resourceful.,6,12
Chris Traeger,You are literally the best friend that I will ever have.,6,12
Ben Wyatt,"You too, man.",6,12
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.,6,12
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger.,6,12
Chris Traeger,I just wanna say that getting to know you and watching you work has been one of the greatest experiences of my life-- that and working with Dr. Richard Nygard.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"Sure, and I just want you to know that I thought there was no man on earth good enough for Ann Perkins.",6,12
Leslie Knope,And I still think that.,6,12
Chris Traeger,Right.,6,12
Leslie Knope,"But if there is no one actually good enough for her, you are pretty damn close.",6,12
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, this is normal.",6,12
Leslie Knope,No big deal.,6,12
Leslie Knope,Drive safe.,6,12
Ann Perkins,We will.,6,12

Ron Swanson,There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food.,6,12
Leslie Knope,That's fair.,6,12
Leslie Knope,Someone else is gonna have to drive though.,6,12
Leslie Knope,My eyes are basically useless right now.,6,12
Tom Haverford,I'm on it.,6,12
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun! I called shotgun!,6,12
Andy Dwyer,You're all nailed.,6,12
April Ludgate,I call sitting on your lap.,6,12
Andy Dwyer,You can't-- I-- double shotgun! We call double shotgun! How come people don't do that more often?,6,12
Ben Wyatt,It's illegal.,6,12
Leslie Knope,Raise you hand if you want waffles.,6,12

Leslie Knope,There's still a little animosity between the two towns.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizza stuffed crust pizza.,6,14
Leslie Knope,It was a pizza whose crust was stuffed with little pizzas.,6,14
Leslie Knope,And the crust of those little pizzas was made of chocolate.,6,14
August Clementine,"Ms. Knope, I understand you're here today to try to convince us that this disastrous merger of our two towns was, in any way, a good idea.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there were some bumps and bruises.",6,14
Leslie Knope,And a brief rash of arson.,6,14
Leslie Knope,And a rather large-scale brawl at the dump.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"But overall, the state of the merger is very strong.",6,14
August Clementine,Scoff.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Did you just say the word ""scoff""?",6,14
Derry Murbles,"You must admit, Ms. Knope, that the merging of the towns has been fraught with antipathy.",6,14
Derry Murbles,"For example, I now have to share my studio with a fatuous twerp who shall remain nameless.",6,14
August Clementine,This twerp has a name.,6,14
August Clementine,And it's August N'gutu Liebowitz-Clementine.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Guys... Hello.,6,14
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much for letting me help plan your anniversary.,6,14
Jerry Gergich,It is so wonderful to be part of such a special day.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, remember, under no circumstances can Leslie know about what's going on.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"She has to make that face, do you understand?",6,14
Jerry Gergich,"No, I don't fully, but my lips are sealed.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"I asked for Larry's help because he has the most successful marriage of anyone I know, to a gorgeous woman.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Which, honestly, is still a mystery to me.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Like, was it a hypnosis accident or something, where they put Gayle under and made her fall in love with Larry and never said the magic word to snap her out of it?",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Like, if I say ""nutmeg,"" will she wake up and start screaming?",6,14
April Ludgate,What kind of pet are you interested in adopting?,6,14
April Ludgate,"We have dogs, cats, rabbits.",6,14
April Ludgate,"Um, I work here, so, legally, you can adopt me.",6,14
Ron Swanson,The girls want an actual dog.,6,14
Ron Swanson,And they want it to look like this.,6,14
April Ludgate,Interesting.,6,14
April Ludgate,"So, like a banana made of spiders?",6,14
Ron Swanson,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, children are terrible artists.",6,14
Ron Swanson,And artists are crooks.,6,14
April Ludgate,I think I know a good dog.,6,14
April Ludgate,There he is!,6,14
April Ludgate,"Ron, how about this guy?",6,14
Ron Swanson,"Yes, he is a handsome fellow.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"Hello, dog.",6,14
Ron Swanson,I'll take him.,6,14
April Ludgate,That was easy.,6,14
April Ludgate,Awesome.,6,14
April Ludgate,"Well, Donna can help you get started on the paperwork.",6,14
April Ludgate,Donna?,6,14
Ron Swanson,"""Why lie?""",6,14
Ron Swanson,"""I'm shopping.""",6,14
Ron Swanson,"""Back in an hour.""",6,14
April Ludgate,Ugh!,6,14

Leslie Knope,"Hello, caller.",6,14
Leslie Knope,You have a comment?,6,14
Extra,"Yeah, ever since the merger, we've had a really bad trash problem.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, there has been some confusion with some of the garbage routes.",6,14
Leslie Knope,And the Sanitation Department is stretched a little thin.,6,14
Extra,"No, I mean Eagletonians are human garbage.",6,14
Extra,And we should throw them in a dumpster.,6,14
Extra,Kapow!,6,14
Extra,"Yeah, I really like the merger, but I hate that Eagleton was forced to join Pawnee.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's what the merger is.",6,14
Extra,Oh.,6,14
Extra,"Yeah, then I hate the merger.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,I think the merger was great.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,And I think Leslie Knope did an amazing job.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"I don't know who this is, but I agree.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy!,6,14
Leslie Knope,Hey.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,I'm on the radio!,6,14
Derry Murbles,That's all the time we have on Thought For Your Thoughts.,6,14
Derry Murbles,I'm Derry Murbles.,6,14
August Clementine,And I'm August Clementine.,6,14
August Clementine,And I talked last.,6,14
August Clementine,Good day.,6,14
April Ludgate,Is this land mine still functional?,6,14
Ron Swanson,Partially.,6,14
Ron Swanson,Why?,6,14
April Ludgate,Because I want to blow up Donna's desk so I can teach her a lesson about what happens when you skip work.,6,14
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure that's how you should go about this.,6,14
April Ludgate,"I'm kind of her boss, now, but I still feel weird disciplining her.",6,14
April Ludgate,What do I do?,6,14
Ron Swanson,Look her in the eyes and tell her exactly what you need from her.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"Be mature, direct, and firm.",6,14
Donna Meagle,What?,6,14
Donna Meagle,Some fool just slammed me on Yelp.,6,14
April Ludgate,I took Ron's advice.,6,14
April Ludgate,I very maturely and straightforwardly left anonymous comments about Donna online.,6,14
Donna Meagle,"""Stopped by to adopt a dog, but the employee, Donna Meagle, was nowhere to be found.""",6,14
Donna Meagle,"""Thanks for nothing, Donna Meagle.""",6,14
Donna Meagle,"""Booooo!""",6,14
Donna Meagle,"With five ""O""s.",6,14
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that sucks.",6,14
April Ludgate,"Just have to work harder, I guess, huh?",6,14
Donna Meagle,This freak thinks he can hide behind some anonymous user name?,6,14
Donna Meagle,I'm about to hunt you down.,6,14
Tom Haverford,"Don't be upset, Leslie.",6,14
Tom Haverford,No one listens to the radio.,6,14
Tom Haverford,I wasn't even listening.,6,14
Tom Haverford,I was listening to podcasts.,6,14
Tom Haverford,Podcasts are great.,6,14
Tom Haverford,Radio is boring.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this merger needs a win-- something symbolic and bright and happy that will show that there's light at the end of the tunnel.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so stressed.",6,14
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you for a second?",6,14
Jerry Gergich,Something very special to show you.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Now is not the time, Larry.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Please leave.,6,14
Jerry Gergich,I think you--,6,14

Leslie Knope,I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton were as happy as Ben and me.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, by the way, I was gonna mention, you look really old in this picture.",6,14
Leslie Knope,What?,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Andy, this is a picture of us.",6,14
Leslie Knope,This is a picture of an elderly couple.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Rosie and Doug DeMarco.,6,14
Leslie Knope,They've been married for 50 years.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"""Rosie Hails from Pawnee, while Doug is originally from the former Eagleton.""",6,14
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is perfect.",6,14
Leslie Knope,A Pawnee Eagleton couple that has been married for 50 years is a perfect symbol of how our towns can get along.,6,14
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna hold them up as an example of Pawnee Eagleton unity.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Whoo!,6,14
Leslie Knope,I'm getting the epiphany sweats.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Stop where you are and take off your clothes.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,It's couples massage.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Where's Leslie?,6,14
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, she seemed kind of stressed out.",6,14
Jerry Gergich,"And then she yelled at me, and she said she was too busy to come.",6,14
Jerry Gergich,And since you had said do not tell her the secret under any circumstances--,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, man.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's a danger of doing things a day early, I guess.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,Should I text her and try again?,6,14
Jerry Gergich,"Why don't you just go ahead and get your massage, and then hopefully we can get her in for the next thing.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,I have been kind of tense lately.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Just thinking about the new Star Wars sequel.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,I'm afraid they're gonna rely too heavily on CGI.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,And I'm carrying it all in my shoulders.,6,14
Extra,Just you?,6,14
Extra,You paid for a couple.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Well, can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh Larry, would you like to get a couples massage with me?",6,14
Jerry Gergich,I would love to.,6,14
Tom Haverford,Are we sure we should do this?,6,14
Tom Haverford,"Last time we scared an old person, Larry had a heart attack.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,That was awesome.,6,14

Leslie Knope,A golden anniversary celebration.,6,14
Rosie DeMarco,So no money.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check is.",6,14
Tom Haverford,Told you.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you did, Tom.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Now is not the time.,6,14

Donna Meagle,Ignore it?,6,14
Donna Meagle,I'm about to come down on this dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.,6,14
Donna Meagle,I'm about to go Mjolnir on his ass!,6,14

Ron Swanson,Of course I did.,6,14
Ron Swanson,What's gonna happen?,6,14
Ron Swanson,A vegan is gonna physically attack me?,6,14
Ron Swanson,They're basically made of glass.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"But more importantly, if you believe in something, you sign your name to it.",6,14
Ron Swanson,Which is why the makers of carbonated water will soon know exactly where to find me.,6,14

Leslie Knope,I don't-- I don't-- I don't even-- You know what I mean?,6,14
Madison,What's wrong with her? Why is making those noises?,6,14

Leslie Knope,Enough's enough.,6,14

Ron Swanson,"Dear God, woman.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"Three main activities: baby bingo, baby food tasting, and my personal favorite baby onesie decorating station.",6,14
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make mine look like an astronaut.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"What are you doing up there in space, baby?",6,14
Leslie Knope,Ah!,6,14
Leslie Knope,So cute!,6,14
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I have some gift ideas.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I was looking at a very adorable stroller.,6,14
Ron Swanson,We already have a stroller.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shoot.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Really?,6,14
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to think of something else.,6,14

Ron Swanson,"Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my son, John middle name redacted Swanson.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"John was born some time ago, weighing multiple pounds and several ounces.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"Much like his father, he is a fan of silence.",6,14
Ron Swanson,Please keep your voices down.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"How am I supposed to keep my voice down when you had your baby, and you didn't tell me that you had your baby?",6,14
Ron Swanson,Why would you need to know something like that?,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Why would I-- oh, my God.",6,14
Leslie Knope,I have not even sent Diane a gift.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"She's just walking around, wondering why I haven't sent her a gift yet.",6,14
April Ludgate,Should we do something?,6,14
Ron Swanson,Just let her tire herself out.,6,14
Jerry Gergich,"If you need anything from us, Ron, please just let us know.",6,14

Leslie Knope,Madison.,6,14
Madison,"So far, 12 bands have said yes.",6,14
Madison,And we asked them all to submit a song for the new town anthem contest.,6,14
April Ludgate,I think we should book Orin as a headliner.,6,14
April Ludgate,I think it's a no-brainer.,6,14
April Ludgate,"Um, he dislocates his shoulder to the music of Billy Joel.",6,14
April Ludgate,"The Pawnee Journal called it, ""Why would anyone do this?""",6,14
Leslie Knope,Stop suggesting Orin.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Craig, any update on the art tents?",6,14
Craig Middlebrooks,14 local artists signed up to show their work.,6,14
Craig Middlebrooks,"It was going to be 15, but then this one guy described himself as ""Jackson Pollockesque"" and I told him that's finger painting for adults and I hate it!",6,14
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerate slash ignore me.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario.",6,14
Leslie Knope,You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.,6,14
Leslie Knope,No one knows who that is?,6,14
Andy Dwyer,"Um, I do.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,"""Grant Larson,"" otherwise known as Elton John.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,"Congratulations, Leslie.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"No, Grant Larson is the director of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service.",6,14
Leslie Knope,He's basically the Liam Bonneville of the Midwest.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville?,6,14
Leslie Knope,The department of the interior's resident bad boy?,6,14
Leslie Knope,"He's basically the Tim Dweck-- Okay, never mind.",6,14
Leslie Knope,I have asked Grant to declare Eagleton Hills a national park as the grand finale of our unity concert.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,"Great idea, Leslie.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"And with that update, the Pawnee new founder's day unity concert is now officially ahead of schedule!",6,14
Leslie Knope,And that banner unfurling marks the 100th time that one of my projects has been ahead of schedule.,6,14
Tom Haverford,"This is your chance to put your names on the Pawnee unity concert, the biggest event of 2014 besides the unveiling of Tricia's new highlights.",6,14
Tom Haverford,You think I wouldn't notice?,6,14
Tom Haverford,"You look fly as hell, girl!",6,14
Tom Haverford,"This unity concert needs corporate sponsorship, so Ben and I are meeting with local bigwigs.",6,14
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna do what I do best-- lock down deals.,6,14
Tom Haverford,And dorkasaurus over here is gonna handle the boring stuff.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,You said you genuinely valued my business acumen.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm your boss.",6,14
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, he's so cute.",6,14
Donna Meagle,You're the cutest little boobear I've ever seen.,6,14
Craig Middlebrooks,You are the world's most adorable baby and I love you!,6,14

Jerry Gergich,Look what Gayle made for the baby.,6,14
Jerry Gergich,"It says ""Property of Pawnee government.""",6,14
Jerry Gergich,Isn't that adorable?,6,14
Ron Swanson,"Come on, John.",6,14
Donna Meagle,Jeez.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Here we are the park that borders Pawnee and Eagleton.,6,14
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect place for the press conference to announce our unity concert.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"People are gonna clap, they're gonna cheer.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Today might be the day that I finally crowd surf.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I should probably empty my pockets just in case.,6,14
April Ludgate,"Hey, one question.",6,14
April Ludgate,"Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says ""Pawnee, you suck,"" or ""Go home, Eagleton snobs""?",6,14
Leslie Knope,I painted over that graffiti a week ago.,6,14
Leslie Knope,These people are the worst!,6,14
Leslie Knope,I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"You know, why do we even have this wall?",6,14
Leslie Knope,"We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them.",6,14
Leslie Knope,We should just knock it down.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,"On it, boss.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!,6,14
Andy Dwyer,Ow.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,The kool-aid guy makes it look so easy.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"In the time I've worked here, I've taken great pains to see as little of this building as possible.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"Turns out the third floor is silent, empty, and completely free of government work.",6,14
Ron Swanson,I can't think of anything more beautiful to share with my son.,6,14
Ron Swanson,If I had a toolbox I could take care of that faulty radiator.,6,14
Ron Swanson,Ooh!,6,14
Ron Swanson,This place is a paradise!,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Nicely done, Tom.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,We have 15 sponsorship offers.,6,14

Tom Haverford,Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!,6,14
Mitch Savner,That's it.,6,14
Tom Haverford,You guys make my favorite teeth whitening strips pearlies for girlies.,6,14
Tom Haverford,It's unisex.,6,14
Tom Haverford,The cartoon princess on the label says so.,6,14
Mitch Savner,I'll sponsor your concert.,6,14
Mitch Savner,But I'm also looking to invest in other ventures.,6,14
Mitch Savner,I have a feeling a bright guy like you has some ideas of his own.,6,14
Tom Haverford,I may have a few eggs ready to hatch in the personal idea nest.,6,14
Mitch Savner,Why don't you come to my office tomorrow and pitch me your hottest idea?,6,14
Tom Haverford,Perfect!,6,14
Tom Haverford,I'll see you then.,6,14

Leslie Knope,And a special thank you to the city council for their support.,6,14
Jeremy Jamm,I was told there'd be a free barbecue buffet?,6,14

Jeremy Jamm,[Bleep]!,6,14
Andy Dwyer,"Don't worry, babe, I'll protect you.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,"I got stung once, I'm immune.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,"Go ahead and sting me, bees.",6,14
Andy Dwyer,It does nothing.,6,14
Extra,"Leslie, it appears that most of the people that were stung were from Eagleton.",6,14
Extra,How did you pull that off?,6,14
Leslie Knope,I didn't pull anything off.,6,14
Leslie Knope,The Eagletonians were simply closest to the wall.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Plus, one Pawneean was stung in his mouth because he was laughing at the Eagletonians.",6,14
Extra,"How did you get your bees into the wall, and how long did it take to plan this hilarious bee prank on Eagleton?",6,14
Leslie Knope,"They were not my bees, Trodd.",6,14
Leslie Knope,And for the last time this was not a prank.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I did not know that bees were in that wall.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"I mean, in fact you should treat this like a public service announcement.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Everybodyâ¦ should check their walls for bees.,6,14
Extra,"Nice try, prank queen.",6,14
Extra,Probably bees in there.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's all the time I have.",6,14
Extra,What else can you do with your bees?,6,14
Extra,"Leslie, what's your next prank?",6,14
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.,6,14
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, Grant Larson is on the phone from the National Park Service.",6,14

Leslie Knope,Don't mention my bee hole.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"Just as we suspected, John.",6,14

Ron Swanson,Andâ¦ that should do it.,6,14
Extra,Can we help you?,6,14
Ron Swanson,No.,6,14
Ron Swanson,We have everything under control.,6,14
Extra,My crew's redoing this whole floor.,6,14

Ron Swanson,My son is several weeks old.,6,14
Ron Swanson,He's quite familiar with the sound of power tools.,6,14
Tom Haverford,"Okay, how about this one Lasik for fingernails?",6,14
Tom Haverford,"Cut your fingernails once, never have to cut 'em again.",6,14
Tom Haverford,All we need is a complicated laser I have no idea how to build.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Seems impossible.,6,14
Tom Haverford,All right.,6,14
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh!,6,14
Tom Haverford,"""Saltweens.""",6,14
Tom Haverford,Saltines for tweens.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Seems unnecessary?,6,14
Tom Haverford,The only business idea I have that's even remotely fleshed out is a restaurant.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,No way.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Restaurants were ranked number one in Accounting Magazine's ""Riskiest Businesses"" issue.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"That was their last issue before they folded, actually.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,Magazines are also very risky.,6,14

Ben Wyatt,"But I have to warn you, it's not super sexy.",6,14
Tom Haverford,What is it?,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, listen up.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,You would be the middleman between dry cleaners and the companies that sell chemicals to dry cleaners.,6,14
Tom Haverford,Wow!,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Right?,6,14
Tom Haverford,"You're right, man.",6,14
Tom Haverford,That is not sexy.,6,14
Mike Patterson,Leslie Knope's little stunt put three people in the hospital.,6,14

Craig Middlebrooks,"When he sinks his teeth into something, he's like a dog with a bone!",6,14
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!",6,14
April Ludgate,You can't lean in to whisper and then yell.,6,14
April Ludgate,That's not fair.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"This merger is so fragile, everyone is on edge, and no one is talking about the unity concert.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody think that was a prank?,6,14
Andy Dwyer,So sad.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,People will believe anything.,6,14
Andy Dwyer,"It was a prank though, right?",6,14
April Ludgate,"No more press, okay?",6,14
April Ludgate,You just have to lay low for a while.,6,14
April Ludgate,I promise it'll all blow over.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"April, your competence and your levelheadedness is very moving to me, and I will follow your advice right after I go to the hospital and apologize to every victim in person.",6,14

Leslie Knope,"Fine, I won't bring any.",6,14
Craig Middlebrooks,Aghh!,6,14

Ron Swanson,Deal.,6,14
Ron Swanson,I will do all this work for you in the time allotted.,6,14
Ron Swanson,Just have your tools and materials brought up here.,6,14
Extra,Are you crazy?,6,14
Extra,This is enough work for a whole crew.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"I'm sure the government believed you when you told them that, and I tip my cap to you for profiting off their ignorance.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"But I'm offering you two months paid vacation and the ability to take credit for my work, which will be flawless.",6,14
Extra,Okay.,6,14
Extra,"Guys, let's go!",6,14
Ron Swanson,I got all help I'll need right here.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is the really exciting part.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"We buy tetrachloroethylene at 1.60 a gallon, but we sell it back at 2.38 a gallon.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,Now I know what you're thinking.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,What if it's a cleaner who wants to buy glycol ethers?,6,14
Tom Haverford,"Ben, stop!",6,14
Tom Haverford,This is so boring!,6,14
Tom Haverford,This is like listening to a TED talk by the color beige.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know this idea doesn't excite you.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,But I promise it'll make you a lot of money.,6,14
Tom Haverford,"Well, I sold tons of awesome stuff.",6,14
Tom Haverford,Guess it makes sense my next challenge is to sell something mind-numbingly dull.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Dull?,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Does this look dull to you?,6,14
Tom Haverford,Ahhhh.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I'm so incredibly sorry.,6,14

Jeremy Jamm,I knew we were besties.,6,14
Jeremy Jamm,"What do you got in there for me, some dirty mags?",6,14
Leslie Knope,No!,6,14

Leslie Knope,This is not a publicity stunt.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I just came here by myself to apologize to all the Eagletonians who got stung.,6,14
Mike Patterson,Really?,6,14
Mike Patterson,"Because all we see is you talking to your friend, known Eagleton hater Jeremy Jamm.",6,14
Jeremy Jamm,"Excuse me, Mike.",6,14
Jeremy Jamm,"That's, uh, best friend.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Pawneeans and Eagletonians need to find a way to come together and bury the hatchet.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter who bailed out who, or who seceded from you.",6,14
Jeremy Jamm,"Awesome idea, Lezzie.",6,14
Jeremy Jamm,As a matter of fact I say we should secede from Eagleton!,6,14
Jeremy Jamm,Whose dumbass idea was it for them to merge anyway?,6,14
Leslie Knope,Mine.,6,14
Leslie Knope,It was my idea.,6,14
Mike Patterson,You heard it here first.,6,14
Mike Patterson,Self-proclaimed dumbass Leslie Knope and councilman Jeremy Jamm are spearheading a Pawnee secession movement.,6,14

Leslie Knope,It's to distract people from my black eye.,6,14
Leslie Knope,See?,6,14
Leslie Knope,It's working.,6,14
April Ludgate,Cool.,6,14
April Ludgate,"Um well, there is some good news.",6,14
April Ludgate,"That Mike Patterson guy's show just aired, everyone is angry, and Jamm is introducing a secession bill at the next city council meeting.",6,14
Leslie Knope,How is any of that good news?,6,14
April Ludgate,It's not.,6,14
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to have a brief moment of happiness before you got sadder.,6,14
April Ludgate,Those jerks that hate the merger are a minority.,6,14
April Ludgate,They're just shouting louder than everyone else.,6,14
April Ludgate,I'm sorry this town keeps being stupid and letting you down.,6,14
April Ludgate,It sucks.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, April.",6,14

Leslie Knope,It sucks.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"You're right, everything sucks.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Everything I try with this merger backfires.,6,14

Tom Haverford,"Classy, authentic ambience in a small-town setting.",6,14
Mitch Savner,"Why does that say ""dry cleaning chemical transactional holding company?""",6,14
Tom Haverford,Ben! You brought the wrong easel.,6,14
Tom Haverford,God! Can't take this guy anywhere.,6,14
Tom Haverford,Let me paint you a picture.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry.",6,14
Leslie Knope,I had to reschedule.,6,14
Leslie Knope,It's been kind of a hectic week.,6,14
Grant Larson,What happened to your face?,6,14
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.,6,14
Grant Larson,"I read your request, Ms. Knope, and I'm sorry, but we can't make that happen.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Great.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Well, this week just keeps getting better and better.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.,6,14
Grant Larson,I came here because I wanted to meet you.,6,14
Grant Larson,I've actually wanted to meet you since before you called me.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Really? You know who I am?,6,14
Grant Larson,Yes.,6,14
Grant Larson,You're the person who wrote this.,6,14
Leslie Knope,You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river? I wrote this two years ago.,6,14
Grant Larson,Got shuffled around in interior for a year and half.,6,14
Grant Larson,"Liam Bonneville actually used it to humiliate staffers, but he's kind of a bad boy.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Liam B-- You don't have to tell me!,6,14
Grant Larson,This report is legendary.,6,14
Grant Larson,It's easily the most thoroughly research and passionate grant request I've ever seen.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that.",6,14
Leslie Knope,But you're a little late.,6,14
Leslie Knope,The river cleanup's well underway.,6,14
Grant Larson,This is bigger than the river cleanup.,6,14
Grant Larson,We're opening a new office in Chicago.,6,14
Grant Larson,I spent the last few weeks reading about you and your career and I think that you're the perfect person to run it.,6,14
Grant Larson,"Leslie, would you like to run a branch of the National Park Service?",6,14
Tom Haverford,"Tom's Bistro will have all the classic elements, but with modern twists-- an oak bar, live music, and Sunday brunch with scrambled eggs so fluffy they'll be like little pillows for your bacon.",6,14
Mitch Savner,Bacon pillows.,6,14
Mitch Savner,I like the sound of that.,6,14
Mitch Savner,"But I have to say, restaurants are incredibly risky.",6,14
Mitch Savner,Most of them are dead on arrival.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"We're well-aware of that, but believe me, Tom has thought this out.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"See, there's plenty of real estate available in the old Eagleton part of town.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"And with the recent closures, there's massive demand for affordable dining that feels high-end.",6,14
Mitch Savner,"Okay! As long as you're running, I'm in.",6,14
Tom Haverford,Amazing!,6,14
Mitch Savner,"Hey, kid your boss here sure knows his stuff.",6,14
Leslie Knope,Ron.,6,14
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?,6,14
Ron Swanson,The most important government work I've ever done-- sanding rat urine stains out of this floor.,6,14
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?,6,14
Leslie Knope,I come here to think sometimes.,6,14
Leslie Knope,By myself.,6,14
Leslie Knope,But now that you're hereâ¦,6,14
Ron Swanson,Damn it.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"That is my ideal conversation, aside from no conversation.",6,14
Ron Swanson,But that feels unlikely.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Look, you know how much I love Pawnee.",6,14
Leslie Knope,But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger.",6,14
Leslie Knope,They literally punch me in the face.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it.",6,14
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with me?,6,14
Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"This subpar toolbox only had one wrench, so I was lucky it was a three-quarters or I'd have been screwed.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, man, you are lucky.",6,14
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron.",6,14
Leslie Knope,What the hell? I need your help.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"By the time I was done, this 100-year-old piece of American-made cast iron was singing like a bird.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"Now, to most people, this story would seem boring.",6,14
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.,6,14
Leslie Knope,It's a story about a radiator.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"But to me, it was immensely satisfying because I enjoy fixing radiators.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"You like fixing this town, Leslie, you always have.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"You know it's an uphill battle, but you love the struggle.",6,14
Ron Swanson,"I would also add that you've already done a hell of a lot to make this town better, and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work.",6,14
Leslie Knope,He is a beautiful boy.,6,14
Ron Swanson,He's quite a looker.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron.",6,14
Leslie Knope,What's that?,6,14
Ron Swanson,Nothing.,6,14
Ron Swanson,Clearing my throat.,6,14
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking about your offer.,6,14
Leslie Knope,And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it.,6,14
Grant Larson,That's great! I'll start drawing up the paperwork.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it.",6,14
Grant Larson,"Okay, wow, that's very misleading phraseology.",6,14
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me.",6,14
Leslie Knope,And I won't know until I finish what I've started.,6,14
Leslie Knope,When do you need your answer?,6,14
Grant Larson,"Well, the gears of federal government grind pretty slowly, so you have a little time.",6,14
Grant Larson,But we can't wait forever.,6,14
Grant Larson,I'll be in touch.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Great.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,6,14
Leslie Knope,That's not your hand.,6,14
Leslie Knope,Here it is.,6,14
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Really happy that worked out for you, Tom, but you kinda sold me out back there.",6,14
Tom Haverford,"I know, and I'm sorry.",6,14
Tom Haverford,"But Mitch asked me what I was passionate about, and honestly I'm never gonna be passionate about dry cleaning chemicals.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,"To each his own, I guess.",6,14
Tom Haverford,"I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work.",6,14
Tom Haverford,I know I can!,6,14
Ben Wyatt,Then count me in as the second investor in Tom's Bistro.,6,14
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, man.",6,14
Tom Haverford,"I know this is a symbolic gesture, but my investor floor is $1,000.",6,14
Tom Haverford,"So as of now, you own zero shares.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,Cool! Thanks for clearing that up.,6,14
Ben Wyatt,"Now go do work, or I will fire you.",6,14
Ben Wyatt,I'm not kidding.,6,14
Tom Haverford,Yep!,6,14
Ron Swanson,"Oh, look, John.",6,14
Ron Swanson,It's red pine.,6,14
Ron Swanson,They were gonna put flecked linoleum over this beautifully preserved knotty red pine.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"Most people in this world, John, are ass[bleep].",6,14
Ron Swanson,"This is the best day I've ever spent in a government building, and luckily my son was here to share it with me.",6,14
Ron Swanson,He now has that satisfied look that only comes with the pride of labor.,6,14
Ron Swanson,Or he pooped.,6,14
Ron Swanson,"Either way, well done, John.",6,14

Andy Dwyer,Are there any places out there I should check out?,6,15
Craig Middlebrooks,I used to go see live shows at Patterson's.,6,15
Craig Middlebrooks,But I'm boycotting until the owner apologizes for what she said to me at the dog park.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,Cool.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,Anything else?,6,15
Craig Middlebrooks,I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty packed on Thursdays.,6,15
Craig Middlebrooks,But I've never been because it's mostly middle aged women and I'm allergic to turkey neck.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,Really?,6,15

Leslie Knope,"Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?",6,15
Leslie Knope,"Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot.",6,15
Grant Larson,"Well, you wouldn't actually be planting things.",6,15
Grant Larson,"I mean, you're overseeing 200 people.",6,15
Grant Larson,The everyday minutia you would delegate to staff.,6,15
Grant Larson,"Leslie, your job is more creative, big picture stuff.",6,15
Grant Larson,No more boring people working for you.,6,15

Ben Wyatt,You want to see?,6,15
Leslie Knope,"Now that Eagleton and Pawnee have merged, it is time to pick a new town slogan.",6,15
Leslie Knope,And a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town's identity.,6,15

Leslie Knope,"Okay, so people can vote now.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy.",6,15
Leslie Knope,No.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not gonna do that.",6,15
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Um, what?",6,15
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass.",6,15
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?,6,15
Leslie Knope,"We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I did.",6,15
Donna Meagle,So this was one of Eagleton's top sushi restaurants.,6,15
Donna Meagle,But you can't outrun the whale meat police forever.,6,15
Tom Haverford,This is great.,6,15
Tom Haverford,I love it!,6,15
Tom Haverford,"Look at it, I can picture it now.",6,15

Tom Haverford,That's way more that I can afford.,6,15
April Ludgate,Whatever.,6,15
April Ludgate,It's not that great.,6,15
April Ludgate,"Plus, it's really far away from work and that'd be annoying.",6,15
Tom Haverford,It's not a big deal.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"I mean, when it first launches I'll go back and forth, but hopefully it takes off and it'll become a full-time job.",6,15
Donna Meagle,"Come on, I'll show some places in your price range.",6,15

Leslie Knope,"Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here.",6,15
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, your poll is designed to choose a new slogan.",6,15
Perd Hapley,And a slogan is a series of words that have a meaning.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"So true, Perd.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be ""Storied past, bright future.""",6,15
Perd Hapley,"Well, the story of my interest level is: It's medium.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newly merged city a new identity to really rebrand this town.",6,15

Leslie Knope,What?,6,15
Ben Wyatt,Crazy Ira and the Douche got their bonehead radio fans to flood the poll with write-in votes.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,Why did we include a write-in option?,6,15
Leslie Knope,Because every election has a write-in option.,6,15
Leslie Knope,That's how democracy works.,6,15
Leslie Knope,I'm not a dictator.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"I would be a very strong dictator, and you would be my bodyguard, and you would lead my army.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know we should figure out how to fix this.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm starting to get kind of turned on imagining you as a dictator, is that bad?",6,15
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"You know, we could just figure out a different strategy for picking a slogan.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to go on their show.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to do this.",6,15
Leslie Knope,I enjoy the challenge.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"So, how do I look?",6,15
Leslie Knope,"I need these guys to think that I'm, like, super chill.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,Is this gonna work?,6,15

The Douche,How would you rate Emma Watson's boobs?,6,15
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would rate her acting as an ""A.""",6,15
The Douche,You have three seconds to answer or we're gonna withdraw a donation from charity.,6,15

Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be epic!,6,15
Crazy Ira,"Final round, Leslie, boobs or ass?",6,15
Leslie Knope,Hard to believe this is a fan game for your radio listeners.,6,15

The Douche,"We're running out of time here so just a quick reminder to write-in ""Welcome to Douche nation!""",6,15
The Douche,As the official town slogan for pawneecity.gov.,6,15

Ben Wyatt,Let the slogan thing go.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"Or, maybe we sneak back in there you distract those guys for, like, 30, 90 minutes, I get on live radio, I give an impassioned speech about what slogan I want to endorse and I play a few songs, which I always wanted to do, and then we just see what happens.",6,15
Leslie Knope,No.,6,15
Leslie Knope,I should just let this go.,6,15
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, what are you doing?",6,15
Andy Dwyer,That looks like a perfectly good saxophone case.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,What's inside that case?,6,15
Ron Swanson,I am ending my secret musical career.,6,15
Ron Swanson,I have to kill Duke Silver.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,"No, come on, man.",6,15
Andy Dwyer,You're really good.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,You can't quit.,6,15
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, Andrew.",6,15
Ron Swanson,I would rather never play again than have everyone know my secret.,6,15
Ron Swanson,"Goodbye, Duke Silver.",6,15
Ron Swanson,May you restâ¦ in jazz.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom told you are sort of like a computer expert.",6,15
Morris,Uhâ¦ yeah.,6,15
Morris,You can say that.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"These jerks are trying to hijack my online poll, and so far the leading town slogan is, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt.""",6,15
Morris,"Yeah, yeah.",6,15
Morris,I voted for that one.,6,15
Leslie Knope,Great.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"I'm wondering, is there a way I can communicate with everybody who voted?",6,15
Morris,"Yeah, I can do that.",6,15
Morris,Should take about two minutes.,6,15
Morris,Just PayPal me some bitcoins when you get a chance.,6,15
Leslie Knope,What?,6,15
Donna Meagle,"So, this is way under your budget.",6,15
Donna Meagle,Used to be a donut shop.,6,15
Donna Meagle,"Well, a tire shop that sold donuts.",6,15
Tom Haverford,Pretty rough.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I guess I could fix the roof and tear up the counters.",6,15
Tom Haverford,Do something about the smell.,6,15
April Ludgate,This place is creepy.,6,15
April Ludgate,"I mean, I love it, because it reminds me of the cafeteria in a haunted nursing home, but that's just me.",6,15
Donna Meagle,This is the last listing I have that isn't an active crime scene.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, what happened?",6,15
Tom Haverford,I thought Jurassic Fork was super popular.,6,15
Extra,We stretched ourselves too thin by expanding to a second location.,6,15
April Ludgate,You opened another dinosaur themed restaurant?,6,15
Extra,"No, another Steven Spielberg themed restaurant.",6,15
Extra,The German place downtown Schindler's Lunch.,6,15
Tom Haverford,I think you may have misunderstood what people liked about Jurassic Fork.,6,15
Tom Haverford,I actually think the space is pretty cool.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"Obviously, we'd had to move this T-Rex, but--",6,15
Extra,No can do.,6,15
Extra,That's a load-bearing T-Rex.,6,15
Tom Haverford,This is really the last place you have available?,6,15
Tom Haverford,Dang.,6,15
Tom Haverford,Maybe Tom's Bistro wasn't meant to be.,6,15
Leslie Knope,You wanted to see me?,6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, real quick.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,Remember when you said you would close up shop on the slogan thing?,6,15
Leslie Knope,Yes.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,"You did do that, right?",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the ""Stick up the butt"" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?",6,15
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?,6,15
Leslie Knope,What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Well, someone wrote those emails.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,And we got about 300 complaints and as a cherry on top some hackers got really mad about the invasion of privacy and attacked the website.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,Look what they did to Peebo.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,He's wearing a hat made of penises.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Well I.T. is fixing the website, but it will be down for about three days.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"Well, no worries, I will handle all of the overflow work personally.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"Parking tickets, code violations... send them all to me.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?,6,15
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"I spoke to grant about the national parks job, and he mentioned that's mostly big picture planning and delegating, and not very much nitty-gritty, hands on stuff that I love to do.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"I would miss that, very much.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have I really pulled my last bloated raccoon carcass from a public fountain?",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"But that's the whole point of moving up the ladder, you get to think bigger, swim in a bigger pond.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"You're having a public forum on the slogan, right?",6,15
Ben Wyatt,Use it as a test.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Hand the reins to someone else, let them handle things while you manage from a distance.",6,15
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,6,15
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.,6,15
Leslie Knope,I guess I should practice delegating.,6,15
Leslie Knope,Ugh!,6,15
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,15
Leslie Knope,The public forum will be run byâ¦,6,15
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I would not have started the sentence if I knew Larry was the only one here.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, if you can step back and let Larry take control, you can survive anything.",6,15
Leslie Knope,Fine.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"Larry, can you get in here?",6,15
Jerry Gergich,I would love to.,6,15
Jerry Gergich,Gosh darn it.,6,15
Jerry Gergich,II somehow ran my belt through a slat in this chair so I'm kind ofâ¦ I'm kind of stuck to it now.,6,15
Leslie Knope,Great.,6,15
Ron Swanson,You really shouldn't have dug that out of the dumpster.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,I had to.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,Also I had a banana on the way over here.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,"I get why you don't want any more to know about Duke Silver, and you don't have to worry.",6,15
Andy Dwyer,You secret is safe with me.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,"To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets.",6,15
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no, that's not necessary.",6,15
Andy Dwyer,I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,I didn't actually sell my last car.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,I just forgot where I parked it.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,I don't know who Al Gore is.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,And at this point I'm too afraid to ask.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,"When they say 2% milk, I don't know what the other 98% is.",6,15
Andy Dwyer,"When I was a baby, my head was so big scientists did experiments on me.",6,15
Andy Dwyer,"I once threw beer at a swan, and then it attacked my niece Rebecca.",6,15
Ron Swanson,"That'll do, Andrew.",6,15
Andy Dwyer,You don't have to play the unity concert.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,But don't quit music.,6,15
Andy Dwyer,Please.,6,15
April Ludgate,Tommy.,6,15
Tom Haverford,Hey.,6,15
April Ludgate,Are you okay?,6,15
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,6,15
Tom Haverford,I just got excited about the restaurant but I should probably call my investor and tell him we have a problem.,6,15
April Ludgate,"Well, I got you something to cheer you up.",6,15
April Ludgate,Watch cologne.,6,15
Tom Haverford,Cologne for watches.,6,15
Tom Haverford,Thanks.,6,15
Tom Haverford,Things used to make me so happy.,6,15
Tom Haverford,But I've grown a lot in the last year.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"Now I just want one big thing, my own restaurant, named after me, that makes me so much money I can buy anything I want.",6,15
Tom Haverford,I should go.,6,15
April Ludgate,"I didn't want Tom to leave, so I said all these bad things about the restaurant, so he wouldn't like them.",6,15
Donna Meagle,"Damn, we should have coordinated.",6,15
Donna Meagle,I don't want to lose that weird little elf either.,6,15
Donna Meagle,That's why I showed him all those crappy places.,6,15
April Ludgate,"Oh, I thought you were just bad at your job.",6,15
April Ludgate,Sorry.,6,15
April Ludgate,What should we do?,6,15
Donna Meagle,Let me call some people.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone, and welcome to a public forum to choose our new town slogan.",6,15

Jerry Gergich,"I want to talk about-- Oh, it's the-- geez Louise-- This keeps happening.",6,15
Jerry Gergich,I don't know why.,6,15
Chance Frenlm,"I think the slogan should be ""Pawnee, home of crackers, the orangest goldfish in Indiana.""",6,15
Jerry Gergich,Okey-dokey.,6,15
Leslie Knope,No.,6,15
Jerry Gergich,Let me write it down.,6,15
Herman,Who even needs a slogan?,6,15
Jerry Gergich,"Well, now, that is an interesting point.",6,15
Herman,"No, that's my slogan idea.",6,15
Herman,"""Who even needs a slogan?"" And then a big picture of me flipping everybody off.",6,15
The Douche,"Let's keep our eye on the ball here, Douche nation, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt.""",6,15
Crazy Ira,Butt stick! Butt stick! Butt stick!,6,15
The Douche,Let's vote on it right now! Butt stick! Butt stick!,6,15
Jerry Gergich,Okay.,6,15
Jerry Gergich,Who's next?,6,15
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, ma'am.",6,15
Extra,This slogan is gonna go on every sign in town.,6,15
Extra,I think it should be something real that we can all be proud of.,6,15
Extra,"I've lived in Pawnee my whole life and it could be a strange place, but overall it's a warm, and wonderful town.",6,15
Extra,"My idea for a slogan is, ""When you're here, then you're home.""",6,15
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that's lovely.",6,15
Extra,I actually had it printed up so we can see what it would look like.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you-- Hm--there's--that's--that's spelled wrong.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"That should be ""then"", t-h-e-n.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,Stay strong.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,Let them work it out.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,And trust Larry.,6,15
Leslie Knope,Trust Larry?,6,15
Leslie Knope,Are you listening to yourself?,6,15
Extra,I like that slogan a lot.,6,15
Extra,But you made a little mistake there.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,You see?,6,15
Leslie Knope,Back off.,6,15
Extra,"""You're"" is spelled wrong.",6,15
Extra,"It should be ""y-o-u-r.""",6,15
Jerry Gergich,"Oops, I didn't catch it.",6,15
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, she made a possessive.",6,15
Leslie Knope,She's getting further away.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.,6,15
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, let's vote.",6,15

April Ludgate,"I know, crazy, right? Real estate.",6,15
Donna Meagle,"This property is under your budget, and it's got everything on this wish list you gave me.",6,15
Donna Meagle,Except the two helipads.,6,15
Tom Haverford,Does it have one helipad? I don't know.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"I like it, butâ¦ seems a little small.",6,15
April Ludgate,"No, I think it just seems small because of all the heavy furniture.",6,15
April Ludgate,But that part is really great.,6,15
April Ludgate,The lighting is really cool.,6,15
April Ludgate,I think this is the one.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"You know, I think you're right.",6,15
Tom Haverford,I'll do it.,6,15
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, April.",6,15
Tom Haverford,"And, hey, bonus, it's pretty close to city hall.",6,15

Leslie Knope,I held it together for the entire meeting.,6,15
Leslie Knope,Let me have this one.,6,15
Leslie Knope,I'm done micromanaging.,6,15
Leslie Knope,I promise.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,Then I'm sure you are okay with the fact that they installed the sign the wrong way and it's welcoming you to Pawnee as you're leaving.,6,15
Leslie Knope,"What? No! Oh, son of a--",6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you passed the test.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, there's something else I'm worried about.",6,15
Leslie Knope,"The kind of work that I've been doing all these years, the nuts and bolts, the grunt work, that's the stuff I know how to do.",6,15
Leslie Knope,What if I take this national parks jobs and I justâ¦ fail?,6,15
Ben Wyatt,Hm.,6,15
Leslie Knope,What if I'm not good at it?,6,15
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,6,15
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I love you, very much.",6,15
Ben Wyatt,But this is the stupidest thing you've ever said.,6,15

Leslie Knope,"The only thing I am crazy about is a magnificent, pregnant manta ray named Ann Perkins.",6,16
Leslie Knope,I am ranking topics of conversation for our next phone call.,6,16
Leslie Knope,The worst part about your best friend living in another stupid state is the topics really pile up.,6,16
Leslie Knope,What do you think should be higher priority?,6,16
Leslie Knope,Infinity scarves or whether or not it's worth it for me to get Showtime?,6,16
Ben Wyatt,Is this really necessary?,6,16
Leslie Knope,"When she moved, we promised each other that we would talk every day, and we've really fallen behind.",6,16
Ben Wyatt,"I know your female friends are very important to you, but I'm always a good sounding board.",6,16
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I can talk about Sandra Bullock skirt length.",6,16
Leslie Knope,"No, no, babe, you can'tâ¦ you would just embarrass yourself.",6,16

Leslie Knope,Today is that historic day.,6,16
Ron Swanson,Yes.,6,16
Ron Swanson,That is what has happened.,6,16
Ron Swanson,Spending the day outside alone sounds like a dream.,6,16
Ron Swanson,"I love being a father, but there are a few things I miss.",6,16
Ron Swanson,"Silence, the absence of noise, one single moment undisturbed by the sounds of a children's TV program called Doc McStuffins.",6,16
Ron Swanson,There is no quiet anymore.,6,16
Ron Swanson,There is only Doc McStuffins.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,Sorry I'm late.,6,16

Tom Haverford,Is the tent guy lefthanded or righthanded?,6,16
Tom Haverford,I just need to know which way to part my hair to get us a better price.,6,16
Tom Haverford,It's a business theory I'm working on.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,I really don't think it matters.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,Pretty straightforward deal.,6,16
Tom Haverford,A straightforward deal?,6,16
Tom Haverford,Why didn't you tell me?,6,16
Tom Haverford,I don't have my straightforward deal fedora on me.,6,16
Tom Haverford,We gotta stop by my storage unit on the way up.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Larry.",6,16

Ben Wyatt,Little road trip?,6,16
Jerry Gergich,Tent world?,6,16

Tom Haverford,Why'd you invite Larry?,6,16
Ben Wyatt,He's been doing all the paperwork for this deal.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,He deserves to come.,6,16
Tom Haverford,Remember you said that when Larry's farting up the car.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,Larry isn't that bad.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,He's nice.,6,16

Donna Meagle,"She said something came up, she'll call you later.",6,16
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, I told her to leave you a voice mail.",6,16

Leslie Knope,"I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!",6,16
Leslie Knope,I'm coming!,6,16
Ann Perkins,Listen to me very carefully.,6,16
Ann Perkins,I have not been taken.,6,16
Ann Perkins,"I know that's always your first fear when I'm not available, but this is not a Liam Neeson Taken scenario.",6,16
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what they'd make you say.,6,16
Ann Perkins,"Also, no one's making me say this.",6,16
Ann Perkins,"I am a free woman, untaken, simply going about my business.",6,16
Ann Perkins,I just have to run.,6,16

Leslie Knope,I'm setting up an impromptu Galentine's day.,6,16
April Ludgate,Really?,6,16
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,6,16
April Ludgate,"Wait, I thought you weren't gonna do Galentine's day this year because that she-beast moved away.",6,16
April Ludgate,I believe her name was Satan?,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Her name is Ann, and she is gone, and I have accepted it, and we are gonna have Galentine's day.",6,16
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, up front.",6,16
Leslie Knope,"I need an Ann who lives in Pawnee, and there is no one obvious candidate, so I will test them out on the ultimate battlefield of female friendship Galentine's day brunch.",6,16
Leslie Knope,It will be a women's only marathon bonding session with tons of whipped cream.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Side note, do not Google that phrase.",6,16
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ron.",6,16
Andy Dwyer,Can I ask you kind of an important question?,6,16
Andy Dwyer,"You know, like, when you go to the ATM and you get money, is there an actual guy standing behind the wall who slides dollar bills in there?",6,16
Ron Swanson,No.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,It's robots.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, actually, you know what?",6,16
Andy Dwyer,I do have a serious question.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,"In the movie Predator, can you rub any kind of mud on yourself to prevent predator from seeing you with his thermal heat signature sight, or is it more-- Ow!",6,16
Andy Dwyer,That sucks.,6,16
Ron Swanson,Are you hurt?,6,16
Andy Dwyer,No.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,All good.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,All good.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,Oops.,6,16

Andy Dwyer,Five second rule.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,"No, ahh.",6,16
Ron Swanson,"Come on, we better get you to a dentist.",6,16

Tom Haverford,You know what?,6,16
Tom Haverford,Stay out here and double-check these deal memos.,6,16
Tom Haverford,"If you get through 'em, triple-check 'em.",6,16

Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, Pawnee business liaison.",6,16
Harvey,Okay.,6,16
Harvey,Got your contracts for you right here.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,Wow.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,It's a lot thicker than the original one page version.,6,16
Harvey,"I take tents pretty seriously, Ben, I'm a tent guy.",6,16
Harvey,"I got over 1,300 tents in this warehouse alone.",6,16
Harvey,"900 of those are over 2,000 square feet, 80 of them are striped, and exactly 4 of 'em were once rented by Miss Rene Russo.",6,16
Tom Haverford,Whoa!,6,16
Harvey,Yeah.,6,16
Harvey,No doy.,6,16
Harvey,I think I know what I'm doing.,6,16
Harvey,So I added a few syllables and whatnot.,6,16
Harvey,"Clauses, et cetera.",6,16
Harvey,"Addendums, what have you.",6,16
Harvey,Why don't we go ahead and sign that for me?,6,16
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I think we're gonna need to take a look at this.",6,16
Tom Haverford,Hmm.,6,16
Tom Haverford,So I guess this is not a straightforward deal.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Shauna, I'm so glad you could make it.",6,16
Leslie Knope,You're so tan.,6,16
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, thanks.",6,16
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just got back from a solo trip to Rome.,6,16
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I was gonna go with my boyfriend, but he couldn't come because he decided to stay with his wife.",6,16
Leslie Knope,Oof.,6,16
Evelyn,I love Rome.,6,16
Evelyn,It's such a great place.,6,16

Leslie Knope,"A real fixer-upper, but look, it's not like Ann was doing so hot when I met her.",6,16
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.,6,16
Leslie Knope,Bit of a dark horse.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Crotchety, but probably wise.",6,16
Leslie Knope,"And then we got Evelyn, aka fake Ann.",6,16
Leslie Knope,I don't know her last name.,6,16
Leslie Knope,Honestly we just needed bodies.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, everyone, for getting together on such short notice, and happy Galentine's day.",6,16

Jerry Gergich,"Look, I was doublechecking all the paperwork that Tom gave me in that super fun parking lot, and there was something about Harvey's corporate structure that just seemed fishy.",6,16
Jerry Gergich,So I dug around and it turns out he has got a lot of code violations.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!,6,16
Ben Wyatt,"Larry, this is great stuff.",6,16
Tom Haverford,"Never thought I would say it, but I'm a genius for making you stay outside and do a menial task.",6,16

Leslie Knope,"I even tried to rank the women at work, but that was a total bust.",6,16
Ann Perkins,You ranked them?,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought maybe I could use Galentine's day as an opportunity--",6,16
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, Galentine's day?",6,16
Leslie Knope,"What do you want me to do, Ann?",6,16
Leslie Knope,"I need to find a replacement, and don't worry, it didn't work.",6,16
Leslie Knope,Nobody can match your ethnic hybrid energy.,6,16

Leslie Knope,You have all the strengths.,6,16
Ann Perkins,"Look, you love harder than anyone I know.",6,16

Ann Perkins,"And I know Donna and April don't show it, but they would do anything for you.",6,16
Ann Perkins,And it's not like you and I always see eye to eye.,6,16
Ann Perkins,"I mean, Friday Night Lights?",6,16
Ann Perkins,"I am more of a Riggins girl, and you lean Saracen.",6,16
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause Riggins is a criminal.",6,16
Ann Perkins,He took the fall for his brother.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Okay, he didn't watch out for his brother.",6,16
Ann Perkins,"You know, I'm not having this conversation with you again.",6,16
Leslie Knope,That family is garbage.,6,16
Ann Perkins,The point is we didn't always like the same stuff when we first became friends.,6,16
Ann Perkins,Just don't force it.,6,16
Ann Perkins,Give it some time.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"I know, you're right, Ann.",6,16
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"It's just I'm missing you, and there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about.",6,16
Ann Perkins,"Well, you're here now, so let's talk.",6,16
Leslie Knope,Oh.,6,16

Ann Perkins,"Okay, but we should talk soon, 'cause I almost bought a toe ring the other day.",6,16
Leslie Knope,"What? Ann, you're somebody's mother.",6,16
Ann Perkins,I know.,6,16
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,16
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna give you two some time.,6,16
Leslie Knope,I'll call you from the car.,6,16
Ron Swanson,I'll be out here if you need me.,6,16
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks for doing this, Ron.",6,16

Andy Dwyer,"Also, the inside of my mouth is black and hot.",6,16
Andy Dwyer,"So do I strip down to my underwear, or all the way naked?",6,16
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Diane.",6,16
Ron Swanson,"I'm coming home soon to relieve you, give you a little break.",6,16
Ron Swanson,It's no trouble at all.,6,16

Ben Wyatt,"Hello, Harvey.",6,16
Ben Wyatt,We found a glaring number of code violations you've committed.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,I could see to it that you never rent another tent in this region again.,6,16
Harvey,"Gentlemen, I've won two online satellite Jamaican poker tournaments.",6,16
Harvey,I can tell that you're bluffing.,6,16
Tom Haverford,"Your Pawnee business license has lapsed, which negates most of the deals you've made this year.",6,16
Tom Haverford,I'm guessing you're pretty bad at poker.,6,16
Harvey,I am.,6,16
Harvey,And I was bluffing about winning those tournaments.,6,16
Harvey,"Gentlemen, clearly there's been a misunderstanding here.",6,16
Harvey,I'm hoping that we can reach some kind of a compromise.,6,16
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, first off, I need to know where you got these zebra-print pillows.",6,16
Tom Haverford,"Second of all, I got a Tin Cup Blu-Ray itching for a Rene Russo signature.",6,16
Ben Wyatt,Tom.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,The compromise is that you're gonna sign the deal we originally agreed upon.,6,16
Ben Wyatt,"We're going to let you continue renting tents, and you're going to do it at a fair price.",6,16
Ben Wyatt,"And Larry, he's the guy that brought you down, and he's gonna be watching you like a hawk.",6,16
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, hey.",6,16
Jerry Gergich,I'm Larry.,6,16
Jerry Gergich,Great to know you.,6,16
Jerry Gergich,I love tent world.,6,16

Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's about time for my mid-morning mani, so I'm gonna head out.",6,16
Leslie Knope,Okay.,6,16
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's fine.",6,16
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, we'll forge our own unique traditions in the fiery cauldron of female friendship.",6,16
April Ludgate,"I'm just an impartial bunny, but I think Ann sucks.",6,16
April Ludgate,Also-- I'm the zodiac killer.,6,16
Tom Haverford,And we might even be able to pull it off under budget.,6,16
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.,6,16
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, you guys, I'm sorry.",6,16
Jerry Gergich,"I'm trying to find my inhaler, 'cause I'm having a littleâ¦",6,16

Tom Haverford,How many drops?,6,17
Tom Haverford,How dope are the drops?,6,17

Allison,That would be awesome.,6,17
Allison,I definitely need money for school.,6,17

Andy Dwyer,It's just-- it's not good.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,It's not a good movie.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,"Now that I've convinced you, why don't we go dance?",6,17

Music,"This moment, we own it",6,17
Leslie Knope,So have you ever pulled a ceremonial cord before?,6,17
Leslie Knope,There's a little trick to it.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"You want to hold it not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake and then move towards the ground in a rope pulling motion.",6,17
Allison,So just pull the rope?,6,17
Leslie Knope,That's right.,6,17
Allison,"Thanks, Leslie, for this, and for making prom happen in the first place.",6,17
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you don't have to thank me.",6,17
Leslie Knope,Working for the government is its own reward--,6,17
Leslie Knope,"Run, Allison, run.",6,17
Ron Swanson,"You're wasting your time, Leslie.",6,17
Ron Swanson,Allison and I already had a good talk about the power of the hard earned dollar.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Don't listen to him.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"Now, when you pull the rope, don't look at the balloons.",6,17
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces of the people as the balloons drop.,6,17
Leslie Knope,That's what government is about.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces.,6,17
Ron Swanson,"No, look at the cage that is holding all of those balloons.",6,17
Ron Swanson,"I assembled that cage and was paid for my labor, and I will use the money to buy shelter, fuel, and medicine.",6,17
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Pull the rope.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces.,6,17
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces!,6,17
Allison,"Uh, ermâ¦",6,17
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron.",6,17
Leslie Knope,You've ruined prom.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Everybody's having a terrible time.,6,17
Donna Meagle,I didn't go to my prom.,6,17
Donna Meagle,I was dating an older fella back then.,6,17
Donna Meagle,Like I'm gonna dance with a bunch of kids while he's coaching Duke to the final four.,6,17
April Ludgate,"I just want to go home, but I feel bad because Andy's having such a good time.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!,6,17
April Ludgate,How can I love someone when I hate everything he loves?,6,17

Ron Swanson,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,6,17

Ron Swanson,She'll be assistant to the head mulcher.,6,17
Ron Swanson,Beat that.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"First of all, your telephone is ridiculous.",6,17
Leslie Knope,"And second of all, I already beat it.",6,17
Leslie Knope,She's gonna take that internship.,6,17
Leslie Knope,She pulled the rope.,6,17
Leslie Knope,There's no turning back!,6,17
Principal Russell,Leslie.,6,17
Principal Russell,Mr. Swanson.,6,17
Principal Russell,May I see both of you in my office?,6,17
Principal Russell,Now.,6,17
Principal Russell,It has come to my attention that both of you have been harassing Allison about her summer employment decisions.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"I wouldn't say ""harassing"" so much as persistently tormenting.",6,17
Principal Russell,"I am disappointed in you, Leslie.",6,17
Leslie Knope,No!,6,17
Leslie Knope,Don't be disappointed in me.,6,17
Leslie Knope,I've never had a principal or a teacher be disappointed in me.,6,17
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that I'm equipped to handle it.,6,17
Principal Russell,Whatever's going on between you two and Allison ends right now.,6,17
Principal Russell,This is supposed to be a fun event for the kids.,6,17
Ron Swanson,"You're absolutely right, and I will bow out immediately.",6,17
Principal Russell,Thank you.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"I think the only thing that matters is whatever Apluses may or may not have been handed out, you know, are still in effect in perpetuity.",6,17
Principal Russell,"I have your word, then.",6,17
Principal Russell,This ends now?,6,17
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone.",6,17
Leslie Knope,Now it is time for the most magical moment of any high school prom: The announcement of the winner of the Parks and Recreation's coveted summer internship.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, help me congratulate Allison Gliffert!",6,17
Leslie Knope,Can we get a little music here maybe?,6,17
Tom Haverford,Probably just ruin the moment with something lame.,6,17
Allison,"Leslie, I told you.",6,17
Allison,I don't know what I'm doing this summer.,6,17
Leslie Knope,That's okay.,6,17
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.,6,17
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take this internship.,6,17
Leslie Knope,You're gonna fall in love with public service.,6,17
Leslie Knope,You're gonna rise through the ranks.,6,17
Leslie Knope,You'll take over Ron's job as parks director.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"You'll win a seat in congress, and then you and I will run against each other as president, but right before we find out who won, I'm gonna pat you on the back and say, ""It's your turn, kid.""",6,17
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, children.",6,17
Ron Swanson,Forget this happened.,6,17
Ron Swanson,Continue with your awkward close quarters gyrating.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"And if this is the evening you decide to have sex, use protection, please!",6,17
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, if you're not gonna play anything, I'm stepping in.",6,17
Tom Haverford,Go ahead.,6,17
Tom Haverford,Play whatever you want.,6,17
Tom Haverford,Can't be any worse than this.,6,17
Extra,"Hey, I love this song!",6,17
Tom Haverford,You actually like this?,6,17
Extra,"Yeah, dude, it's classic rock.",6,17
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there's more where that came from, snoopies!",6,17
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.,6,17
Ben Wyatt,Tried to use slang.,6,17
Ben Wyatt,That just came out.,6,17
Extra,I only listen to CDs.,6,17
Extra,It's the way music like this was meant to be heard.,6,17
Tom Haverford,But it's not even auto-tuned.,6,17
Extra,Where'd you get that dress?,6,17
April Ludgate,I was buried in it.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, huge news.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,I just got us invited to Damian Keating's barn party.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,"He's captain of the soccer team, and he has a fake I.D.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,So I think he can get us all free beer.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,What's wrong? There's cupcakes and music.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,Why aren't you having fun?,6,17
April Ludgate,"Because this prom reminds me that you had, like, a million friends in high school and everyone thought you were awesome, and I spent four years making fun of everyone and hiding mops so the janitor would think he was going insane.",6,17
April Ludgate,"If we went to high school together, we would have never started dating, which means that we would have never gotten married, and I don't like thinking about that.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, maybe we wouldn't have gotten together if we were in high school.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,But that's because kids in high school are idiots.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,"The only thing that matters is that we found each other right now, and it's the best.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,You know what?,6,17
Andy Dwyer,Let's bail.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,We got that limo for three more hours.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,I think the extra length could help us get us over that lake.,6,17
April Ludgate,No.,6,17
April Ludgate,Let's stay.,6,17
April Ludgate,I'll have fun.,6,17
April Ludgate,I promise.,6,17
Ron Swanson,"I have never told you this, but I actually have a ten-point scale for how insane you are being.",6,17
Ron Swanson,"I observe your behavior, and if it's a five or below, I say nothing.",6,17
Leslie Knope,Smart.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Saves a lot of time.,6,17
Ron Swanson,"If it reaches a six, like for example the incident with the girls' soccer uniforms back in '05â¦",6,17
Leslie Knope,They wrote all the team names in pink.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Nobody told them to do that.,6,17
Ron Swanson,I try to steer you back to safety.,6,17
Ron Swanson,A seven is when I lock you in your office until you cool down.,6,17
Ron Swanson,This Allison Gliffert thing may have hit an eight.,6,17
Ron Swanson,I have the police on standby.,6,17
Ron Swanson,It's your move.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee, moving to Chicago.",6,17
Leslie Knope,I just need to make sure that the future is secure around here when I leave.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"You know? Allison would become April, and then April would become me.",6,17
Leslie Knope,"I mean, let's face it, Ron.",6,17
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but you're hopeless without me.",6,17
Ron Swanson,Blueprints for the future are a fool's errand.,6,17
Ron Swanson,They're like blueprints for a house.,6,17
Ron Swanson,"Nice to have, but any foreman with half a brain doesn't need to look at them.",6,17
Ron Swanson,"One day, this year or maybe the next, you're gonna be somewhere else.",6,17
Ron Swanson,So enjoy yourself now.,6,17
Leslie Knope,Damn it.,6,17
Leslie Knope,I just wish once you would say something stupid so I could ignore it.,6,17
Principal Russell,"Attention, please.",6,17
Principal Russell,The votes are in.,6,17
Principal Russell,And your Pawnee high prom king and queen areâ¦,6,17
Principal Russell,Lucy Taylor and Andy Dwyer!,6,17
Andy Dwyer,What?,6,17
April Ludgate,"I broke the box, and I threw away all the votes, and I voted for you a thousand times.",6,17
April Ludgate,"You should get on up there, King Dwyer.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,Not without my queen.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Pawnee High.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,"As your prom king, I'm your ruler.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,"Silence! My first decree of power is to declare that the prom queen shall be my wife, April Ludgate, who is the best thing that's ever happened to me who came to prom even though she hates it.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,Give me this.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,Always next year.,6,17
Extra,"No, there isn't.",6,17
Extra,I'm a senior.,6,17
Principal Russell,This is your wife? How old are you?,6,17
April Ludgate,"He's 33, and I'm 47/immortal.",6,17
Principal Russell,Get out.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,High school forever!,6,17
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you're having fun now.",6,17
Andy Dwyer,I rigged an election and got kicked out of prom.,6,17
Andy Dwyer,I can get on board with that.,6,17
Tom Haverford,My life is over.,6,17
Tom Haverford,I'm officially old and uncool.,6,17
Tom Haverford,Might as well start wearing a plaid shirt and a tie and khakis and whatever shoes you're wearing.,6,17
Ben Wyatt,"Look, the fact that you don't know what high schoolers are into doesn't make you uncool.",6,17
Ben Wyatt,It makes you a normal human adult.,6,17
Ben Wyatt,"You haven't had time to keep up 'cause the last few years, you started two different businesses.",6,17
Tom Haverford,I guess that's true.,6,17
Tom Haverford,Richard Branson and Mark Cuban are too busy making deals to keep up with what the kids are into.,6,17
Tom Haverford,How else do you explain their terrible haircuts?,6,17
Ben Wyatt,"And, hey, you may be old, but you'll never be as old as me.",6,17
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,6,17
Tom Haverford,You're old as [bleep].,6,17
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ben.",6,17
Ben Wyatt,Glad I could help.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas.",6,17
Leslie Knope,"You just have so much promise, we got excited.",6,17
Leslie Knope,You're a good kid.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it.",6,17
Allison,I have to say I admire you both.,6,17
Allison,"You were right, Leslie.",6,17
Allison,"Watching all those happy faces, it felt amazing.",6,17
Allison,But it was really nice to build something and get paid for it.,6,17
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful and grounded.",6,17
Leslie Knope,"Get her away from me, or I'm gonna kidnap her and try to mentor her to death.",6,17
Allison,"Oh, let me introduce you to my boyfriend.",6,17
Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.,6,17
Greg Pikitis,"What up, Knope?",6,17
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Gregory.",6,17
Allison,You guys know each other?,6,17
Leslie Knope,You might say that.,6,17
Greg Pikitis,"Come on, baby.",6,17
Greg Pikitis,Let's get out of here.,6,17
Ron Swanson,"That's that horrible kid who used to prank us all the time, right?",6,17
Leslie Knope,Offer is off the table.,6,17

April Ludgate,Can't I just stay in the back and spit in people's food like we planned?,6,20
Craig Middlebrooks,Ugh!,6,20

Craig Middlebrooks,"My sinuses are on the Fritz, and smell is 90% of taste, maybe 95%!",6,20
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Craig, Donna's gonna be your wine taster.",6,20
Tom Haverford,You guys will work as a team.,6,20
Donna Meagle,"Fine, but if he raises his voice once, once, I'm out.",6,20
Tom Haverford,Please don't stick to that policy.,6,20
Jerry Gergich,I got the menus.,6,20

Jerry Gergich,"Lord Sheldon has a growth, so we're sending pictures over to the vet.",6,20
Jerry Gergich,"But I guess this isn't good for menus, is it?",6,20
Tom Haverford,"Larry, Larry, Larry, listen to me.",6,20
Tom Haverford,This is the worst thing you've ever done.,6,20
Tom Haverford,I need you to take all of these dog butt pictures and burn them in the pizza oven.,6,20
Tom Haverford,"April, you list all the menu items from memory.",6,20
Tom Haverford,It'll be classier anyway.,6,20
Tom Haverford,Ron!,6,20
Tom Haverford,What was wrong with that one?,6,20
Ron Swanson,It was too perfect.,6,20
Ron Swanson,It looked machine made.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we have to convince 'em that Pawnee is a special city.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, we could tell 'em that there's buried treasure in Pawnee.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"And then after they give us the free wifi, we tell 'em that the treasure was love all along.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,No.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"I am not gonna take ""no"" for an answer.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"If we're leaving Pawnee, I'm gonna give 'em a goingaway present free wifi for all.",6,20

Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you invented that game.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,Are they playing any games I invented?,6,20

Andy Dwyer,"The key is, you have to throw the dirt into the back of the fan.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,How the hell did they-- Excuse me.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,How did you guys get your hands on this game?,6,20
Extra,Someone sent it to us.,6,20

Ben Wyatt,I invented Cones of Dunshire.,6,20
Extra,You're the architect.,6,20
Extra,"Yeah, right, and I'm the Alchemist of the Hinterlands.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,There can't be an Alchemist of the Hinterlands.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,The Hinterlands is a Shadow Kingdom that can only sustain a provost or a denier.,6,20
Mike Bean,He's right.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how about this?",6,20
Ben Wyatt,Let's play.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"If I win, you give me another shot at free wireless for Pawnee.",6,20

Leslie Knope,I think it was a good presentation too.,6,20
Leslie Knope,Is that why you're laughing?,6,20
Extra,Your timeline is way off.,6,20
Extra,I was in charge of the Wesham/Southborough merger of 2004.,6,20
Extra,You know when it was completed?,6,20
Extra,Last month.,6,20
Leslie Knope,What?,6,20
Leslie Knope,How is that possible?,6,20
Extra,Merging governments requires constant hands-on management.,6,20
Extra,You're being very cavalier about the future of your town.,6,20
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"I've been accused of lot of things, but cavalier has never been one of them.",6,20
Leslie Knope,I have a super system.,6,20
Extra,"I had a system too, but the economy went South.",6,20
Extra,My hometown hit some hard times and was converted into unincorporated territory.,6,20
Leslie Knope,You lost your cityhood?,6,20

Leslie Knope,Don't say it.,6,20
Extra,Unincorporated territory.,6,20
Donna Meagle,"It's a bold flavor fruity, a little earthy.",6,20
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, which is it fruity or earthy?",6,20
Craig Middlebrooks,It can't be both.,6,20
Craig Middlebrooks,They're mutually exclusive!,6,20
Donna Meagle,"Oh, no!",6,20

Ron Swanson,No.,6,20
Jerry Gergich,Oh!,6,20
Jerry Gergich,"I am so sorry, Tom.",6,20

Mike Bean,My shaman casts a toyber spell on your prosperity tile.,6,20
Mike Bean,Looks like someone's out of resource gems.,6,20
Mike Bean,Uh-oh.,6,20
Mike Bean,What's so funny?,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no, no, you're a smart guy, clearly picked up some flashy tricks, but you made one crucial mistake.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,You forgot about the essence of the game.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,It's about the Cones.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Move my abbot to the ocean hex, which moves my Brinksman to the Devil's Lair, and pushes my farmer-- yes, my humble farmer-- directly into the central cone.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, man, we did it.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,This whole company is ours.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, it's not.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"That's mine, it's all mine.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Andy... for the record, I did invent this game.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"But it doesn't even matter, because I won and I get another chance to prove that there's something truly special about Pawnee.",6,20
Mike Bean,"Yes, there is.",6,20
Mike Bean,It's the home of the architect.,6,20
Mike Bean,Let's talk.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,I'm on top of the world.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, what are you doing?",6,20
Mitch Savner,Seems like things are a little chaotic.,6,20
Tom Haverford,"No, no, everything is perfect.",6,20
Tom Haverford,This is April.,6,20
Tom Haverford,She's gonna be taking care of you tonight.,6,20

Mitch Savner,Could you repeat that?,6,20
April Ludgate,"Spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, ravioli, Ferrari, Lamborghini, bucatini, lasagna.",6,20
Mitch Savner,Can I see a menu?,6,20
April Ludgate,We had to throw our menus away because they are covered with pictures of Larry's dog rectum.,6,20
Jerry Gergich,Great news.,6,20
Jerry Gergich,Lord Sheldon's gonna make it.,6,20
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, just have to apply a salve to his anus every hour for the rest of his life, butâ¦",6,20

Mitch Savner,For crying out loud!,6,20
Tom Haverford,"No, Mitch, don't leave.",6,20
Tom Haverford,Come on.,6,20
Mitch Savner,You have no idea how to run a restaurant.,6,20
Mitch Savner,I've been in this game before and I can see the cracks starting to form.,6,20
Mitch Savner,"Sorry, kid, consider my investment terminated.",6,20
Mitch Savner,"D, let's go.",6,20
Ron Swanson,"Sir, were you sitting in that chair?",6,20
Mitch Savner,"Yes, yes I was.",6,20
Mitch Savner,Why?,6,20
Ron Swanson,No reason.,6,20
Mitch Savner,Let's go!,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's all over the Internet-- Austin, Charlotte, San Diego.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe.",6,20
Leslie Knope,That's great.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'll look into that, but at least because of it, Pawnee will get free wireless, and we can both move away with a clear conscience.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,Uh-oh.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,What's wrong?,6,20
Leslie Knope,I can't leave Pawnee during a difficult merger that I'm responsible for.,6,20
Leslie Knope,I have to turn down the job.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, no.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,You made up your mind yesterday.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,You-- Michelle Obama.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I've been doing this for months.",6,20
Leslie Knope,The only thing that I am 100% positive on is that I want to stay and go.,6,20
Leslie Knope,I'm never gonna be able to decide.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals until I die here, in this minivan at the San Francisco airport.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,Drive here.,6,20
Ron Swanson,So you screwed up a little.,6,20
Ron Swanson,"You tried to shoot the moon, and you came up short.",6,20
Ron Swanson,That doesn't mean it's over.,6,20
Tom Haverford,My main investor pulled out.,6,20
Tom Haverford,Any dollar I spend from now on is my own.,6,20
Tom Haverford,"And despite what my pocket square says, I'm not a billionaire.",6,20
Tom Haverford,So I quit.,6,20
Tom Haverford,"Just go home, Ron.",6,20
Ron Swanson,I'm not done with the chairs yet.,6,20
Ron Swanson,It is my belief that you never start a job you don't intend to finish.,6,20
Tom Haverford,Really?,6,20
Tom Haverford,I love quitting.,6,20
Tom Haverford,"When I was a kid and things didn't go my way, I would just take my ball and go home.",6,20
Tom Haverford,"That's better than winning, 'cause then your friends can't play anymore.",6,20
April Ludgate,Hey!,6,20
Tom Haverford,"No, my stemware!",6,20
April Ludgate,You are not quitting.,6,20
April Ludgate,"I just called a bunch of reviewers, and I told them that the soft opening went great, and I invited them to come here on Friday.",6,20
Tom Haverford,Why would you do this to me?,6,20
April Ludgate,You worked really hard.,6,20
April Ludgate,"You owe it to yourself to give it a real shot, because you are smart and talented.",6,20
Tom Haverford,"Well, I hate doing work, but I love being flattered, so maybe I'll give it another try.",6,20
April Ludgate,Good.,6,20
Ron Swanson,"It's a smart move, son.",6,20
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron.",6,20
Ron Swanson,"Because you currently owe me $16,000 for the wood.",6,20
Tom Haverford,What?,6,20
Leslie Knope,Where are we going?,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's right up here.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,Just trust me.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,Wait.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,I'm on Endor.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,These are the redwoods George Lucas used to create the forest moon of Endor.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,That's not why we're here.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a gorgeous view.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it is.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,But don't look at that.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,Look at this.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,You've been thinking about this job in the abstract.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,Focus on what it actually means.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,We're standing in a national park that stretches 50 miles.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,That's the Presidio over there.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,It's a national park.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"So is Alcatraz, and so are the redwoods we just walked through, by the way.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"You take this job, places like this will be your office.",6,20
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a compelling point.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"When we got back from London, you said that it's a very big world and you've seen very little of it.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"This is your chance, honey.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"This whole region-- Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, the Ozarks, Abe Lincoln's childhood home you would be in charge of all of it.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,Your job would be to preserve the most beautiful places on earth so millions of people could enjoy them.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"And those places, the greatest treasures America has to offer, will all have signs with your name right there.",6,20
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Grant.",6,20
Leslie Knope,I want the job.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of questions, but I'm a little amped up right now, so I'll probably just hang up.",6,20
Leslie Knope,It might be for the best.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"But, anyway, I love you.",6,20
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't.",6,20
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,6,20
Leslie Knope,That was weird.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye.",6,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is Lester Kanopf.",6,20
Leslie Knope,"No, you know who it--",6,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Smoothly handled, Lester.",6,20
Leslie Knope,I panicked.,6,20
Leslie Knope,We should go.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of stuff to do and the meter's still running on that cab, so chop chop.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,Really?,6,20
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,6,20
Ben Wyatt,Oh.,6,20
Tom Haverford,The opening of Tom's Bistro was a disaster.,6,20
Tom Haverford,So what?,6,20
Tom Haverford,This is America.,6,20
Tom Haverford,"And America's the land of second chances, and now we have one night, one afterparty to make the world realize that Tom's Bistro is where miracles can happen!",6,20
Craig Middlebrooks,"Thomas, I have to work all day at the Unity concert.",6,20
Craig Middlebrooks,"If you're gonna pull this off, we need more people.",6,20

Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, if that's where the night is goingâ¦",6,20
Tom Haverford,It's 9:00 in the morningâ¦,6,20
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Wha--,6,20
Tom Haverford,It's not a fourway.,6,20
Tom Haverford,And I need your help.,6,20
Tom Haverford,Take these V.I.P. invitations.,6,20
Tom Haverford,"Find all the ""A"" list peeps at the concert and get 'em to the restaurant tonight.",6,20
Tom Haverford,I got to stop by the Parks office.,6,20
Tom Haverford,I'll meet you later.,6,20
Tom Haverford,Godspeed.,6,20
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I like your energy, hombre.",6,20
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What do you say you and I ride gokarts later?,6,20
Craig Middlebrooks,I want to go horseback riding!,6,20
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Deal.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Last chance, Ron.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister Duke Silver wanted to come out.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun.",6,20
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times.",6,20
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting.",6,20
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you are in charge.",6,20

April Ludgate,Their first project will be to come up with a shorter name for the group.,6,20
Leslie Knope,You're right.,6,20
Leslie Knope,The name is too long.,6,20
Leslie Knope,I was picturing bigger hats.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Everybody, let's get to work.",6,20
Leslie Knope,Can the Parks and Rec people hang back for a second?,6,20
Leslie Knope,"Um The reason I wanted you guys to stick around is, I wanted to tell youâ¦",6,20
Leslie Knope,That I love and admire you.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,Oh!,6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, thank you.",6,20
April Ludgate,You say that every morning.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"A while ago, I was offered a job at the national parks service, and it's a great opportunity, but it means that I'll have to move to Illinois.",6,20
Leslie Knope,And I took the job.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,Good for you!,6,20
Jerry Gergich,Wow!,6,20
Andy Dwyer,That's great!,6,20
Ron Swanson,"Congratulations, Knope.",6,20

Donna Meagle,When do you leave?,6,20
Ben Wyatt,"Soon, maybe a month.",6,20
Tom Haverford,Oh.,6,20
Tom Haverford,That makes what we're about to show you a little bit awkward.,6,20
Tom Haverford,We had a new founders day statue commissioned and added your name to the list of founders of Pawnee.,6,20
April Ludgate,Because you basically founded this new town.,6,20

Leslie Knope,I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, don't cry.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,It's not that great.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,It doesn't even look like you.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Or, actually, you know what?",6,20
Andy Dwyer,It kind of does.,6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it's about that time.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,Unity concert!,6,20

Grant Larson,Four of them will be coming up from Omaha.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so does that mean that there's two openings left?",6,20

Ginuwine,Who is this guy?,6,20

Leslie Knope,"You know what, excuse me for wanting my dear friend and ethical mentor to accompany me on the adventure of a lifetime.",6,20

Leslie Knope,"It's the best option, hands down.",6,20
Grant Larson,"Well, I'll run this up the flagpole.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Also, can you bring back Power Rangers?",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what it is you do, but you seem important enough to get that done.",6,20
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise.,6,20
Leslie Knope,I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow.,6,20
Leslie Knope,But it is really how I feel today.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving, but the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility.",6,20
Leslie Knope,So I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"Call Ken and Rebecca, and no statements to the press unless I personally release them.",6,20
Leslie Knope,We are on a media lockdown.,6,20

Ben Wyatt,Let's just go hear what they have to say.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"But honey, tonight's your big night.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,"No, this is more important.",6,20
Ben Wyatt,Where are the kids?,6,20
April Ludgate,Right here.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys! Mommy and daddy had to do a little work, and you're gonna have a fun play date with Uncle Andy and Aunty April, okay?",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"Let's go, munchkins.",6,20
Andy Dwyer,"I forgot, Ben how many bags of marshmallows do I give them?",6,20
Ben Wyatt,None! Just let April do everything.,6,20
Leslie Knope,"One day, in the distant future, things will be calm and normal, right?",6,20

Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no, you haven't though.",7,1
Jessica Wicks,But I also like money.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,And money pays for my lifestyle.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,Leslie doesn't pay for my lifestyle.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,Money does.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,"So, between money and Leslie... You see the bind that I'm in?",7,1
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,7,1
Leslie Knope,It's a tough one.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you, Jessica.",7,1
Leslie Knope,You did and said exactly what I thought you were gonna do and say.,7,1
Leslie Knope,And that's oddly comforting.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,"Thank you, sweetie!",7,1
Tom Haverford,Who is Tom Haverford?,7,1
Tom Haverford,"He's a mentor, a lover, a hero.",7,1

Tom Haverford,Write this all down.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,"So, for the introduction, I'd love it if you could just keep it brief.",7,1
Ben Wyatt,Like stick to my fiscal accomplishments.,7,1
Tom Haverford,"Wanna wake me up when you're done boring us to death, am I right, Janet?",7,1

Ben Wyatt,I'm being honored at a gala tonight because I'm in charge of the Pawnee Bicentennial Celebration.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,"It's my biggest project since Ice Town, so it really means a lot that I'm being recognized as a city leader instead of being yelled at and pelted with things.",7,1
Ben Wyatt,Wait.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,"You don't think this is all an elaborate setup to pelt me with things, do you?",7,1
April Ludgate,"It takes, like, eight hours to cook something in this thing.",7,1
April Ludgate,I guess I could pick up a brisket tomorrow and start it for dinner Thursday.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Thursday's no good.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,I have production meetings all day.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,I think we've got dinner with Joe and Donna on Friday.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know, Sunday, we can go to the farmer's market, put the brisket in the slow cooker, get a movie on Pay Per View.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,The new Jason Bourne movie is supposed to be pretty funny.,7,1
April Ludgate,"Andy, we're planning our whole week, like old people!",7,1
April Ludgate,We used to be spontaneous and weird.,7,1
April Ludgate,We used to eat cereal out of Frisbees because we didn't have any bowls.,7,1
April Ludgate,You once broke a rib trying to wrestle one of those inflatable floppy guys at a car dealership.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,I won.,7,1
April Ludgate,Now you sprained your shoulder trying to clean out the stupid gutter.,7,1
April Ludgate,You even have a job.,7,1
April Ludgate,We have a bank account!,7,1
April Ludgate,That's it.,7,1
April Ludgate,"We've held out as long as we could, but it finally happened.",7,1

Ben Wyatt,Whoa!,7,1
Ben Wyatt,90 million dollars?,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, I only have 2 million dollars in the discretionary fund, and I've already used some of it to make Thomas Jefferson sexier in those Mount Rushmore promotions.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, attendance has been up.",7,1
Leslie Knope,That's not a coincidence.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee's rich and famous will all be here tonight.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you start there.,7,1
Leslie Knope,That is a very smart idea.,7,1
Leslie Knope,And that tuxedo makes you look like a sexy orchestra conductor.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Here.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Wave this pen around.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,Focus.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Fine.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Let's go get that park.,7,1

Ken Hotate,My son sells them on Etsy.,7,1
Ken Hotate,He is a huge disappointment.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, now that we're chatting, the National Park Service is looking to buy the Newport Land, but we're a little short on funds.",7,1
Ken Hotate,How short?,7,1
Leslie Knope,88 million dollars.,7,1
Leslie Knope,What do you say you put some of that casino money to good use?,7,1
Ken Hotate,"You know, we have been considering opening a second resort.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"No, it would be a donation.",7,1
Leslie Knope,The government would keep the land.,7,1
Ken Hotate,So you would like the Wamapoke people to pay the federal government millions of dollars to buy land that was stolen from us by the federal government?,7,1
Ken Hotate,And we don't even get to keep the land?,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, when you put it like that, I see the irony.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"So, are you in?",7,1
Leslie Knope,No?,7,1
Leslie Knope,What if I buy some of your disappointing son's bolo ties?,7,1
Leslie Knope,Damn it.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,"I'm so crazy and spontaneous, I don't even need this sling anymore.",7,1
April Ludgate,Yes.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Oh.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that pop?,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that?,7,1
Andy Dwyer,You wanna do shots?,7,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'd love to do a shot.",7,1
April Ludgate,'Cause wine makes me sleepy now.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,This is gonna be fun.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,What do you wanna do first?,7,1
April Ludgate,I dare you to eat this entire jug of olives.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Done.,7,1
April Ludgate,What are you doing?,7,1
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna take a Zantac.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,All that salt will give me heartburn.,7,1
April Ludgate,"Oh, God.",7,1
April Ludgate,You ruined it.,7,1
April Ludgate,We have to figure something else out.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Should I still take the Zantac?,7,1
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you always feel better when you do.",7,1
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God.",7,1
April Ludgate,"I hate us, let's go.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know all of you are off doing your own things, and we don't see each other as much as we used to, but I need my old team back for one last mission.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"So, hands in, ""Defeat Ron"" on three!",7,1
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three.",7,1
Tom Haverford,"Oh, actually, Ron promised me I could build a restaurant on the new Gryzzl campus.",7,1
Tom Haverford,So I'm kind of totally on Ron's side.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom's dead to me.",7,1
Leslie Knope,Donna?,7,1
Leslie Knope,I'm waiting for your hand.,7,1
Donna Meagle,Yeah.,7,1
Donna Meagle,Ron hired Regal Meagle Realty to broker the deal.,7,1
Donna Meagle,And I'm gonna need the money for my wedding.,7,1
Donna Meagle,Shia LaBeouf designed wedding dresses do not come cheap.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",7,1
Leslie Knope,You're getting married?,7,1
Leslie Knope,That's amazing!,7,1
Leslie Knope,And you didn't tell me earlier.,7,1
Leslie Knope,How could you?,7,1
Donna Meagle,Joe popped the question a few days ago.,7,1
Donna Meagle,I didn't post anything on Gryzzl Feed 'cause I wanted to tell you in person.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"It's very beautiful, and I'm furious at you.",7,1
Donna Meagle,How are you?,7,1
Donna Meagle,How are the kids?,7,1
Leslie Knope,They're great.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"You know, they're trying to destroy us.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"There's three of them, it's insane, but they're great.",7,1
Tom Haverford,"We gotta run, Les.",7,1
Tom Haverford,Sorry for totally crushing it and you in the process.,7,1
Tom Haverford,Later.,7,1
Jerry Gergich,"Well, never fear, because Terry is here.",7,1
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, I go by Terry now.",7,1
Jerry Gergich,Because there was a guy at National Parks.,7,1
Jerry Gergich,"He was already named Larry, so they suggested I go by Terry.",7,1
Jerry Gergich,"And then I said my real name is Gary, and they said, ""Who cares?""",7,1
Jerry Gergich,"So, it's just a fun group.",7,1
Tom Haverford,Good evening and welcome to the Pawnee Bicentennial Gala.,7,1
Tom Haverford,"Not long ago, this town was barely on the map.",7,1
Tom Haverford,Unless you're talking about a map of the cities with the most obese pets.,7,1
Tom Haverford,But then one great man came along and he lifted all of us up.,7,1
Tom Haverford,And that man was me.,7,1
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, owner and proprietor of the effortlessly chic, celebrity packed Italian restaurant, Tom's Bistro.",7,1
Tom Haverford,And several other establishments.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how could you?",7,1
Ron Swanson,I simply took a skewer for one shrimp and added many shrimp to it.,7,1
Ron Swanson,They're long enough for five or six.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"First you try to steal my park, and now you steal my team?",7,1
Ron Swanson,I didn't steal them.,7,1
Ron Swanson,"They're independent people who have moved on to better things, just like you did.",7,1
Ron Swanson,Bacon wrapped shrimp?,7,1
Ron Swanson,I fit seven on this one.,7,1
Ron Swanson,It's a masterpiece.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Why don't you shove them all in your dumb mouth and then when I turn around, you can stab me in the back with the skewer?",7,1
Tom Haverford,"People come up to me, and they say things like, ""Tom, given all that you've accomplished, is it hard to stay humble?""",7,1
Tom Haverford,"And I say, ""Not for me.""",7,1
Tom Haverford,"""I'm pretty amazing at being humble.""",7,1
Tom Haverford,But enough about me.,7,1
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Pawnee's Man of the Year 2017, Mr. Ben Wyatt.",7,1

Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh I guess it's time for cake?",7,1
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,Great.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,Perfect timing.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,How about this?,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"We shut off the lights, turn 'em back on.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,Everybody's fancy jewelry is missing.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"Meanwhile, you and I are already on a boat to the airport.",7,1
April Ludgate,Let's put stink bombs in all the vents.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Yes.,7,1
April Ludgate,Wait.,7,1
April Ludgate,No.,7,1
April Ludgate,I forgot.,7,1
April Ludgate,I got rid of all the stink bombs before I babysat Leslie's kids.,7,1
April Ludgate,Being responsible adults sucks butts.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Butts.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,That's it.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,I'll streak across the stage.,7,1
April Ludgate,Yes.,7,1
April Ludgate,I love it.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get naked.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get up there.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Everyone is gonna see my wiener.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you've seen it.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,You know how dumb it looks.,7,1
April Ludgate,Uh-huh.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Perfect plan.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Why are you even here?,7,1
Leslie Knope,What have you ever done for this city?,7,1
Ron Swanson,My company has stimulated Pawnee's economy.,7,1
Ron Swanson,You're just still upset about Morningstar.,7,1
Leslie Knope,I told you to never say that word to me!,7,1
Leslie Knope,No one should ever say that word out loud.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"It's like ""Voldemort"" or ""Ron.""",7,1
Leslie Knope,You know what?,7,1
Leslie Knope,You don't deserve that candle!,7,1
Leslie Knope,Give me that candle!,7,1
Ron Swanson,Let go!,7,1
Ron Swanson,Let go!,7,1
Leslie Knope,This candle's mine!,7,1
Leslie Knope,No!,7,1
Leslie Knope,Gimme this candle.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"You steal my team, I steal your candle!",7,1
Ron Swanson,I stole nothing!,7,1
Ben Wyatt,Guys!,7,1
Leslie Knope,I want it!,7,1
Ron Swanson,Leslie!,7,1
Leslie Knope,Stop!,7,1
Leslie Knope,It's okay.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Just wheel out the backup cake.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,There's no backup cake.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Who doesn't bake a backup cake?,7,1
April Ludgate,Okay.,7,1
April Ludgate,"Well, that seals it.",7,1
April Ludgate,Even Leslie is crazier than we are.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"They're still gonna serve that cake, right?",7,1
Tom Haverford,"And then I said, ""Uh, you might wanna check with the penguin.""",7,1
Trevor Nelson,I get it.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,You Gryzzl guys are a real hoot.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,And you have so much money.,7,1
Mike Bean,"Thanks, Jessie!",7,1
Mike Bean,"And, hey, enjoy that new prototype Gryzzl Tablet.",7,1
Jessica Wicks,I will.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,I just love it!,7,1
Extra,"Thank you, Jessica.",7,1
Extra,"I love you, too.",7,1
Extra,I love your skin.,7,1
Extra,Give me your skin.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,Oh!,7,1
Mike Bean,There are still a couple bugs with the Al software.,7,1
Mike Bean,But maybe just turn it off before you go to sleep.,7,1
Tom Haverford,"All right, Donna.",7,1
Tom Haverford,Let's hit it.,7,1
Tom Haverford,About to get some peddies!,7,1
Donna Meagle,Peddies on peddies on peddies.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,Okay.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,You're next.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ron.",7,1
Leslie Knope,I just want you to know that I am not sorry that I pushed you into a giant cake.,7,1
Ron Swanson,"Well, I am sorry that I attended a public event.",7,1
Mike Bean,"Yo, Ron.",7,1
Mike Bean,"Come on, bud.",7,1
Mike Bean,"We're gonna go play some video games, and we want you to watch quietly.",7,1
April Ludgate,"After we drop off the renters insurance forms, we need to stop by the grocery store.",7,1
April Ludgate,And then we need to sign a suicide pact because our lives are meaningless.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, we are not boring people.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,"Would boring people get renters insurance, even though it's not legally required?",7,1
Andy Dwyer,Where are we? I have never once been to this part of Pawnee.,7,1
April Ludgate,It's the creepy warehouse district.,7,1
April Ludgate,It's mostly just raccoons and old car batteries.,7,1
April Ludgate,Whoa! Hang on.,7,1
April Ludgate,Pull over.,7,1
April Ludgate,Look at that.,7,1
April Ludgate,This place is amazing.,7,1
April Ludgate,Let's go in!,7,1
Tom Haverford,"What up, playa? I just wanted to apologize for my intro running long.",7,1
Tom Haverford,"But, you know, when it comes to inspirational Will Smith quotes, how you gonna stop at 10?",7,1
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when the Chamber of Commerce asked you to introduce me, I was a little worried you would spend the entire time talking about yourself, which is exactly what you did.",7,1
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.,7,1
Tom Haverford,Truth is they didn't ask me to introduce you.,7,1
Tom Haverford,I asked them if I could do it.,7,1
Tom Haverford,"I was gonna talk about how I owe you so much, and how you stood by me through all of my failures, and I stood by you through all of your terrible outfits.",7,1
Tom Haverford,"But when I got up there, I got pretty emotional.",7,1
Tom Haverford,"To make it up to you, I'd like to read you the speech now.",7,1
Tom Haverford,"""I've known a lot of ballers in my day.""",7,1
Tom Haverford,"""But no man balls harder than the man I'm about to bring up.""",7,1
Tom Haverford,"""He's kind.""",7,1
Tom Haverford,"""He's intelligent.""",7,1
Tom Haverford,"""He's a person I'm deeply proud to call my friend.""",7,1
Ben Wyatt,It was a pretty good speech.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it was a little sappy maybe.",7,1
Ben Wyatt,But I think I liked it.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, Mr. Nelson, you are going to hear a lot of bids today.",7,1
Leslie Knope,But this is the only one that matters.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,Is this a circle? Or is it an O?,7,1
Jessica Wicks,Is Oprah involved in your bid?,7,1
Leslie Knope,It's a zero.,7,1
Leslie Knope,I bid zero dollars.,7,1
Trevor Nelson,"I have to say, that's one of the lower ones we've seen.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is celebrating its 200th anniversary, and the Newport family has been here since day one.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"Through feast and famine, transformation, upheaval, celebration.",7,1
Leslie Knope,The Newport family is part of the fabric of this town.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"And not always in a good way, like when your hot fudge pipeline exploded.",7,1
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, boo-hoo! It all ran off into the lake.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, admittedly, it did make the fish taste delicious, but it was a PR nightmare.",7,1
Jessica Wicks,Mmm-hmm.,7,1
Leslie Knope,My question is this.,7,1
Leslie Knope,What do you want the Newport name to mean in the future?,7,1
Leslie Knope,"If you donate this land, and you let me turn it into a national park, the Newport National Park, your name will stand for something good for generations to come.",7,1
Jessica Wicks,How much was her bid again?,7,1
Trevor Nelson,It was zero dollars.,7,1
Jessica Wicks,Oh! That's the part I don't like.,7,1
Trevor Nelson,Yeah.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Just keep me in the running.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Give me a chance to prove to you how great this could be.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"It says here there are 12 closets, three bomb shelters, five dumbwaiters, two and three-eighths baths, no kitchens.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,It's a fairly standard layout.,7,1
April Ludgate,Cool.,7,1
April Ludgate,Is that a staircase to nowhere?,7,1
Extra,"Yes, it is.",7,1
Extra,Good eye.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,What was this place?,7,1
Extra,Remember the Pawnee Doll Head Factory?,7,1
April Ludgate,This was a doll head factory?,7,1
Extra,No.,7,1
Extra,This was a holding cell for people who went insane on the assembly line.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,What's behind this door?,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Fire pole!,7,1
April Ludgate,So this place has had zero offers?,7,1
Extra,"People seem to be scared off, on account of it being haunted and disgusting.",7,1
Extra,"After 47 years living here, I decided to move to Orlando to be closer to Disney World.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,We are responsible adults.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,You know what that means?,7,1
April Ludgate,I know.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,We have money.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,And we are going to buy the [bleep] out of this house!,7,1
April Ludgate,Seriously?,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Yes.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Who needs rental insurance? We're gonna live here.,7,1
Extra,We now go live to the press conference.,7,1
Trevor Nelson,Good evening.,7,1
Trevor Nelson,"I'm Attorney Trevor Nelsson with the law firm Fwar, Dips, Winshares, Gritt, Babip, Pecota, Vorp and Eckstein, legal counsel to the Newport family, here to announce that the Newport Family Trust has narrowed this search to two final candidates, the Gryzzl corporation and the National Park Service.",7,1
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,1
Leslie Knope,I'm in the game.,7,1
Leslie Knope,All I have to do is convince them that it's better taking no money than taking 90 million dollars.,7,1
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you did convince three unsuspecting toddlers that peas turn into cupcakes in their tummies.",7,1
Leslie Knope,I started my career in Pawnee by turning a pit into a cool little park.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"And now I have the chance to give this town a massive, beautiful gift that they can use forever.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"In the words of Jason Bourne, ""This is where it started for me.""",7,1
Leslie Knope,"""This is where it ends.""",7,1
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I still think Kevin James was a weird choice for the reboot.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't.",7,1
Leslie Knope,I think he nailed it.,7,1
Tom Haverford,"So, I'm thinking, in addition, to the Tom's Bistros, we have a hyper exclusive lounge area called Tommy's Lounge.",7,1
Leslie Knope,Attention! This is war.,7,1
Leslie Knope,You guys are going down.,7,1
Leslie Knope,And that's all I wanted to say.,7,1
Leslie Knope,"Except Donna, Tom, hey.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I haven't kept in better touch with you recently, but, you know, I've been a little preoccupied with my kids and my job.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really good to see you both.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"And also, prepare for war because you chose the wrong side and we are gonna smoke you.",7,1
Leslie Knope,"And also I made cookies, but Ron is not allowed to eat them and they say, ""Prepare for War"" on them, but the O in the word ""for"" is a heart.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,And I ate a lot of 'em on the way over here.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,Because we're at war.,7,1
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Tom!",7,1
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man!",7,1
Andy Dwyer,"Buddy, good to see you.",7,1
Andy Dwyer,How's it going?,7,1
Tom Haverford,It's pretty good.,7,1
Leslie Knope,Hey! Andy! Let's go.,7,1
Leslie Knope,War!,7,1

Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jeremy.",7,2
Leslie Knope,I truly thought that I would never have to interact with you again.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,"I missed you, too.",7,2
Leslie Knope,The city council is voting on whether to rezone the Newport land for commercial use.,7,2
Leslie Knope,"If I win, stupid Gryzzl and stupid Ron can't build anything there, and then I'm sitting pretty.",7,2
Leslie Knope,"Sadly, the deciding vote is from my old city council mate, and human equivalent of gas station sushi, Jeremy Jamm.",7,2
Leslie Knope,"So, I am here to talk to you about why you should vote ""No"" in the zoning issue.",7,2
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,"Hold up, little chica.",7,2
Jeremy Jamm,"Before we go any further, I need to ask my girlfriend how she wants me to vote.",7,2

Jeremy Jamm,Hit it off at karaoke.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,"She saw me nail Gangsta's Paradise, I saw her bite the door guy.",7,2
Jeremy Jamm,She then let me buy her a bunch of purses.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,And the rest is history.,7,2
Tammy 2,A bunch.,7,2
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.,7,2
Leslie Knope,This is great news.,7,2
Leslie Knope,Because Ron is my opponent in this.,7,2
Leslie Knope,And you live to torture Ron.,7,2
Leslie Knope,Vote for me so that you can screw Ron over.,7,2
Tammy 2,Maybe you're not a blonde bimbo after all.,7,2
Leslie Knope,Thank you.,7,2
Tammy 2,Well.,7,2
Tammy 2,Let me mull it over.,7,2
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'm aligning myself with terrible people, but think of all the wonderful people who will benefit from a national park.",7,2
Leslie Knope,It's worth it.,7,2
Leslie Knope,"And you can trust my opinion because I have a lot to gain by being right, and I have severe tunnel vision about achieving my goals.",7,2
Ben Wyatt,"Joan, on behalf of the entire city, congratulations.",7,2
Ben Wyatt,I do want to apologize for not being able to accommodate some of your requests.,7,2
Ben Wyatt,"For example, we couldn't get a bottle of Chateau Marmont because it's a hotel in Los Angeles, not a wine.",7,2
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, did you at least get Buddy Holly to sing?",7,2
Ben Wyatt,"No, because he's been famously dead for 60 years.",7,2
Joan Callamezzo,What?,7,2
April Ludgate,"Hi, Joan.",7,2
April Ludgate,"Hi, my name is April.",7,2
April Ludgate,And I'm your biggest fan and I pretty much hate everyone.,7,2

Ron Swanson,"What is this, revenge for Morningstar?",7,2
Leslie Knope,"No, it is not about that.",7,2
Leslie Knope,It's not about the vote.,7,2
Leslie Knope,There is a guy in real trouble and you might be the only one who can help him.,7,2
Leslie Knope,This is about saving someone's soul.,7,2

Ron Swanson,I will give you this gold bar if you say one unflattering thing about Tammy.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,"If I do, does Tammy get to keep the gold?",7,2
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!",7,2
Ron Swanson,"When it comes to Tammy, the code is the same as that of the battlefield.",7,2
Ron Swanson,"First, you leave no man behind.",7,2
Ron Swanson,"Second, you must protect yourself against chemical warfare.",7,2
Ron Swanson,Tammy does not abide by the Geneva Convention.,7,2
Ron Swanson,I made this Tammy deprogramming kit in case I ever fell victim to her again.,7,2
Ron Swanson,"First, this is a chastity belt that I made by hand.",7,2
Ron Swanson,"It might be a couple sizes too big for you, but you can just pad it.",7,2
Ron Swanson,The first step is to cut out all sex.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,That won't be necessary.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,We haven't done the deed yet.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,She lets me rub up against her leg sometimes.,7,2
Ron Swanson,"Well, all the more reason to wear it.",7,2
Ron Swanson,"She knows she has that card left to play, and you best believe she will.",7,2

April Ludgate,Why?,7,2
April Ludgate,How did you become a mortician?,7,2
April Ludgate,Can't I just sign up?,7,2
Dan,"Oh, gosh, no!",7,2
Dan,You need two years of school and a year long apprenticeship.,7,2
Dan,The first few years are mostly paperwork and filing.,7,2
April Ludgate,Why is every job just paperwork?,7,2
Dan,"Hey, it's a living.",7,2
April Ludgate,Yeah.,7,2
April Ludgate,"I think we're gonna go, Dan.",7,2
April Ludgate,The reality of your life is incredibly depressing.,7,2

Jeremy Jamm,Do it.,7,2
Ron Swanson,"There will be no sex today, Tammy.",7,2
Leslie Knope,Oh!,7,2

Ben Wyatt,"And I want you to be happy, because you're my friend.",7,2
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not.",7,2
April Ludgate,I've never cared for you.,7,2

Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Brokemons.",7,2
Jeremy Jamm,I just wanted to let you know that I will be abstaining from the vote today.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,You are my two all-time best friends.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,And you brought me back from the brink.,7,2
Jeremy Jamm,"So, I can't choose sides.",7,2
Jeremy Jamm,"Although, if I had to pick one side, it would be Lucy Liu's backside.",7,2
Leslie Knope,"Without Jamm, the vote's two-two.",7,2
Leslie Knope,This was all for nothing.,7,2
Ron Swanson,I thought it was very big of you to not bend when Tammy promised you the vote.,7,2
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought it was very big of you to help him at all.",7,2
Leslie Knope,You didn't have to do that.,7,2
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,2

Tom Haverford,You're smart and qualified and we're totally lucky to have you.,7,2
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's do this.",7,2
Tom Haverford,"I still don't know what ""claiming allowances"" means.",7,2
Tom Haverford,I always just put six.,7,2
Tom Haverford,"So far, so good.",7,2
Lucy,"Dude, you are totally going to jail.",7,2

Leslie Knope,"So, gentlemen, you have evidence that the Newport land should be preserved.",7,3
Extra,Absolutely.,7,3
Extra,"You see, I'm a ninth level octopriest in the Church of the Reasonableists.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy.",7,3
Extra,The land is sacred in our religion because it's the place where all human souls will be transmuted when Zorp the Lizard God passes through Jupiter's Sphincter.,7,3
April Ludgate,Hail Zorp.,7,3
Extra,Hail Zorp.,7,3
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for anything to strengthen my case that the Newport land should become a park and not a corporate campus.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Religious reasons, animal conservation, historical significance.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Anything.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"So, hold onto your straws, everybody, because Mama's going grasping.",7,3
Manrico Della Rossa,"In 1980, there were more than 600 million Indiana Brown Ants in that forest.",7,3
Manrico Della Rossa,"Today, there are only 595 million.",7,3
Manrico Della Rossa,"At that rate, they'll all be gone by the year 203060.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Two hundred and three thousand and sixty?,7,3
Leslie Knope,Two hundred thousand years from now?,7,3
Manrico Della Rossa,Yes.,7,3
Leslie Knope,That doesn't seem like an immediate crisis.,7,3
Herman,I've got a different idea for that land.,7,3
Herman,An amusement park with rides and food and sexy cartoon characters.,7,3
Herman,I call it Disneyland.,7,3
Leslie Knope,How did you get in here?,7,3
Herman,Broke a window.,7,3

Roscoe,"You guys, I am Roscoe.",7,3
Roscoe,I am Vice President of Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.,7,3
Roscoe,Feel free in this meeting to break out your vapes and just kick back.,7,3
Roscoe,"Now, peep this.",7,3
Roscoe,Leslie Knope has been meeting with people to try to sexy up her presentation.,7,3
Roscoe,"So, we had this far out brain tornado.",7,3
Tom Haverford,Good idea.,7,3
Roscoe,"We should get a brity to come kick it with us smalltime and then just be like, ""Hey, chums.""",7,3
Roscoe,"""Let's get tight with Gryzz.""",7,3
Tom Haverford,We need a celebrity as a minority owner.,7,3
Tom Haverford,It will strengthen Gryzzl's bid.,7,3
Ron Swanson,Is a celebrity necessary?,7,3
Ron Swanson,I prefer quality over flash.,7,3
Ron Swanson,That's why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.,7,3
Donna Meagle,Celebrities can help with this kind of thing.,7,3
Donna Meagle,The Nets wouldn't be in Brooklyn if it weren't for Jay Z.,7,3
Donna Meagle,And the sales for ChickfilA went through the roof once Elton John bought them.,7,3
Roscoe,Exactly.,7,3
Roscoe,Gryzzl is an outsider here in Pawnee.,7,3
Roscoe,"So, a local celebrity is going to make everyone feel more at ease with us.",7,3
Roscoe,And that's why we called on you home court chillers to frack your brainiums.,7,3
Tom Haverford,"Since we're locals, they want us to think of ideas--",7,3
Ron Swanson,I got it from context.,7,3
Tom Haverford,Okay.,7,3
Ron Swanson,I have no interest in consorting with celebrities.,7,3
Ron Swanson,"The only celebrities I recognize are furniture maker Garry Knox Bennett, designer of the notorious and Magnus, the five-by-five bull elk I saw near my cabin two years ago.",7,3
Ron Swanson,"Took a shot at the bastard, and he stuck his antlers through the door of my meat shed.",7,3
Ron Swanson,"One day, Magnus, I will wear you as a jacket.",7,3

Andy Dwyer,You could be an airline pilot.,7,3
April Ludgate,I don't like heights.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,What about a submarine pilot?,7,3
April Ludgate,I don't like depths.,7,3
April Ludgate,"I don't like anything, okay?",7,3
April Ludgate,You're not gonna be able to find a career for me.,7,3

Ben Wyatt,Can we run over to Ron's office and take care of this?,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, I love it when you talk Point of Sale docs.",7,3
Leslie Knope,You know it turns me on.,7,3
Leslie Knope,But no.,7,3
Leslie Knope,No.,7,3
Leslie Knope,There's no way that I will be in the same room with Ron Swanson unless it is during a police lineup when I am pointing him out as the man who betrayed me.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"""That's him, officer!""",7,3
Leslie Knope,"""Ronald Swanson.""",7,3
Leslie Knope,"""Thank you, Leslie, that's the fifth crime you've solved this month.""",7,3
Leslie Knope,"""I'm not supposed to do this, but let me give you a badge and a siren for your car.""",7,3
Ben Wyatt,Could you please focus?,7,3
Ben Wyatt,It will take two minutes.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"And all signatures need to be notarized, and I really don't want to have to schedule two different notary appointments.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,"Not to eavesdrop, but I have a crazy story.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,"I recently had a bit of a health scare, just a couple weeks in the hospital.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,This story's terrible so far.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, I became really motivated once I got out to finally live life to the fullest.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,"So, I fulfilled one of my lifelong dreams, and I became a Notary Public.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,"So, if I go with you, Ron and Leslie can sign the document separately.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben?",7,3
Leslie Knope,It all works out.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"I'll sign the documents here, and then you can bring it to Ron and he can sign it there, and then you can tell Ron to rot in hell.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,How long are you two going to go on like this?,7,3
Ben Wyatt,You're acting like a little kid.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not.",7,3

Donna Meagle,Yeah.,7,3
Donna Meagle,That's your handwriting.,7,3
Tom Haverford,"These are all great options, but I think we need to go after Pawnee's biggest fish.",7,3
Tom Haverford,Annabel Porter from Bloosh.,7,3
Ron Swanson,That horrifying Lifestyle Newsletter filled with vegan recipes and pointless tchotchkes?,7,3
Ron Swanson,Forget it.,7,3
Ron Swanson,That woman is my nightmare.,7,3
Donna Meagle,"Um, she's a big deal, Ron.",7,3
Donna Meagle,Bloosh has won the Pulitzer Prize for best top ten listicle two years in a row.,7,3
Bill Haggerty,"Hi, Leslie.",7,3
Bill Haggerty,Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee Historical Society.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Bill, I remember you.",7,3
Bill Haggerty,"I heard you were looking for information on the Newport land, and I have some very exciting news for you.",7,3
Bill Haggerty,It concerns William Henry Harrison.,7,3
Leslie Knope,We claim William Henry Harrison as a hero because he was the first governor of the Indiana territories and then President of the United States.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"We're also a little ashamed of him because he didn't wear a coat at his inauguration, caught a bad cold and died 32 days later.",7,3
Leslie Knope,He's an embarrassing footnote.,7,3
Leslie Knope,But he's our embarrassing footnote.,7,3
Bill Haggerty,"I've recently self published a biography about Harrison entitled ""Barely a President. William Henry Harrison's Thirty Two Days in the White House.""",7,3
Bill Haggerty,I discovered that Harrison had a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land you're trying to acquire.,7,3
April Ludgate,"Um, spoilers much?",7,3
April Ludgate,Now I'll never read that book.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"If a US President had a house on that land, it could qualify for historic landmark status, and we could really stick it to Ron's team.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"Which would be icing on the cake, not the reason why we're doing this.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Show me this incredible lodge.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Let's go.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,"That book sounded so boring, I cried a little.",7,3
April Ludgate,"Oh, babe, I'm sorry you had to hear that.",7,3
April Ludgate,You're safe now.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry to bother you, but I need you to sign this Point of Sale document.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,And please sign it in cursive.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,It raises a lot of red flags if you don't.,7,3
Ron Swanson,No.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,7,3
Ron Swanson,"So, what's Leslie up to?",7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't think I should discuss that, given that you're in competition.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,Need to remain neutral.,7,3
Ron Swanson,Fair enough.,7,3
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what's Leslie up to?",7,3
Jerry Gergich,She is trying to find a historical reason to earmark the land for preservation.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on, man.",7,3
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you little sneak.",7,3
Ron Swanson,"If Leslie is going for a hook, we should, too.",7,3
Ron Swanson,Let's get Annabel Bloosh person.,7,3
Tom Haverford,Yes.,7,3
Tom Haverford,Glad to see you've finally come around after these two minutes of insanity.,7,3
Tom Haverford,"Now, will you please consider investing in that toddler cologne I've been bugging you about?",7,3
Tom Haverford,Toddler cologne.,7,3
Tom Haverford,"Baby, you smell good.",7,3
Bill Haggerty,Here we are.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Here we are, like, ""Here's the place where I buried the map that will show us the way to William Henry Harrison's awesome hunting cabin?""",7,3
Bill Haggerty,No.,7,3
Bill Haggerty,This is all that's left.,7,3
April Ludgate,This place is awesome.,7,3
April Ludgate,"Babe, we should sell our dumb house and buy this one.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love William Henry Harrison as much, if not slightly more than, the next guy, but this is garbage.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"I mean, literally.",7,3
Leslie Knope,There's a bag of old hamburgers over there.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,What?,7,3
Andy Dwyer,How old?,7,3
Leslie Knope,"We're running out of time, and we need to beat Ron.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to have to use this old pile of bricks.",7,3
Leslie Knope,I need to gather everything I can on William Henry Harrison.,7,3
Bill Haggerty,Let's head to the Harrison museum over in Vincennes.,7,3
Bill Haggerty,I volunteer there part time.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,I found an artifact!,7,3
Andy Dwyer,Historical artifact!,7,3
Andy Dwyer,William Henry Harrison's wig.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Andy.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Put that down.,7,3
April Ludgate,Cool.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,You've got to be kidding me.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,"No, I'm sorry, Ben, but there's a page missing from the document.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,"So, then, the signatures are invalid.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,Can't we just say it was there?,7,3
Jerry Gergich,You're asking a notary to lie.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,"I signed an oath, Ben.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,And then a different notary notarized the oath I signed.,7,3
April Ludgate,William Henry Harrison is totally ridiculous.,7,3
April Ludgate,They can't even fill a small museum with real stuff about his life because he was so lame.,7,3
April Ludgate,The If He'd Worn A Coat room explores how great America would have been if Harrison had worn a coat at his inauguration and not died.,7,3
April Ludgate,This room is called Other Things That Were Famous For One Month.,7,3
April Ludgate,"Oh, and side note, admission to this museum costs 14 dollars.",7,3
April Ludgate,"And while you're here, why not visit the Other Famous Harrisons exhibit?",7,3
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, this is so great.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"During the election campaign of 1840, William Henry Harrison supporters rolled this ten foot tin and paper ball down country lanes all across America.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"And they would sing along with a jug band, and it was just so exciting.",7,3
Leslie Knope,People would come from miles just to see it.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,Why?,7,3
Andy Dwyer,Was there something inside the stupid ball?,7,3
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!,7,3
Andy Dwyer,Like a giant hamster?,7,3
Leslie Knope,"This is what we have to work with, okay?",7,3
Leslie Knope,"We are up against a very flashy Internet company, and we should be aiming for quantity over quality.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to throw a bunch of Harrison facts at them and a big pile of bricks and whatever else we can find.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people!",7,3
Leslie Knope,Quantity!,7,3
Tom Haverford,Wow!,7,3
Tom Haverford,This is exactly what I imagined heaven looks like.,7,3
Tom Haverford,Right down to the unisex linen tunics.,7,3
Tom Haverford,"Annabel, ma cherie.",7,3
Annabel Porter,Hi.,7,3
Annabel Porter,I'm sorry I'm late for our coven.,7,3
Annabel Porter,I was polishing my oyster forks with a cage-free olive oil rub.,7,3
Ron Swanson,"Apology accepted, and then I have no reaction to anything else you said.",7,3
Donna Meagle,"I can't help but ask, what's in right now?",7,3
Annabel Porter,"Well, this season, I'm intrigued by asymmetrical overalls, angora toothbrushes, and locally sourced Italian flip-flops.",7,3
Annabel Porter,"Also, there's a flirty trend in beverages.",7,3
Annabel Porter,"So, you've had soy milk and almond milk.",7,3
Annabel Porter,"Now, try the hottest new craze, beef milk.",7,3
Annabel Porter,It's like almond milk that's been squeezed through tiny holes in living cows.,7,3
Ron Swanson,That's [bleep] milk.,7,3
Tom Haverford,No.,7,3
Annabel Porter,No.,7,3
Tom Haverford,Milk costs 3 dollars a gallon.,7,3
Tom Haverford,"Annabel's authentic, hand-strained teat-to-table Beef Milk?",7,3
Tom Haverford,That costs 60 dollars a gallon.,7,3
Donna Meagle,Yeah.,7,3
Donna Meagle,And there's a wait list.,7,3
Donna Meagle,This woman knows business.,7,3
Annabel Porter,And I would be extremely jazzed to be part of the Gryzzl bid.,7,3
Annabel Porter,Shall we discuss it in my yurt?,7,3
Annabel Porter,Great.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,Ron.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's try this again.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,All pages accounted for.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,Just sign right here.,7,3
Ron Swanson,How is Leslie doing with her quest?,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Again, I don't want to talk about her plan with you, nor yours with her.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure you understand.,7,3
Ron Swanson,Absolutely.,7,3
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what is Leslie up to?",7,3
Jerry Gergich,Getting ready for a big press conference.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on!",7,3
Ron Swanson,A press conference?,7,3
Ron Swanson,"So, she's found something to strengthen her bid.",7,3
Ron Swanson,Ms. Porter.,7,3
Annabel Porter,Mmm?,7,3
Ron Swanson,No need to discuss any further.,7,3
Ron Swanson,You will be the face of the Gryzzl bid.,7,3
Annabel Porter,Smashing.,7,3
Annabel Porter,"Well, this calls for a celebratory dram of aged grappa.",7,3
Annabel Porter,"So, I just sign here?",7,3
Ben Wyatt,No!,7,3
Ben Wyatt,No!,7,3
Ben Wyatt,No!,7,3
Ben Wyatt,Ah!,7,3
Annabel Porter,Great.,7,3
Annabel Porter,There you go.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, that's invalid now.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,I know.,7,3
April Ludgate,"Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty.",7,3
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I really like your museum.,7,3
April Ludgate,It's weird and sad and unnecessary.,7,3
April Ludgate,"Is there, like, a museum curator position I could apply for?",7,3
Bill Haggerty,"Sorry, everyone here is a volunteer.",7,3
Bill Haggerty,"Though you do get a yearly stipend of 50,000 Harrison Bucks.",7,3
Bill Haggerty,Accepted only at that vending machine.,7,3
April Ludgate,Thanks.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,That's a bummer.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,"But, hey, babe, listen.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you could start your own museum.,7,3
April Ludgate,About what?,7,3
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, but I am not like you.",7,3
April Ludgate,You love everything.,7,3
April Ludgate,"The only things I like are dogs, sleeping late, and weird birthmarks.",7,3
April Ludgate,You can't make museums about those.,7,3
April Ludgate,This is another dead end.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Guys, let's keep it going.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Right?,7,3
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab the reading glasses.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab that walking stick.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Grab everything you can.,7,3
Leslie Knope,I'm officially dubbing this Operation Quantity.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God you're still here.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,I cannot believe the weird notary hell I've been trapped in.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,It's been more like heaven for me.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, what a day.",7,3
Leslie Knope,What's Ron up to?,7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I am not--",7,3
Leslie Knope,"No, you have to tell me because you legally bound yourself to me in marriage, sucker.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,They got Annabel Porter to be the celebrity face of their group.,7,3
Leslie Knope,That little rat.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Two can play this game.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Bill, Operation Quantity needs a face.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Does William Henry Harrison have any direct descendants in the area?,7,3
Bill Haggerty,One.,7,3
Bill Haggerty,A distant nephew named Zach Harrison.,7,3
Leslie Knope,This is our guy!,7,3
Leslie Knope,American royalty!,7,3
Leslie Knope,His veins pulse with the blood of our storied forefathers!,7,3
Andy Dwyer,Zach Harrison?,7,3
Andy Dwyer,I went to camp with this guy.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,No one would ride in the boat with him because he had terrible BO.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,"Then, he went with Janine, our counselor, and he fell asleep and got a boner.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's American royalty.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Okay?,7,3
Leslie Knope,And we need him for the press conference.,7,3
Leslie Knope,And we need all of this stuff.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"So help me God, I will make a mountain out of this molehill.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I do--",7,3
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,Notary publics can trace our origin all the way back to ancient Rome.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,No way.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,Calvin Coolidge was a notary.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,Mmmhmm.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad and so was Calvin Coolidge's paternal grandfather.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,Uh-huh.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,It's 2.5 pounds of pressure is what you need to get the perfect stamp.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,"This monthly-- Well, it's a notary email newsletter.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,"And, oh, my gosh.",7,3
Ben Wyatt,Right.,7,3
Jerry Gergich,"Ben, it's fun.",7,3
Jerry Gergich,It's just fun.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I have been thinking a lot about what you said.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,I made a list of everything that I know you like.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,"Playing with our dog, staring contests, sex with me, etc.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,"And then, I lost the list.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,"So, I had to make a new list.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,"I didn't have any paper, so I wrote it on my leg.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,And that's when my leg fell asleep.,7,3
April Ludgate,"Okay, could you just skip ahead a little?",7,3
Andy Dwyer,What do all the things on that list have in common?,7,3
Andy Dwyer,They're one-on-one.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,You like dealing with people or dogs one-on-one.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,"See, we don't make a list of the things that you love.",7,3
Andy Dwyer,We make a list of the reasons why you love them.,7,3
Andy Dwyer,And then we find something that fits that list.,7,3
April Ludgate,You're the best husband ever.,7,3
Zach Harrison,"Hi, Zach Harrison.",7,3
Zach Harrison,You wanted to meet with me about a press conference?,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello, Zach.",7,3
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am Leslie.",7,3
Leslie Knope,It is an honor to have you here.,7,3
Leslie Knope,You are Indiana's last living link to this great man.,7,3
Zach Harrison,"Look, I really don't think you should make a big deal out of this.",7,3
Zach Harrison,I just happen to be a descendant of a guy.,7,3
Zach Harrison,"You could be the descendant of George Washington, I wouldn't know.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Do you?,7,3
Zach Harrison,"No, that was just a hypothetical--",7,3
Leslie Knope,Could that be possible?,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Because, you know, I've always thought that we shared very similar jawlines.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Wow.,7,3
Leslie Knope,That's something to chew on.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, okay, doesn't matter.",7,3
Leslie Knope,I need this to be very impressive.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"So, head on in there and be presidentially descended.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Just go in there.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Okay?,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Just walk, walk, walk there.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Quiet now.,7,3

Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no.",7,3
Leslie Knope,What?,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing here?",7,3
Ron Swanson,"Setting up for our press conference, which will take place immediately after yours.",7,3
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?,7,3
Leslie Knope,You can't do that.,7,3
April Ludgate,Do you want me to bite him?,7,3
Leslie Knope,No.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Ignore them.,7,3
Leslie Knope,We start in 10 minutes.,7,3
Donna Meagle,"Swanson, you didn't say anything about ambushing Leslie's press conference.",7,3
Ron Swanson,I didn't think it was relevant.,7,3
Tom Haverford,"Come on, man.",7,3
Tom Haverford,This isn't cool.,7,3
Ron Swanson,This is a competition.,7,3
Ron Swanson,We need to win it.,7,3
Ron Swanson,Please do your jobs.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Good evening.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is a place of culture, history, and heritage.",7,3
Leslie Knope,And the National Parks Service is proud to say that we've discovered a new chapter in the life of local hero and President William Henry Harrison.,7,3
Leslie Knope,A heretofore unknown hunting lodge was recently discovered smack dab in the middle of the Newport land.,7,3
Leslie Knope,What great historical moments took place within these hallowed halls?,7,3
Leslie Knope,Did Harrison plan his presidential campaign while sitting around the hearth which used to be there.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"Did he write letters to Thomas Jefferson on his rolltop desk, which, you know, I don't know, might have existed.",7,3
Leslie Knope,The point is William Henry Harrison would have wanted this land preserved as a national park.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Don't believe me?,7,3
Leslie Knope,Let's ask him.,7,3
Leslie Knope,"In the form of his direct descendant, Zachary.",7,3
Zach Harrison,"Hi, I'm Zach.",7,3
Zach Harrison,Harrison.,7,3
Leslie Knope,Amazing.,7,3
Zach Harrison,"Zachary, what is it like being a descendant of William Henry Harrison?",7,3
Zach Harrison,Uh... Harrison's a pretty common last name.,7,3

Ben Wyatt,Not that it matters.,7,3
Ben Wyatt,I'm definitely going to wake up tomorrow morning with the same forms for you to sign.,7,3

Leslie Knope,"We'll just wait a few minutes, turn on this monitor, and then we'll tell Ben that we talked it out and made up.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"I'll just tell them that I apologized for, whatever, heroically caring too much.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"And you admitted that you were a stubborn butthead, and everything's fine now.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Why do I have to be stubborn?,7,4
Ron Swanson,Why can't the problem have been that I was reasonable and you were at fault?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Because we want them to believe us and not laugh really hard at a ridiculous science fiction scenario.,7,4
Ron Swanson,We are not saying I was the problem.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"If we're going to lie to them, I will not let you lie to them.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'll tell them that, for the past three years, you've been a perfect gentleman and scholar, and I am an insane weirdo who, despite being the only reason we even had a friendship to begin with, decided to ruin it, out of the blue, for no good reason.",7,4

Leslie Knope,A well organized chart.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Three years ago, I accept a job at National Parks.",7,4

Leslie Knope,"And then, two months after that, Morningstar, the final twist of the knife.",7,4

Leslie Knope,"I hear about Morningstar, and I calmly saunter down to your office and attempt to have a rational discussion with you about it.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"What the hell, Ron?",7,4
Leslie Knope,You're building your stupid building on the block next to Pawnee Commons?,7,4
Leslie Knope,The park that I built from scratch out of a pit?,7,4

Leslie Knope,"Enjoy your new job, Judas.",7,4
Leslie Knope,You tear down Ann's house.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"You spend the next two years cutting down trees and fighting zoning laws that I helped pass, basically spitting on everything we did together at Parks.",7,4
Ron Swanson,That's not the whole story.,7,4
Leslie Knope,What does that mean?,7,4
Ron Swanson,It means what it means.,7,4
Ron Swanson,That is not the whole story of why I left.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, your time is up.",7,4
Leslie Knope,Wait.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Why then?,7,4
Leslie Knope,What was the reason?,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on.",7,4

Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on!",7,4
Ron Swanson,See you tomorrow morning.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Progress.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Is it that I sent you a birthday card through the US mail so the post office knew your address?,7,4
Ron Swanson,No.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Go away.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Oh, is it because I had Food and Stuff temporarily shut down due to a health code violation?",7,4
Ron Swanson,That was you?,7,4
Leslie Knope,They had fresh produce out right next to the roach spray.,7,4

Ron Swanson,"If you don't like it, go to that new place, Complete Food.",7,4
Leslie Knope,It's called Whole Foods.,7,4
Leslie Knope,And is that really the reason?,7,4
Ron Swanson,No.,7,4
Ron Swanson,How many more questions are you going to ask me?,7,4
Leslie Knope,As many as I need to to solve this mystery and get us engaged in a deep and stimulating conversation about our friendship.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing?",7,4
Ron Swanson,I know I saw it.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Ah-hah!,7,4
Ron Swanson,Detonator.,7,4

Ron Swanson,I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door so I can get out of here.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just wait a second.",7,4
Ron Swanson,No.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"I'm being held as a prisoner against my will, and I have the right, as a citizen of the United States, to blow a hole in that [bleep] door and walk out as a free man.",7,4
Ron Swanson,It's in the Constitution.,7,4
Leslie Knope,There's no cursing in the Constitution.,7,4

Ron Swanson,Too late.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Here we go.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Fire in the hole!,7,4

Leslie Knope,I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.,7,4
Ron Swanson,You told me this was a genuine partially defused Claymore mine.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such.",7,4
Ron Swanson,You mean to tell me I have had a toy on my desk for 10 years?,7,4
Leslie Knope,You mean to tell me you've thought you had an actual land mine on your desk?,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron.",7,4
Leslie Knope,You've been doing an explosive job!,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron.",7,4
Leslie Knope,It's funny stuff.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Who gets angry at balloons?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Good talk.,7,4
Ron Swanson,What's all this?,7,4
Leslie Knope,"I'm just reading back through some of our old projects, trying to figure out what happened that made you quit.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"Good God, woman.",7,4
Leslie Knope,This is a code.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I am going to break it.,7,4
Leslie Knope,And this is my best shot.,7,4

Leslie Knope,No.,7,4
Leslie Knope,This is my job application from when you hired me.,7,4
Ron Swanson,How did you get that?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Freedom of Information Act request.,7,4
Leslie Knope,But here's the thing.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I've never read it.,7,4
Leslie Knope,This application contains your very first impressions of me.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron.",7,4
Leslie Knope,The beginning of the whole shebang.,7,4
Leslie Knope,This is all you wrote?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Three lousy lines?,7,4
Ron Swanson,Why would anyone need more than three lines?,7,4
Ron Swanson,"I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique.",7,4
Ron Swanson,I forgot what I wrote.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Can I hear it?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Why don't you read it yourself?,7,4
Ron Swanson,"""Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky.""",7,4
Ron Swanson,"So far, so accurate.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"""If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other.""",7,4
Leslie Knope,You forgot the last sentence.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"No, I didn't.",7,4
Ron Swanson,I remember that part.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"It says, ""Hire her.""",7,4
Ron Swanson,Did you hear that?,7,4
Leslie Knope,It's a person.,7,4
Leslie Knope,It's another person!,7,4
Ron Swanson,Hello!,7,4
Ron Swanson,Hello!,7,4
Ron Swanson,Janitor!,7,4
Leslie Knope,Hey!,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we're trapped in here!",7,4

Ron Swanson,"If you just look over here for two seconds, I'll do anything.",7,4
Leslie Knope,Hey!,7,4
Ron Swanson,I'll watch a foreign film.,7,4
Ron Swanson,I'll talk to a man with a ponytail.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Oh!,7,4
Leslie Knope,"He's gone, Ron.",7,4
Leslie Knope,He's gone.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Why did you give me the job?,7,4
Leslie Knope,And that's what I don't get.,7,4
Leslie Knope,We should've never worked together.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Why did you hire me?,7,4
Ron Swanson,Because of your interview.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that doesn't make any sense.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I remember that interview.",7,4
Leslie Knope,You were wearing that exact outfit.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"And you said to me, ""Ms. Knope, I have one question for you.""",7,4
Leslie Knope,"""What do you believe the role of government is in America?""",7,4
Ron Swanson,You blathered on for 10 minutes about social safety nets and honest governance and improving lives.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Basic nonsense.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Then you said, ""Everything that just came out of your mouth is basic nonsense.""",7,4
Leslie Knope,"""Good day.""",7,4
Leslie Knope,And that was it.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"No, that was not it.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"After I said you were full of it, you got very angry and scrunched up your face and said, ""Excuse me, sir, but I disagree.""",7,4
Ron Swanson,Did you let me have it.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"That was one of your top 10 tirades, I'd say.",7,4
Ron Swanson,You were pounding your fist and shaking.,7,4
Ron Swanson,You called me a heartless thug.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I most certainly did not.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"You were tough and honest, and you stood up for what you believed in, even though it might've killed your chance to get the job.",7,4
Ron Swanson,I would rather work with a person like that than with a milquetoast yes-man.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Should be one more thing in that file.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the thank you note I wrote to you after the interview.",7,4
Leslie Knope,You kept it.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Mr. Swanson, I'm sorry for raising my voice in the interview, and I'm sorry I called you a heartless thug.""",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, okay.",7,4
Leslie Knope,There you go.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"""If it matters, I promise I would never ""raise my voice at you if we worked together.""",7,4
Ron Swanson,Liar.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I was being really optimistic.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"""Please enjoy these homemade brownies as a gesture of goodwill.""",7,4
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope.""",7,4
Ron Swanson,That was the real reason I hired you.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Those brownies were damn good.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron, look how far we've come.",7,4
Leslie Knope,We're doing so great.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Let's just bring it home, okay?",7,4
Leslie Knope,Let's just talk about our issues.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, don't push it.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"If I guess and guess right, you have to tell me.",7,4
Leslie Knope,Ready?,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Two years ago, you found out you were a quarter French and you had a nervous breakdown.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"Okay, playtime is over.",7,4
Ron Swanson,I'm getting out of here once and for all.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron!",7,4
Leslie Knope,"God, no!",7,4
Leslie Knope,That alarm is just for sprinklers.,7,4
Leslie Knope,April kept pulling it.,7,4
Leslie Knope,So the fire department disconnected it.,7,4
Ron Swanson,I see.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Ron?,7,4
Leslie Knope,I found some towels.,7,4
Leslie Knope,You okay?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Wow.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Craig is studying yoga.",7,4
Ron Swanson,These are the only dry clothes I could find.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look great.",7,4
Ron Swanson,I feel extremely angry.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on.",7,4

Leslie Knope,I've seen you with your eyebrows blown off.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I've seen you without a mustache.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I've seen it all.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"There's nowhere to run, Ron.",7,4
Leslie Knope,You have tried every possible means of escape.,7,4
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to do but talk.,7,4
Leslie Knope,What happened to these workplace proximity associates?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Hmm?,7,4
Leslie Knope,Spill it.,7,4
Ron Swanson,You left.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Then a month later, you took Terry with you.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum, and he's the best there is.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Amen.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Then you took April.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"I didn't want her to go, as she had become one of my closest workplace acquaintances.",7,4
Ron Swanson,But your offer was too good to pass up.,7,4
Ron Swanson,So I didn't try to stop her.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Then Tom left to run his business.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Donna left to run hers.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"One day, I looked up.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Just didn't recognize anyone.,7,4
Ron Swanson,So I made a decision.,7,4
Ron Swanson,An unthinkable decision.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Hey.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Well, my, my, my.",7,4
Leslie Knope,Do my eyes deceive me? Is that Ron Swanson?,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"Hello, April.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Larry.,7,4
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, It's Terry now.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Okay.,7,4
Ron Swanson,As luck would have it--,7,4
Leslie Knope,One second.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the Northeast that we need to put pressure on them, or else we're gonna be waiting forever, and I'm tired of waiting on them, okay? Okay.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, this is a crazy day.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"So what's up with you, you big lug?",7,4
Ron Swanson,Nothing important.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Just thought you might want to have lunch.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Tomorrow?,7,4
Leslie Knope,I would love to.,7,4
Leslie Knope,It's been too long.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"JJ's Diner, 12:30?",7,4
Ron Swanson,Excellent.,7,4

April Ludgate,Okay.,7,4
April Ludgate,"So Randy says the House is voting tomorrow, and they need us in Washington to prep.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?",7,4
April Ludgate,Yeah.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Okay, get us the first flight out of here and grab the Missouri files.",7,4
Leslie Knope,Meet me at my car.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Hey, babe.",7,4
Leslie Knope,I got to go to Washington.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Can you pick up the kids?,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Oh... Oh, no.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I stood you up for lunch.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"You did, yes.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"I waited for a while, but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Your life seemed pretty hectic.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Is that the rest of the story? That I stood you up?,7,4
Leslie Knope,You were going to ask me something.,7,4
Leslie Knope,That's why you wanted to have lunch.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you were going--",7,4
Ron Swanson,I was gonna ask you for a job.,7,4
Ron Swanson,In the federal government.,7,4
Ron Swanson,Just saying it out loud feels dirty.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"You missed your friends, and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again.",7,4
Leslie Knope,I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"God, why didn't I see that?",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I am so sorry.",7,4
Leslie Knope,I should've been a better friend to you.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Honestly, Leslie, it's fine.",7,4
Ron Swanson,It was a punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written.,7,4
Ron Swanson,My time in government work was over.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Sure, I loved shutting things down and bleeding the rotting beast from the inside.",7,4
Leslie Knope,Your metaphors are so beautiful.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"But it was time for me to leave, and I didn't feel like explaining why to you or anyone.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"Everything that happened after, the fight we had, not giving you a heads-up when my company took on the Morningstar development and bulldozed the nurse's old house, I do regret that.",7,4
Ron Swanson,I had a good run here.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"But after you and Tom and Donna and April and Terry left, when I looked around this office, nothing was the same.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that.",7,4
Leslie Knope,England's got a new queen Everybody's really mean We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning,7,4
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is different from what I expected to find.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Morning, guys.",7,4
Andy Dwyer,"Good morning, Leslie.",7,4
Craig Middlebrooks,"What did you do to the office? Ron, you're wearing my yoga clothes.",7,4
Craig Middlebrooks,You're gonna stretch out the elastic.,7,4
Leslie Knope,We're sorry.,7,4
Leslie Knope,Fire and money and people,7,4
April Ludgate,Hey.,7,4
April Ludgate,I moved our meetings to tomorrow because you are drunk and hungover simultaneously at 2:00 in the afternoon.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call.",7,4
April Ludgate,"Also, you have a visitor.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"No, whoever it is, I have zero interest in--",7,4
Ron Swanson,Hello.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron.",7,4
Ron Swanson,"We just spent 12 hours together, woman.",7,4
Leslie Knope,Don't care.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I have three years' worth of hugs to force upon you against your will.,7,4
Ron Swanson,I have a small object for you.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"Call it an official peace offering, I suppose.",7,4
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is very sweet.",7,4
Leslie Knope,But you do realize I gave you this picture six hours ago.,7,4
Ron Swanson,The frame is the gift.,7,4
Ron Swanson,"When my company took on the Morningstar development, and I realized it meant bulldozing Ann's old house, I salvaged her front door.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Then I stripped off all the terrible paint and lacquer-- People really don't know how to finish wood properly.,7,4
Ron Swanson,And I made it into this frame for you in the event that you and I everâ¦,7,4
Leslie Knope,Ron.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"You big, fat, giant sap.",7,4
Ron Swanson,That seems unnecessary.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I love it.,7,4
Leslie Knope,But I feel bad.,7,4
Leslie Knope,I don't have anything for you.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"For the first time in my life, I am present-less.",7,4
Ron Swanson,How about you buy me a meal? You hungry?,7,4
Leslie Knope,I'm starving.,7,4
Leslie Knope,"April, Ron and I are going to JJ's to eat too much breakfast food.",7,4
Ron Swanson,Why does anybody in the world ever eat anything but breakfast food?,7,4
Leslie Knope,"People are idiots, Ron.",7,4

Leslie Knope,Forget it.,7,5
Leslie Knope,It's impossible.,7,5
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna work in a million years.,7,5
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.,7,5
Leslie Knope,I give up.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,"Good attitude, honey.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, what do you want from me?",7,5
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to get a group of people to give me their land rather than sell it to Gryzzl for 90 million dollars.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my basic argument is, ""Please give us the land.""",7,5
Leslie Knope,"""It would be so nice.""",7,5
Leslie Knope,Gryzzl has billions of dollars.,7,5
Leslie Knope,There's no way I beat them.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Hey.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,I've seen you beat tougher odds than this.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,They're just a company.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,They're not that powerful.,7,5
Leslie Knope,Whoa!,7,5
Leslie Knope,"""Open your door?""",7,5
Leslie Knope,Ah!,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!",7,5
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're about to die!",7,5
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.,7,5

Mike Bean,"Please enjoy this free gift, courtesy of Gryzzl.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, they also have a squadron of flying robots giving presents to everyone.",7,5
Mike Bean,Later!,7,5
Leslie Knope,We're screwed.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,Mmmâ¦,7,5
Tom Haverford,"New dish we're working on, tell me what you think.",7,5
Tom Haverford,"It's a red and white heirloom red bean pasta, with an imported Tuscan walnut herb sauce infused with shaved heritage Pecorino Romano.",7,5
Tom Haverford,"What, you're done?",7,5
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,Really good.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,Why are you doing new dishes?,7,5
Tom Haverford,"Lucy is visiting her boyfriend, Conrad, in Chicago.",7,5
Tom Haverford,So I'm just trying to distract myself with work so I don't think about the marathon bone sex they're probably having.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know what, dude, you gotta take your mind off them.",7,5
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,It's a contract.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,"It came from the station manager where I do my show, Johnny Karate.",7,5
Andy Dwyer,"He wants me to sign it, but it says that they'll own the character Johnny Karate.",7,5
Andy Dwyer,"And I want to own the character Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me.",7,5
Tom Haverford,"Wait, this says they only pay you 100 bucks a week?",7,5
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but all I really do is goof around all day, write, produce and direct a TV show.",7,5
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, I act in it, I do sets, props, wardrobe.",7,5
Andy Dwyer,At the end I drive everybody home.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,"So, I mean, 100 bucks a week, that's pretty fair.",7,5
Tom Haverford,This is perfect.,7,5
Tom Haverford,I'll be your agent.,7,5
Tom Haverford,I'll put all my energy into renegotiating your contract.,7,5
Tom Haverford,I won't even think about Lucy and Conrad and his stupid crunches that he probably does.,7,5
Tom Haverford,I should probably do some crunches.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Let's go.,7,5
Tom Haverford,"Andy, my tumtum!",7,5
Donna Meagle,"Knope, I need to talk to you.",7,5
Leslie Knope,What's up?,7,5
Donna Meagle,"I know I technically work for Gryzzl, but these fools have crossed a line.",7,5
Donna Meagle,Have you gotten one of these Gryzzl boxes?,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, but I haven't opened it yet.",7,5
Leslie Knope,Planning on sending it back after I wrote a sternly worded letter about how I cannot be bought with free gifts.,7,5
Donna Meagle,These are my free gifts.,7,5
Donna Meagle,Two honey bears and a canister of sugar plums.,7,5
Donna Meagle,Honeybear and Sugar Plum are the special names Joe and I call each other.,7,5
Leslie Knope,Aww!,7,5
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, we're adorable, but this is creepy.",7,5
Donna Meagle,Because we only call each other these things on the phone or in texts.,7,5
Donna Meagle,How do they even know?,7,5
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, open that box they sent you.",7,5
Leslie Knope,Ooh!,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Joe Biden's book, Biden the Rails, 1,001 Poems Inspired by My Travels through Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,A thousand?,7,5
Leslie Knope,A poster of the Supreme Court Justices sipping the Friends milkshake!,7,5
Leslie Knope,This stuff is perfect for me.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, exactly.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,They must be datamining.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Searching our texts and emails and gathering profiles on all of us.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,"This is a huge invasion of privacy, not to mention illegal.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,"When they installed their free WiFi in town, I made sure that there was language preventing this.",7,5
Donna Meagle,I never would have agreed to work with them if I had known they were gonna be snoopin' in my biz.,7,5
Donna Meagle,Gryzzl is going down.,7,5
Donna Meagle,"You wanna put me on blast, I'm gonna put you on front street.",7,5
Leslie Knope,I don't understand what that means but I think I get the context and I love it!,7,5
Craig Middlebrooks,"April, the new Parks interns start today, and I was wondering if you would deliver a little welcome speech.",7,5
April Ludgate,No.,7,5
April Ludgate,Go away.,7,5
Craig Middlebrooks,"Watermelon martinis, exposed brick, Keri Russell's hair.",7,5
April Ludgate,Why did you just say those weird things?,7,5
Craig Middlebrooks,"On the advice of my therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, whenever I feel like yelling, I just take a deep breath and say three great things about being alive.",7,5
April Ludgate,Gross.,7,5
Craig Middlebrooks,Please talk to my interns.,7,5
April Ludgate,Fine.,7,5
April Ludgate,Whatever.,7,5
April Ludgate,I'll do it.,7,5
April Ludgate,"I started here when I was 20, and now I'm old and gross and directionless.",7,5
April Ludgate,"Those kids are me 10 years ago, and this internship is the videotape from The Ring.",7,5
April Ludgate,"It's too late for me, I've seen too much, but maybe I can save them.",7,5
April Ludgate,You're all gonna die in here!,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone.",7,5
Leslie Knope,We are here today to discuss Gryzzl and whether or not they are invading our privacy.,7,5
Extra,They sent my husband three boxes of genital cream to his office.,7,5
Extra,"My husband's splotchy genitals are no one's business except for his, mine, and his many genital doctors.",7,5
Pearl,They sent me a bunch of toy pigs dressed like movie stars.,7,5
Pearl,That's my private hobby.,7,5
Pearl,No one knows I collect toy pigs dressed like movie stars.,7,5
Pearl,Except now all of you people.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Which one is that?,7,5
Pearl,This is actually Hamuel L. Jackson from the movie Pork Fiction.,7,5
Pearl,"It's extremely rare, and I am keeping it.",7,5
Pearl,"But still, they have no right to give me something I will treasure the rest of my life.",7,5
Extra,I opened my box in front of all my friends and it was a bunch of Virginia Woolf novels.,7,5
Extra,Now Miley and Haley know I like to read!,7,5
Extra,What if they tell Evan?,7,5
Chance Frenlm,"I like their phones, but they've gone too far, sending this stuff to our houses.",7,5
Chance Frenlm,Gryzzl has no right to search our private data.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"So, wait.",7,5
Leslie Knope,You guys are not against us on this?,7,5
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this.,7,5
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!,7,5
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Finally, after months of searching for a way to defeat Gryzzl, we have found its Achilles' heel.",7,5
Leslie Knope,The town is behind us.,7,5
Leslie Knope,Donna is on our side.,7,5
Leslie Knope,And the next domino to fall?,7,5
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is Tom Selloink, but, you know, close enough.",7,5
Pearl,"Actually, I'm gonna need that back.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, of course.",7,5
Leslie Knope,February 2016.,7,5
Leslie Knope,I think you're gonna really enjoy this month's photo album.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"It includes such hits as first trip to the dentist, Sonia tries pizza, and water park vomit chain reaction.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,Why would you take pictures of that?,7,5
Leslie Knope,Why would you not?,7,5
Ron Swanson,"As you requested, here is a picture of my son, at a recent moment in his life.",7,5
Leslie Knope,So cute-- What are you doing?,7,5
Ron Swanson,Protecting my son's privacy.,7,5
Ron Swanson,"What, I'm just gonna carry around pictures of my child, where anyone could see them?",7,5
Donna Meagle,"Well, it's funny you should mention privacy, because that's our next topic.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"Ron technically works for Gryzzl, and when he finds out what Gryzzl is doing, he is going to lose his mind.",7,5
Ron Swanson,I have no reaction to this.,7,5
Leslie Knope,What?,7,5
Ron Swanson,"I do not pass judgment on the workings of private businesses, I just build their buildings.",7,5
Ron Swanson,"And frankly, if people are foolish enough to carry around a doodad that lets Gryzzl track their every move, this is what they get.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,But it's illegal.,7,5
Ron Swanson,I don't believe that's true.,7,5
Ron Swanson,"I've spent a fair amount of time with Gryzzl's highpriced lawyers, and they do seem to, as they say, ""Keep it 100.""",7,5
Donna Meagle,"Well, those fools still think I work for them.",7,5
Donna Meagle,"So, I can get you a private VIP tour of the building, maybe you can snoop around.",7,5
Roscoe,"Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe.",7,5
Roscoe,Psyched to give you guys a tour.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"I'm Darlene Johannsen, and this is my assistant turned lover, Gregory Strong.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"Ours is a new romance, but one that sent shockwaves through my architecture firm.",7,5
Leslie Knope,But it feels so right.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Steady.,7,5
Leslie Knope,We love Gryzzl and we would love to see how it all works.,7,5
Roscoe,Sweet.,7,5
Roscoe,Let's get loco.,7,5
April Ludgate,"Okay, so, let's get to know each other.",7,5
April Ludgate,"Talk about why you're here, whether you're throwing your lives away, stuff like that.",7,5
April Ludgate,"You, what brought you here?",7,5
Extra,I love the Parks Department.,7,5
Extra,I grew up near Ramsett Park and I used to go to tons of stuff there.,7,5
April Ludgate,Okay.,7,5
April Ludgate,That doesn't help me.,7,5
April Ludgate,Mork?,7,5

April Ludgate,Really?,7,5
Jen,No.,7,5
Jen,I just needed a college credit.,7,5
April Ludgate,What are you studying?,7,5

April Ludgate,I think that's cool.,7,5
Extra,"And, action.",7,5
Andy Dwyer,"We meet again, Puppy Hating Dan.",7,5
Andy Dwyer,You stole my guitar.,7,5
Andy Dwyer,And you put farts in my lunch!,7,5
Andy Dwyer,You've really done it this time.,7,5

Tom Haverford,"Great job, bud.",7,5
Tom Haverford,You crushed it.,7,5
Tom Haverford,I love being Andy's agent.,7,5
Tom Haverford,"He does all the work, and I get 10% just for showing up.",7,5
Tom Haverford,"It's like a chef at a restaurant making all the food and then the owner gets the profit, which is my other job.",7,5
Tom Haverford,"Man, I really got things figured out.",7,5
Hank Muntak,Let's make this quick.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Andy's show gets huge ratings in three cities.,7,5
Tom Haverford,His GryzzlTube page has millions of views.,7,5
Tom Haverford,"If you don't want Andy walking over to your rival station in Snerling, I think you should start taking this seriously.",7,5
Hank Muntak,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do.",7,5
Hank Muntak,I'm gonna upgrade the parking spot.,7,5
Hank Muntak,"But my son gets a role as one of the kid ninjas, all right?",7,5
Hank Muntak,He's gonna love me for it.,7,5
Hank Muntak,It's gonna drive my exwife crazy.,7,5
Tom Haverford,"So far, so good.",7,5
Tom Haverford,"But, in the words of Jerry Maguire",7,5
Andy Dwyer,The human head weighs 8 pounds.,7,5
Tom Haverford,No.,7,5
Tom Haverford,"""Show me the money.""",7,5

Hank Muntak,I'm a kingmaker.,7,5
Hank Muntak,"Pip Wiley, Chuck Warschank, Selena Gomez.",7,5
Hank Muntak,I made them.,7,5
Tom Haverford,You discovered Selena Gomez?,7,5
Hank Muntak,Different Selena Gomez.,7,5
Hank Muntak,"Look, I don't have the money for a raise.",7,5
Tom Haverford,"Uh Yeah, you do.",7,5
Tom Haverford,I've seen profit reports.,7,5
Tom Haverford,The show is a bonanza.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Andy starts making $500 a week.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Now.,7,5
Hank Muntak,Get the hell out of my office.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Sit down.,7,5

April Ludgate,What do you love doing?,7,5
Jen,Texting.,7,5
April Ludgate,What did you wanna be when you were little?,7,5
Jen,A scary mermaid that lures sailors to their death.,7,5
April Ludgate,"Okay, side note, I'm gonna file papers to adopt you as my child, so keep an eye out for that.",7,5
April Ludgate,"But more importantly, don't do this internship.",7,5
April Ludgate,"Go do something fun, like trying to control birds with your mind, or posting Internet comments as Michael Jackson's ghost.",7,5
Jen,Okay.,7,5
Jen,Maybe you're right.,7,5
Jen,Thanks.,7,5
Extra,"Hey, April!",7,5

April Ludgate,"Thanks, Mike.",7,5
Roscoe,I'm sorry this building is so lame.,7,5
Roscoe,"As soon as we get our new headquarters built, it's gonna be way, way tighter.",7,5
Roscoe,Check it.,7,5
Roscoe,Matty.,7,5
Roscoe,"Okay, this is GryzzlVibe.",7,5
Roscoe,It's this new app that we're developing that monitors your mood.,7,5
Extra,Tell them about it.,7,5
Extra,"As you know, the cameras on your phones are always on, whether you're using them or not.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?,7,5
Ben Wyatt,They are?,7,5
Extra,This app uses facial recognition software to track your expressions.,7,5
Extra,It's always watching.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Well, what do you do with this information?",7,5
Roscoe,"Well, if the camera senses that you're in a bad mood, then we could geomatch you to, say, the nearest cup of sweet pick me up java.",7,5
Roscoe,"But, if you're in a good mood, then we could geonudge you to, like, a sweet coffee shop.",7,5
Roscoe,You could just keep the good times rolling.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,So it's really just a coffee sales app.,7,5
Roscoe,Yeah.,7,5
Roscoe,"Yeah, we're developing with Starbucks.",7,5
Extra,Yeah.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl know all the things that someone wants?",7,5
Leslie Knope,"Are you guys, I don't know, whatever, datamining?",7,5
Roscoe,"Oh, hells yeah, dogman!",7,5
Roscoe,"Our super rad algorithm searches all your texts, calls, banking, medical records, blah, blah, blah, to learn what you really want.",7,5
Roscoe,"You know, from snacks, to new books and movies, to when you ladies need to score some new 'pons.",7,5
Roscoe,"I mean, we might know you better than you know yourself, Leslie.",7,5
Leslie Knope,How did you know it was me?,7,5
Roscoe,It was about 40 different ways.,7,5
Roscoe,"I mean, geomaps on all your different Gryzzl devices.",7,5
Roscoe,"And, of course, we facescanned you when you came in.",7,5
Roscoe,We're really glad you're here.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good.",7,5
Leslie Knope,Just 'cause we're competing for the Newport land doesn't mean that we can't be friends.,7,5
Roscoe,No.,7,5
Leslie Knope,Isn't that your motto?,7,5
Leslie Knope,"""Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?""",7,5
Roscoe,Totes.,7,5
Roscoe,And I hope that you can see now that there's nothing scary about Gryzzl.,7,5
Roscoe,"I mean, we just wanna learn everything about everyone, and track them wherever they go, and anticipate what they're about to do.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"These are really interesting issues, Roscoe.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"I think maybe we could debate them, you know, on TV.",7,5
Roscoe,TV.,7,5
Roscoe,Retro.,7,5
Roscoe,I love it.,7,5
Roscoe,All right.,7,5
Roscoe,I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.,7,5
Extra,Skate mode activated.,7,5

Perd Hapley,Who will win?,7,5
Perd Hapley,I don't know yet.,7,5
Perd Hapley,Which is what makes this a court show.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"We have public opinion on our side, and we have proof that Gryzzl has been datamining.",7,5
Leslie Knope,But there's one more thing we need.,7,5
Leslie Knope,The one thing that Americans respect more than anything else.,7,5
Leslie Knope,Public humiliation on live television.,7,5
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, do not go on television.",7,5
Donna Meagle,Swanson?,7,5
Donna Meagle,What are you doing here?,7,5
Ron Swanson,This is the 27th version of the Pawnee Gryzzl free wireless Internet thing agreement.,7,5
Ron Swanson,Check out the page I marked.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Gryzzl is not allowed to collect and use customer data for any purposes.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,It's pretty clear.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,See?,7,5
Ron Swanson,Look closer.,7,5
Ron Swanson,"Amendment C, addendum 14.",7,5
Ron Swanson,"It directs you to this appendix, which reroutes you to this one, which says, in a subfootnote",7,5

Leslie Knope,"Well, Perd--",7,5
Perd Hapley,It's Judge Perd.,7,5
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,5

April Ludgate,"I just thought, ""What would Leslie do?"" So I handed out flyers and I canvassed the college.",7,5
April Ludgate,I even baked a bunch of cookies.,7,5
April Ludgate,It was weird.,7,5
April Ludgate,I actually really enjoyed finding them.,7,5
April Ludgate,And I enjoyed bullying Jen into quitting.,7,5
Craig Middlebrooks,Hmm.,7,5
Craig Middlebrooks,You should add telling people what to do to your perfect job description.,7,5
April Ludgate,Good idea.,7,5
April Ludgate,"You should up your therapy to seven times a week, stop dressing that way and give me your wallet.",7,5
Craig Middlebrooks,"Victor Garber, James Garner, Jennifer Garner.",7,5

Lucy,Yeah.,7,5
Lucy,I broke up with Conrad.,7,5
Lucy,Which was a long time coming but it's still weird.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Yeah.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Do you want to talk about it?,7,5
Lucy,Thanks.,7,5
Lucy,I don't think I'm ready to discuss it just yet.,7,5
Lucy,But what I would like to do is have a glass of wine and talk about that shade Nicki Minaj threw at Jesse Eisenberg at the BAFTAs.,7,5
Tom Haverford,He deserved it.,7,5
Lucy,"No, he didn't!",7,5
Tom Haverford,Uh Settle in.,7,5
Tom Haverford,Because I have some very strong feelings about this.,7,5
Leslie Knope,They're all down.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,Sometimes I think they're somehow the first humans who don't need sleep.,7,5
Leslie Knope,Look.,7,5
Leslie Knope,"This Gryzzl thing, it's complicated, but this isn't Ice Town.",7,5
Leslie Knope,"You have done so much for this town, and people know that.",7,5
Ben Wyatt,I'm just sorry we couldn't find something illegal on Gryzzl.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,"If we're gonna stop them, and you're gonna beat them on the Newport land, we need more ammo.",7,5
Ron Swanson,We need to talk.,7,5
Ben Wyatt,What is that?,7,5
Ron Swanson,This is a flying robot I just shot out of the sky after it delivered a package to my house.,7,5
Leslie Knope,I thought you didn't like to pass judgment on--,7,5
Ron Swanson,The package was addressed to my son.,7,5
Ron Swanson,Who is four years old and does not own a Gryzzl doodad.,7,5
Ron Swanson,Somehow the robots looked at Diane's computer and learned something about my child and then brought him a box of presents.,7,5
Ron Swanson,So I destroyed the robot.,7,5
Ron Swanson,No one is safe from these bastards.,7,5
Ron Swanson,"Tell me what to do, Leslie.",7,5
Ron Swanson,I wanna help you take 'em down.,7,5

Tom Haverford,"Well, then you leave, Terry.",7,6
Tom Haverford,And pay for the cake you already ate.,7,6
Joe,I like the vanilla one with the lemon cream.,7,6
Craig Middlebrooks,"That was a joke cake I got from the grocery store, to weed out low quality palates.",7,6
Donna Meagle,"Maybe it's because he's my fiance and I love him, but I kind of like the grocery store one, too.",7,6
Tom Haverford,There's actually one more cake you haven't tried yet.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Donna has chosen me to be the Butler of Honor at her wedding.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Now, granted, ""Butler of Honor"" is a term I made up, but it's not a job I take lightly.",7,6
Tom Haverford,That's why I'm about to give her a surprise bigger than when LeBron went back to Miami.,7,6
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God.",7,6
Donna Meagle,DJ Bluntz?,7,6
Donna Meagle,What is happening right now?,7,6

Tom Haverford,"Oh, it's for real.",7,6
Tom Haverford,And it's the biggest one yet.,7,6
Joe,I still don't know what's happening.,7,6
Joe,"So, what's happening?",7,6
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self!,7,6
Joe,Not an answer to my question.,7,6
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, read the cake.",7,6
Joe,Still unclear.,7,6

Trodd,"Roscoe, people in this town are very angry about Gryzzl's data mining program.",7,6
Trodd,"In your opinion, have you done anything wrong?",7,6
Roscoe,"We did not believe that we did anything to invade people's privacy, Trodd.",7,6
Roscoe,"But then, we checked thousands of emails and texts between our customers and their loved ones, and it seemed like people thought we were wrong.",7,6
Trodd,Gryzzl's currently trying to buy an enormous parcel of land to build a permanent headquarters in Pawnee.,7,6
Trodd,How will you win back our trust?,7,6
Roscoe,We are gonna be throwing a free concert with U2 and Beyonce.,7,6
Roscoe,"Tickets are already on your phones, seating is gonna be organized by income and sexual history.",7,6
Roscoe,"And that, I swear, is the last time that we will be peeking inside your computers.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Gryzzl is scrambling.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time in this land battle, they are vulnerable and we are gonna capitalize on it with something big and exciting.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,I've got something big and exciting.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,All we need is a blimp and a decoy blimp.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"For what I hope is the last time, but we'll assume is not the last time, our strategy does not involve blimps.",7,6
Leslie Knope,We already have an idea.,7,6
Leslie Knope,April?,7,6
April Ludgate,Okay.,7,6
April Ludgate,Our new proposal will ask them to split the land.,7,6
April Ludgate,Gryzzl will take half for their campus and then donate the rest to National Parks.,7,6
April Ludgate,"It's not ideal, but they may go for it because of how bad they screwed up.",7,6
Ron Swanson,"I am not a spy, and I would never reveal classified information.",7,6
Ben Wyatt,Do you have to say that every time?,7,6
Ron Swanson,Yes.,7,6
Ron Swanson,But I know Gryzzl is dead set on owning the entire parcel.,7,6
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure this plan will work.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it doesn't, something will.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Because when you and I team up, great things happen.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Ron and I had a little falling out, but we are back, baby.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"And just like Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, we are totally in sync.",7,6

Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Just give me a... We're in sync emotionally.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Stop patting my head.,7,6

Ben Wyatt,Looks like Newport Trust is making an announcement.,7,6
Jessica Wicks,"Last week, the Newport Trust told Gryzzl, in no uncertain terms, that we would not do business with a company that invades our privacy.",7,6
Jessica Wicks,"Then, Gryzzl upped their offer to $125 million, and I swear to God, y'all, I nearly fainted.",7,6
Jessica Wicks,So we are officially jumping the gun and selling to Gryzzl for $125 million.,7,6
Leslie Knope,What?,7,6
Jessica Wicks,Let me repeat that because it makes me very horny.,7,6
Ron Swanson,"C'mon, Knope.",7,6
Jessica Wicks,$125 million.,7,6
Ron Swanson,How about we go drown our sorrows in some waffles?,7,6
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self,7,6
Lucy,"Hey, boss.",7,6
Lucy,"Before you go, can you sign some checks?",7,6
Lucy,Do mine first.,7,6
Lucy,"In case something happens to you, I wanna make sure I get paid.",7,6
Tom Haverford,Looking out for number one.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Always smart.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"So, how is post-breakup life?",7,6
Lucy,"Well, breakups are famously super fun and make everyone feel awesome.",7,6
Lucy,"So, it's no different.",7,6
Donna Meagle,You should come to my wedding.,7,6
Donna Meagle,It's gonna be hella fun.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, you should come with me.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"As, like, a plus-one type thing.",7,6
Tom Haverford,Maybe we just go as work friends.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Maybe it's just even, you know, boss, employee type thing.",7,6
Tom Haverford,You know what?,7,6
Tom Haverford,That's what you should do.,7,6
Tom Haverford,You should come to the wedding... And do paperwork.,7,6
Lucy,"Stop, you're making this sound almost too fun.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"Whatever, just text me when you decide.",7,6
Tom Haverford,I literally couldn't care less.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"So, yeah.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"Let's hit it, Donna.",7,6
Donna Meagle,"Um, can we talk about that disastrous interaction you just had with Lucy?",7,6
Tom Haverford,Nope.,7,6
Tom Haverford,All we're talking about is treating yo' self.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Today is about one thing.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Things.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Things, Donna!",7,6
Tom Haverford,Our favorite.,7,6
Donna Meagle,"Well, where is Bluntz taking us?",7,6
Donna Meagle,This is not the way to the mall.,7,6
Tom Haverford,That's 'cause we're not going to the mall.,7,6
Tom Haverford,We're finally gonna do something we've always talked about.,7,6
Donna Meagle,No way.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self.,7,6
Tom Haverford,In Beverly Hills!,7,6
Leslie Knope,All I wanted was valued at 100 million dollars given to me for free.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Is that too much to ask?,7,6
April Ludgate,I'll say it again.,7,6
April Ludgate,Voodoo is still an option.,7,6
Leslie Knope,No.,7,6
Leslie Knope,It's over.,7,6
Leslie Knope,They won.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Everything is changing.,7,6
Leslie Knope,This town is gonna be unrecognizable in 10 years.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Even JJ's Diner is disappearing.,7,6
JJ,What can I get you guys?,7,6
Leslie Knope,However many waffles it takes to keep you in business.,7,6
Leslie Knope,I'm happy with some of the changes that Pawnee has gone through.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the standard of living is up, we have pressed juice bars, and yoga studios, and a pet hotel.",7,6
Leslie Knope,But I think the town is losing some of its charm.,7,6
Leslie Knope,And there's too much kale now.,7,6
Leslie Knope,One place asked me if I wanted kale in my milkshake.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"My milkshake, you guys.",7,6
Ron Swanson,"Even though I'm a firm believer in the free market, and your failure as a businessman is ultimately to blame, it's still a travesty your diner is closing.",7,6
JJ,"Well, I agree with you.",7,6
JJ,But the guy who bought the property didn't even give me a chance to re-up the lease.,7,6
JJ,Can't win 'em all.,7,6
Leslie Knope,No.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Enough is enough.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"They may have taken that land, but I will be damned if they take my waffles.",7,6
Leslie Knope,JJ.,7,6
JJ,What?,7,6
JJ,Is something wrong?,7,6
Leslie Knope,"No, nothing is ever wrong here.",7,6
Leslie Knope,That's why we are gonna fight hard to save your diner.,7,6
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you said your new landlord didn't give you a chance to counter.",7,6
Ben Wyatt,Who is it?,7,6
JJ,It was a company with a weird sounding name.,7,6
JJ,Hang on.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,Was it Putin?,7,6
Andy Dwyer,"Voldemort Putin, of Russia?",7,6
Andy Dwyer,I'd love to take that bastard down.,7,6
JJ,Here it is.,7,6
JJ,"""Thigh Gap, LLC Owner, Dennis Feinstein.""",7,6
Leslie Knope,The cologne guy?,7,6
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, figures.",7,6
Leslie Knope,That guy is the worst.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,6
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take him down with an old fashioned public rally.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you to get the word out, with whatever method of communication young people are using these days.",7,6
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah.",7,6
April Ludgate,Tiny rolled up scrolls delivered by trained foxes.,7,6

Leslie Knope,"Oh, well.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll keep practicing.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody, listen up.",7,6
Leslie Knope,We're here today because JJ's Diner has been a part of Pawnee for 41 years.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"And this man, right here, built that diner from the ground up, with his own two hands.",7,6
JJ,That's not true.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""constructing a narrative,"" JJ.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"You stick to the breakfast, I'll deal with the politics.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"So, now, let's hear from a man who knows the value of things staying the same.",7,6
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.,7,6
Ron Swanson,I do not like rallies.,7,6
Ron Swanson,"And based on what I see from this vantage point, I do not like most of you.",7,6
Ron Swanson,What I do like is breakfast food.,7,6
Ron Swanson,"JJ's has very good breakfast food, so it should remain open.",7,6
Ron Swanson,Please do not approach me on the street after this event and attempt to talk to me.,7,6

Andy Dwyer,There's gotta be another way.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,"What if we steal the keys to Feinstein's building, break in, and TP his office, film the whole thing.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,We'd definitely get on a prank show.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I love your energy, Andy, but it's not gonna help us keep JJ's where it is.",7,6
April Ludgate,Does it have to stay where it is?,7,6
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a ton of buildings near where Andy and I live, and they're all super cheap because they're empty and disgusting.",7,6

Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.,7,6
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I understand.",7,6
Donna Meagle,Which is why I got you something.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're not supposed to get me anything.",7,6
Tom Haverford,This is your special day.,7,6
Donna Meagle,I didn't buy you anything.,7,6
Donna Meagle,What I have for you is a piece of advice.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Oh, damn.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"I was secretly hoping you got me the shoes Jaden Smith wears in Hitch 2, Son of a Hitch.",7,6
Donna Meagle,"My advice to you is, if you want to be with Lucy, you have to be upfront with her about it.",7,6
Donna Meagle,Be a man and ask her out.,7,6
Tom Haverford,She works for me.,7,6
Tom Haverford,She uprooted her whole life to move to Pawnee for this job.,7,6
Tom Haverford,I don't want to make it weird.,7,6
Tom Haverford,And what if she says no?,7,6
Tom Haverford,What if I'm the only one that caught feelings?,7,6
Donna Meagle,You won't know until you ask.,7,6
Donna Meagle,"Basically, Tommy, when it comes to matters of the heart, I say, ""Treat yo' self.""",7,6
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna, it's a great gift.",7,6

Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,7,6
Ben Wyatt,We tried to clean up this neighborhood so many times.,7,6
Ben Wyatt,Nothing's worked.,7,6
Ben Wyatt,"We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago, raccoons ate the wheels right off it.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and 10 years ago, when he was elected, he promised to clean it up.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name, Beachview Terrace.",7,6
Leslie Knope,A more accurate name for this place?,7,6
Leslie Knope,Medical Waste Butt Sweat Grove.,7,6
Extra,"Hi, sorry I'm late.",7,6
Extra,We've had this listing for seven years and no one's ever asked to see it.,7,6

April Ludgate,This place has everything.,7,6
April Ludgate,"Vermin, bullet holes, a hornet's nest.",7,6
JJ,"Look, I appreciate everything that you guys have done for me, but even if I put in the time and the money to refurbish this trash heap, it's not gonna change the fact that no respectable people live in this part of town anymore.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,Damn straight.,7,6
JJ,Everything would have to magically change.,7,6
JJ,"The whole neighborhood would have to suddenly become safe and clean, and have businesses and people who dine out.",7,6
April Ludgate,"No, then we'd have to move again.",7,6
Leslie Knope,Are you thinkingâ¦,7,6
Ron Swanson,It's possible.,7,6
Leslie Knope,But how would we... PR.,7,6
Ron Swanson,PR.,7,6
Ron Swanson,Which you could thenâ¦,7,6
Leslie Knope,Yes.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Right.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have about five days to do three months' worth of work, but if we pull it off, we can rescue JJ's Diner, we can establish a new national park, and we can save Pawnee forever.",7,6
Leslie Knope,Who's in?,7,6
Herman,I am.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God.",7,6
Leslie Knope,Where'd you come from?,7,6
Herman,The floor hole.,7,6
Lucy,Hey!,7,6
Lucy,How was your trip?,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Great, obviously.",7,6
Tom Haverford,Bedazzled that elbow.,7,6
Lucy,How was everything here?,7,6
Lucy,Uneventful.,7,6
Lucy,"So, I was thinking about the idea of going to Donna's wedding.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"Wait, before you say anything.",7,6
Tom Haverford,I don't think you should go to Donna's wedding to supervise catering.,7,6
Lucy,Oh.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"I want you to come with me, as my date.",7,6
Lucy,Oh!,7,6
Tom Haverford,"The thing is, you work for me, so it's probably kind of uncool for me to even ask.",7,6
Tom Haverford,Which is why I signed these documents transferring day-to-day operations of Tom's Bistro over to Craig.,7,6
Tom Haverford,He'll be your boss now.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Not me.,7,6
Craig Middlebrooks,It's about time.,7,6
Craig Middlebrooks,"We're losing the cranberry salad, effective immediately!",7,6
Lucy,You don't have to do this.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I do.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"You're great at your job, and I want you working here forever, and if you don't have feelings for me, I need you to know that everything is gonna be fine.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"In fact, forget it.",7,6
Tom Haverford,I wasn't even serious.,7,6
Tom Haverford,You've been hoaxed! You've been Tommy-ed!,7,6
Lucy,Just hold on.,7,6
Lucy,I was gonna say that I wouldn't wanna go with you as friends.,7,6
Lucy,I wanna go with you as your date.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Oh.,7,6
Tom Haverford,Cool.,7,6
Tom Haverford,"Craig, never mind.",7,6
Tom Haverford,You can rip these papers up.,7,6
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, I wish my reign had lasted longer, but I'm happy with the decisions I made and the people I fired.",7,6
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God.",7,6
Tom Haverford,I'd better get back there.,7,6
Roscoe,"You guys, I don't know what this is about, but it's 4:13, so you got seven minutes.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Well, we just wanted to introduce you to the new home of the Gryzzl campus.",7,6
Roscoe,Are you tripping? We just spent $125 million to build our new campus in the Southern Indiana Foothills.,7,6
Ron Swanson,"And you'll be spending another $100 million, at least, to construct the building, roads, plumbing, electrical.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"Whereas here at Beachview Terrace, you can take over five entire square blocks of historic Pawnee.",7,6
Ben Wyatt,Here's a complete proposal for Gryzzl's new regional corporate headquarters.,7,6
Roscoe,Is this paper? Super throwback.,7,6
Ron Swanson,My company inspected all the buildings.,7,6
Ron Swanson,"They are disgusting, I grant you, but the guts are solid.",7,6
Ben Wyatt,"We've laid out construction costs, retail space options.",7,6
Ben Wyatt,"You could build a much bigger campus in this neighborhood, and basically break even.",7,6
April Ludgate,"Plus, the best part, all the buildings come pre-graffitied.",7,6
Roscoe,That's true.,7,6
Roscoe,We wouldn't have to hire Banksy.,7,6
Roscoe,"Okay, but we spent hella skrilla on this trill forest.",7,6
Roscoe,So what are we supposed to do with that?,7,6
Leslie Knope,Here's a far-out idea that just came to the top of my brainium.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Why don't you donate that land to the National Park Service?,7,6
Leslie Knope,That would be pretty dope.,7,6
Leslie Knope,And you could get some baller tax breaks that could help you with that mad stank construction cost.,7,6
Leslie Knope,I don't know.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I can't.",7,6
Leslie Knope,I can't say these wordsâ¦,7,6
Ben Wyatt,You don't have toâ¦,7,6
Roscoe,"Okay, but why couldn't we just build the campus here, and then keep the land or sell it?",7,6
Ron Swanson,You could.,7,6
Ron Swanson,But donating it will give you some good PR.,7,6
Ron Swanson,Which you desperately need.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, we are glad that you picked Pawnee, but if you're gonna set up shop here, you need to make a covenant with the city.",7,6
Leslie Knope,Show people that you're invested in this town.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"Start by cleaning up one part of Pawnee, and preserving the other.",7,6
Roscoe,"Okay, well, I gotta talk to my board, as well as our chief legal counsel and our senior advisory team.",7,6
Roscoe,"And truthfully, they're all shrooming super hard at Coachella right now.",7,6
Roscoe,"But as soon as they get back, I'll get into it.",7,6
Roscoe,"We gotta go, I'm sorry.",7,6
Roscoe,We got a meeting.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,I'll catch you guys later.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,I've got a meeting as well.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,See you back at the house.,7,6
Ben Wyatt,Andy has a meeting?,7,6
Dennis Feinstein,Upload it to my GryzzlGlass.,7,6
Dennis Feinstein,Left eye.,7,6
Dennis Feinstein,I'm watching porn with my right eye.,7,6
Dennis Feinstein,Who did this?,7,6
Andy Dwyer,We did.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,"One way or another, Jonathan Karate always gets his man.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,"And like that, they were gone.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,"Go! Wait, where's-- Hey, guys, where's Gavin? Gav? Wait, stop.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,There were supposed to be six ninjas.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,"Where's Gavin? Gavin? Who was Gavin's buddy? Caleb, come on, dude.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,Why do we even have a buddy system? Is he in the bathroom? You need to tell me if Gavin is pooping.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,"No, do not laugh, okay? You're not even Caleb.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,You're Gavin.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,You're Caleb.,7,6
Andy Dwyer,"If you're Caleb, where's Hunter? Hunter! Hunter! Okay, who was Hunter's buddy? Hmm? Oh, I was.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, crap.",7,6
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Dennis, what a mess.",7,6
Dennis Feinstein,You have 30 seconds to get out of this facility.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ron.",7,6
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's been a week.",7,6
Leslie Knope,It might not work.,7,6
Ron Swanson,It'll work.,7,6
Leslie Knope,"But what if it doesn't? What if we did all that research and handed Gryzzl a fully-formed plan to revitalize an entire neighborhood and build a new national park, and their board still says no?",7,6
Ron Swanson,Then you'll be secure in the knowledge that you gave it your best shot.,7,6
Ron Swanson,But I do really think they will go for it.,7,6
Leslie Knope,What makes you so confident?,7,6
Ron Swanson,"A wise woman once told me that whenever you and I team up, good things happen.",7,6
Ron Swanson,"Also, they called three hours ago, said they approved the plan, and asked me to begin drawings for the renovation.",7,6
Leslie Knope,You jerk.,7,6
Leslie Knope,You sat on that news and let me stew here for three hours?,7,6
Ron Swanson,Yup.,7,6
Leslie Knope,You jerk! We did it! You jerk.,7,6
Leslie Knope,We did it!,7,6
Ron Swanson,Yep.,7,6
Ron Swanson,Congratulations.,7,6
Ron Swanson,I do not approve of this.,7,6
Leslie Knope,Don't care.,7,6

Ron Swanson,"If you'll excuse me, I missed out on the food, and was denied a fascinating conversation about Michigan limestone.",7,7
Ron Swanson,But I'll be damned if I don't properly honor the expression of romantic love.,7,7
Tom Haverford,Ron does this weird thing where he says exactly what he means.,7,7
Tom Haverford,You just have to ignore him.,7,7
Lucy,So you didn't mean what you said?,7,7
Tom Haverford,"Look, I'm all in.",7,7
Tom Haverford,That's all I meant.,7,7
Tom Haverford,"I didn't want you to think I was crazy or jumping the gun, and I know you just got out of a relationship so I don't expect you to feel the same way, butâ¦",7,7
Tom Haverford,That's how I feel.,7,7
Lucy,"Well, I'm only dating you for the free dresses, soâ¦",7,7

April Ludgate,"Well, then, welcome to the Terrordome.",7,8
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,7,8
Ben Wyatt,You need to tell Leslie that you want to leave your job.,7,8
April Ludgate,No.,7,8

April Ludgate,"One time, Andy told her that I was getting rid of my bangs and she called 911.",7,8
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,7,8
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I can't keep your secret much longer.",7,8
Ben Wyatt,"Any time your name comes up, I panic and change the subject to the Twin Peaks reboot until she gets bored.",7,8

April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking about changing the font on the itineraries. What do you think?",7,8

Leslie Knope,That's insane.,7,8
Leslie Knope,Don't mess with that.,7,8

Andy Dwyer,Assassins?,7,8

April Ludgate,I don't know.,7,8
April Ludgate,Nothing.,7,8
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could talk about your future.,7,8
Leslie Knope,You want to talk about your future?,7,8
April Ludgate,Yeah.,7,8
April Ludgate,I've actually been thinking about that a lot lately.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I figured.",7,8
Leslie Knope,It's hard at your age to figure out your path.,7,8
April Ludgate,I know.,7,8
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"I was going to surprise you with this in Washington, but what the heck.",7,8
Leslie Knope,It's unstructured chat time.,7,8
Leslie Knope,So Tada!,7,8

Leslie Knope,It starts here today with this flight and it goes all the way to 2022.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Cool, right?",7,8
April Ludgate,Wow!,7,8
April Ludgate,This is intense.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"I had to make some guesses about your ultimate government objectives and your fashion choices, etcetera.",7,8

Ron Swanson,"If she started soon, she could project manage our new warehouse in Snerling.",7,8
Ben Wyatt,"""Get to be my own boss.""",7,8
Ben Wyatt,"So far, so good.",7,8
Ben Wyatt,"She also wants ""passionate interest in subject matter.""",7,8
Ben Wyatt,"So, what kind of building is it?",7,8
Ron Swanson,It's a largescale storage unit for surplus vinyl sheeting.,7,8
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, that's boring.",7,8
Andy Dwyer,"Would she have an opportunity to practice any ""creative problem solving""?",7,8
Ron Swanson,Creativity is for people with glasses who like to lie.,7,8
Ron Swanson,"Although I suppose she could use ""creative"" ways to organize and stack the vinyl sheeting.",7,8
Ron Swanson,"No, that's insane.",7,8
Ron Swanson,We use the Towsend Method.,7,8
Ron Swanson,It's tried and true.,7,8
Ben Wyatt,I think this might be a dead end.,7,8
Ron Swanson,I think you might be right.,7,8
Ron Swanson,But getting a good person out of government is a worthwhile endeavor.,7,8
Ron Swanson,I will help.,7,8
Ron Swanson,"But first, I'm going to need some grub.",7,8
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!,7,8
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,7,8

April Ludgate,"Ow, it's hot.",7,8
April Ludgate,How did you make this so fast?,7,8
Leslie Knope,I keep a local bindermaker on retainer in D.C.,7,8
Leslie Knope,We are about to embark on such an amazing journey.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"This is going to be our city, and this is going to be our bench.",7,8
Leslie Knope,"April, we have a bench in D.C.",7,8

April Ludgate,I can't do this anymore.,7,8
April Ludgate,I don't want to work in government.,7,8
April Ludgate,I quit.,7,8
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?,7,8
Leslie Knope,You quit?,7,8
Leslie Knope,Why?,7,8
April Ludgate,"Because honestly, I don't even know if I like working in National Parks.",7,8
April Ludgate,Or government.,7,8
April Ludgate,"I just fell backwards into your world, and years have gone by.",7,8
April Ludgate,"And now, I'm here.",7,8
April Ludgate,And Andy and Ben have been helping me look into different jobs to figure out what I really want to do.,7,8
Leslie Knope,Ben who?,7,8
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt?,7,8
Leslie Knope,He's been helping you behind my back?,7,8
Leslie Knope,Wow.,7,8
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?",7,8
Leslie Knope,We had a good run.,7,8
Leslie Knope,But he's dead to me now.,7,8
April Ludgate,"It's just, I've been on this weird path my entire adult life, and I need to figure out what I really want.",7,8
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you're quitting.,7,8
Leslie Knope,And I cannot believe this is the first time I'm hearing it.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"And on our bench, of all places.",7,8
Leslie Knope,It's just so frustrating.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"I love her, but you spend so much time and effort on someone's life and she's just going to quit on me?",7,8
Leslie Knope,"It's like, what's the point, you know?",7,8
Madeleine Albright,"Wow, Leslie.",7,8

Leslie Knope,Yeah.,7,8
Madeleine Albright,Tell me.,7,8
Madeleine Albright,How many times have we had lunch?,7,8
Leslie Knope,Five.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, eight if you count all those times I showed up unannounced at your office with mini muffins.",7,8
Madeleine Albright,And why have we had lunch so many times?,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Well, because when I knew I would be coming to Washington to work, I wore you down until you agreed to become my friend.",7,8
Madeleine Albright,"I'm so glad that you did, and you are a wonderful friend.",7,8
Madeleine Albright,"But sometimes, you're so focused and driven that you forget about people's feelings.",7,8
Leslie Knope,Name one time I've done that.,7,8
Madeleine Albright,"Well, you were so wrapped up in your story that you actually ate my waffle.",7,8
Madeleine Albright,"Sometimes, all you can do is give people a little bit of advice and a push.",7,8
Madeleine Albright,But you have to realize April has to be able to make up her own mind.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"You're right, once again, Madeleine Albright.",7,8
Madeleine Albright,Can I have my pin back now?,7,8
Leslie Knope,Oh!,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, sorry.",7,8

Jerry Gergich,Okay.,7,8
Jerry Gergich,Copies are made.,7,8
Jerry Gergich,"Everything has been collated and stapled, and all the research has been doublechecked.",7,8
Jerry Gergich,I went through quite a few staples.,7,8
Craig Middlebrooks,I added a personal testimony vouching for April's brilliance.,7,8

Donna Meagle,"Uh, no one should.",7,8
Craig Middlebrooks,Do you want to go to dinner tonight?,7,8
Donna Meagle,I do not.,7,8
Craig Middlebrooks,Respect.,7,8
Jerry Gergich,I'm free.,7,8
Craig Middlebrooks,I have plans.,7,8
Ben Wyatt,"Well, great job, guys.",7,8

Andy Dwyer,"Sure, they did a good job, but this isn't enough.",7,8

Leslie Knope,"I really want all of my friends to be happy together, but more importantly, I just want them to be happy.",7,8
Leslie Knope,"If you feel like you need to move on, I totally get it.",7,8
April Ludgate,"Okay, turn around.",7,8
Leslie Knope,What? Why?,7,8
April Ludgate,Because I'm about to say something serious and I can't do it if I have to look you in the eye.,7,8
April Ludgate,Please.,7,8
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,8
April Ludgate,"Now, take your shoes off and wear them like mittens.",7,8
Leslie Knope,April.,7,8
April Ludgate,"Okay, sorry.",7,8
April Ludgate,"When I started working for you, I was aimless and just thought everything was stupid and lame.",7,8
April Ludgate,And you turned me into someone with goals and ambition.,7,8
April Ludgate,Which is really the only reason why I'm even thinking about what I really want.,7,8
April Ludgate,And I just want to say thank you.,7,8
April Ludgate,And I love you very much.,7,8
April Ludgate,Which is why I have decided not to turn you into a sea urchin.,7,8
April Ludgate,Which I could do because I am an actual witch with powers and I'm evil--,7,8
Leslie Knope,I know.,7,8
April Ludgate,And I hate everything.,7,8
Leslie Knope,I know you do.,7,8

Leslie Knope,I know some people who might be able to help us.,7,8
Leslie Knope,Come on.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"April, this is Alyssa, from the American Service Foundation.",7,8
Leslie Knope,"They take young people like you who are trying to explore a new path, and match them with one of the thousands of jobs across America that help communities.",7,8
Leslie Knope,"Alyssa, this is April Ludgate, the single greatest human being ever, and you need to find her a job that she will love and cherish and make her life feel complete.",7,8
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm sorry.",7,8
April Ludgate,I found this crazy woman on the street and she won't leave me alone.,7,8
Alyssa,"Oh, I'm very familiar with Leslie's enthusiasm.",7,8
Leslie Knope,They contacted us last year because they wanted to place some people in National Parks.,7,8
Alyssa,"Two days later, we had set up the entire program, and she sent me a throw pillow with my face stitched onto it.",7,8
Leslie Knope,Not my best work.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you changed your hair.",7,8
Leslie Knope,I'm going to send you another one.,7,8

Leslie Knope,No.,7,8
April Ludgate,I want to work here.,7,8
April Ludgate,At the Foundation.,7,8
April Ludgate,I want to be like Alyssa.,7,8
April Ludgate,"I want to tell people what to do, and then send them far away from me.",7,8
April Ludgate,It's perfect.,7,8
April Ludgate,And it hits everything on my list.,7,8
April Ludgate,"Creative problem solving, working one-on-one--",7,8

Leslie Knope,This is an amazing idea.,7,8
Leslie Knope,I love this idea.,7,8

Leslie Knope,"So, are they hiring? What did Alyssa say when you told her?",7,8
April Ludgate,Nothing.,7,8
April Ludgate,I didn't tell her yet.,7,8
April Ludgate,I wanted to see if you thought it was a good idea first.,7,8
April Ludgate,What? Bad idea?,7,8
Leslie Knope,You wanted to run something by me?,7,8
April Ludgate,Oh My God.,7,8
April Ludgate,Yes.,7,8
April Ludgate,"So, will you help me?",7,8
Leslie Knope,"April, you don't need me.",7,8
Leslie Knope,You can get any job you want all by yourself.,7,8
Leslie Knope,"Obviously, I'm going to vet your resume and we'll hold some mock-interviews and I'll choose your outfit and everything.",7,8
Leslie Knope,But you can get this sucker on your own.,7,8
Andy Dwyer,"So, long story short, we might have found you the perfect job.",7,8
Andy Dwyer,"But also, I might have blown it.",7,8
Andy Dwyer,Ben and Ron are there now to try to fix it.,7,8
Andy Dwyer,"And if they don't, I feel like it's kind of on them.",7,8
April Ludgate,Everyone is being so nice to me lately.,7,8
April Ludgate,It's weird.,7,8
April Ludgate,I feel like I need to take a shower in pig's blood to wash all the niceness off me.,7,8
Andy Dwyer,It's because we love you.,7,8
Andy Dwyer,We want you to be happy.,7,8
Andy Dwyer,This consulting job could be the answer.,7,8
April Ludgate,Yeah.,7,8
April Ludgate,"So, about that--",7,8
Ron Swanson,Please don't hold anything Andy did against April.,7,8
Ron Swanson,"She is an exceptional human being, who married a well meaning goofball.",7,8
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, and I think that presentation we put together says it all.",7,8
Ron Swanson,"All we're asking is that you meet with her, and seriously consider her for the job.",7,8
Ben Wyatt,"And if she disappoints you, you can hold me accountableâ¦. Right?",7,8
Barney,"You know what? If her friends are trying this hard, there must be something amazing about her.",7,8
Barney,Tell her I'll meet with her tomorrow--,7,8
Ben Wyatt,Hold on.,7,8
Ben Wyatt,April? Hey.,7,8

Mike Patterson,Excuse me.,7,9
Mike Patterson,Mike Patterson here.,7,9
Mike Patterson,"Leslie, you made it pretty clear that you don't think homemaking is important.",7,9
Mike Patterson,Do you ever cook for your children?,7,9
Mike Patterson,And who's even watching your children right now while you're out God only knows where?,7,9
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?,7,9
Leslie Knope,I'm standing right here in front of you.,7,9
Mike Patterson,"Okay, take it easy.",7,9
Mike Patterson,Let's not get emotional.,7,9

Andy Dwyer,My desk was right here.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Sitting right on top of it this whole time.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,How much money is it?,7,9
April Ludgate,It's not money.,7,9
April Ludgate,I told you.,7,9
April Ludgate,It's Ron's key.,7,9
April Ludgate,I hid it in here years ago.,7,9
April Ludgate,Hey!,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,No.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,No key.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Just a note and a movie ticket stub and four teeth.,7,9
April Ludgate,"""If you are looking for Ron's key, I moved it, and you'll never find it.""",7,9
April Ludgate,"""Cordially, April.""",7,9
Andy Dwyer,Where'd you put it then?,7,9
April Ludgate,I don't know.,7,9
April Ludgate,It was eight years ago.,7,9
April Ludgate,"Oh, God.",7,9
April Ludgate,A key to Ron's house is lost in a government building.,7,9
April Ludgate,It's his worst nightmare.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, babe.",7,9
Andy Dwyer,All we gotta do is train Champion to sniff out Ron's key.,7,9
April Ludgate,Okay.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,All we need is Ron's key to give him a scent.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,So give me the key and I'll get you that key.,7,9
Mike Patterson,Welcome back to the program.,7,9
Mike Patterson,"My guest is June Hartwell, wife of incumbent Congressman Paul Hartwell.",7,9
Mike Patterson,"Now, June, we all know what Ben Wyatt's wife is really saying.",7,9
Mike Patterson,"By skipping the Pie Mary, she's saying, ""Women who love their families are stupid.""",7,9
June Hartwell,"Mike, we all make certain choices.",7,9
June Hartwell,Ms. Knope chose to try to have it all.,7,9
June Hartwell,I chose to put my family first.,7,9
Mike Patterson,"Oh, I'm just speculating here, but do you think that Leslie Knope's actions indicate that she actually hates her family?",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Well, it only took three hours for Jen to be right.",7,9
Leslie Knope,I'm officially a distraction.,7,9
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna enter that Pie Mary.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"This is just nonsense, it'll blow over.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,And the Pie Mary is ridiculous and antiquated.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"But the more they talk about this, the less they're gonna talk about your economic plan.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I'm good at making pies, so I'll win and then I can promote my self-published women's rights barbecue cookbook The Feminine Mesquite.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.,7,9
April Ludgate,"I had it in a safe place, and then I moved it to protect it, and I don't remember where.",7,9
Ron Swanson,I see.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,"Don't be mad, Ron.",7,9
Andy Dwyer,"She hid it too good, and she left a string of clues.",7,9
Ron Swanson,It's an impossible puzzle.,7,9
Ron Swanson,And I love puzzles.,7,9
Ron Swanson,"A minimal, unhelpful note, these appear to be human teeth.",7,9
Ron Swanson,And what is this?,7,9
Ron Swanson,Twilight: New Moon?,7,9
April Ludgate,"It's a movie, but I've never seen it.",7,9
April Ludgate,"It's, like, about lame werewolves and vampires and stuff.",7,9
Ron Swanson,Donna likes those things.,7,9
Ron Swanson,Dollars to donuts this points us her way.,7,9
Ron Swanson,"Finally, a scavenger hunt worthy of my time.",7,9
Ron Swanson,Onward!,7,9
Leslie Knope,"Okay, snacks given, kids tucked in, books read, three simultaneous meltdowns for no reason, kids tucked back in, one of them briefly got outside somehow, kids back in bed, they're all napping.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,Good.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,I got everything you need for pie domination.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"I even got an extra whipped cream can, one for baking, one for directly into mouth.",7,9
Leslie Knope,You know me so well.,7,9
Leslie Knope,That might be one of the kids.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,"Hi, Leslie.",7,9
Elise Yarktin,"Elise Yarktin, from the Indiana Organization of Women.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my goodness, Elise.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Please, come in.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Wait.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Are you here to give me the Woman of the Year award?,7,9
Leslie Knope,I have a speech prepared.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see it?,7,9
Leslie Knope,Right now?,7,9
Elise Yarktin,No.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,"Leslie, we were thrilled to find out you were boycotting that ridiculous Pie Mary.",7,9
Elise Yarktin,But we just got word you've decided to enter?,7,9
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I agree that it's dumb.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"But this is not about me, it's about Ben, and he will do more for women than Hartwell.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, lose a battle, win the war.",7,9
Leslie Knope,That kind of thing.,7,9
Leslie Knope,It's the way to go.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,Look.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,"The Pie Mary is retrogressive and misogynistic, and if you participate, we will have no choice but to protest you and Ben at the event.",7,9
Elise Yarktin,Hope you like pies... In your face.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,Metaphorically.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,We'll be civil.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Elise.,7,9
Leslie Knope,There is no bigger defender of gender equality than Leslie Knope.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"And my husband, Ben, is a progressive champion of women's rights.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, the oven's ready.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Chop chop, time to get bakin'.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,Daddy want pie.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ben Wyatt.",7,9
Ron Swanson,We have a wonderfully small number of clues.,7,9
Ron Swanson,One is this ticket.,7,9
Ron Swanson,Did you see this movie about vampires and such?,7,9
Donna Meagle,New Moon?,7,9
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I saw it with April.",7,9
Donna Meagle,"She was so hopped up on painkillers from getting her wisdom teeth out, I convinced her to see it with me.",7,9
Ron Swanson,The teeth.,7,9
Ron Swanson,They're yours.,7,9
Donna Meagle,You were super out of it.,7,9
Donna Meagle,"You kept yelling ""Team Voldemort!""",7,9
Donna Meagle,At the screen and we were kicked out.,7,9
Donna Meagle,I was furious.,7,9
Donna Meagle,You only get to see the second Twilight film for the seventh time once.,7,9
Ron Swanson,Do you remember anything about a key?,7,9
Ron Swanson,Or April doing anything unusual that day?,7,9
Donna Meagle,She did make us stop by the shoeshine stand before we left because she wanted to drop something off for Andy.,7,9
Donna Meagle,She had a real bad crush on him.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Oh!,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Babe.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,You had a crush on me.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.,7,9
April Ludgate,We're married.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Still.,7,9
Ron Swanson,To the shoeshine stand!,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Chase me.,7,9
April Ludgate,Stop.,7,9
Donna Meagle,Garry?,7,9
Donna Meagle,What the hell are you doing?,7,9
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, gosh.",7,9
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I dropped my wedding ring down this grate, and then I was trying to get it out and I dropped my keys down there too, So I can't leave.",7,9
Donna Meagle,"Damn, this takes me back.",7,9
Donna Meagle,Mind if I stay and watch?,7,9
Jerry Gergich,Not at all.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,I appreciate the company.,7,9
Leslie Knope,The IOW does not mess around.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"Which normally is why I love them, but now I'm on the other side.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ben, I gave them 100 dollars in their annual pledge.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Do you know how many anti-me signs that could buy?,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"You just don't do the pie contest, obviously.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Then we're just back where we started.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Then it just seems like I'm saying I'm better than the women who bake.,7,9
Leslie Knope,What should we do?,7,9
Leslie Knope,Should we get a divorce?,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Well, how about this?",7,9
Ben Wyatt,What if I register for the contest?,7,9
Ben Wyatt,I bake the pie.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,I act as my own wife.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that could work.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate.",7,9
Leslie Knope,And then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,Exactly.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"But more importantly, we change the idea of what a pie is.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"I feel like that's not more important, but I like the energy that we have, so let's hear it.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, picture this... Crust on the bottom.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,Filling.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,Crust on top.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,What am I describing?,7,9
Leslie Knope,A pie.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,No.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"But you're in the right ""zone.""",7,9
Leslie Knope,Oh.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,Calzone!,7,9
Leslie Knope,Sure!,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Pies are just sweet calzones, honey.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,And I'm good at making calzones.,7,9
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,I can win this thing.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"Of course you can, baby.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Get in there and start baking.,7,9
Donna Meagle,I'm having some serious deja vu.,7,9
Donna Meagle,How many times have you lost your wedding ring?,7,9
Jerry Gergich,Too many times to count.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,And it causes real trouble with Gayle.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,"And any time I lose my ring, she turns into a real grumpy goose.",7,9
Donna Meagle,Is that so?,7,9
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah.",7,9
Jerry Gergich,"She'll say, you know, ""Garry, you'd lose your head if it wasn't screwed on tight.""",7,9
Jerry Gergich,And then she makes me go for the fresh oranges for the morning OJ.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,"And she says, ""Hey, Mr. Forgetful.""",7,9
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, those words... They rattle around here for hours.",7,9
Jerry Gergich,"That's why I've gotta be extra careful with this replacement ring, because if I lost--",7,9
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna order us some dinner.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand is gone.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,Or maybe it was never here.,7,9
Ron Swanson,They must have moved it during the remodel.,7,9
Ron Swanson,It's probably in basement storage.,7,9
Ron Swanson,To the basement!,7,9
Harris,Tighter.,7,9
Brett,"You sure, dude?",7,9
Harris,"Yeah, dude.",7,9
Harris,Tighter.,7,9
Harris,I can do it.,7,9
Ron Swanson,"Do what, exactly?",7,9
Harris,Nothing.,7,9
Harris,We're not doing anything.,7,9
Brett,And we definitely do not live down here now.,7,9
April Ludgate,"Guys, where's the old shoeshine stand from upstairs?",7,9
Brett,We don't know anything about that.,7,9
Ron Swanson,"Boys, think.",7,9
Ron Swanson,We are on a quest and we are not leaving until we get an answer.,7,9
Harris,"Well, we're on our own quest, which is to squeeze this just tight enough to make my eyes bulge out a little bit, but not so tight that I die.",7,9
Andy Dwyer,I've been there.,7,9
Andy Dwyer,That's a real tightrope walk.,7,9
Brett,Oh!,7,9
Brett,Hey!,7,9
Brett,Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.,7,9
Brett,"It had black hair, but you could see through his skin.",7,9
Brett,"It didn't like me, but that's just 'cause I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.",7,9
Harris,"Yeah, it said something about how it was worried Brett was gonna mug it.",7,9
April Ludgate,Okay.,7,9
April Ludgate,So we're looking for a racist ghost with black hair who likes shoeshines.,7,9
Ron Swanson,I think I have the answer.,7,9
Ron Swanson,The chase continues!,7,9
Donna Meagle,"Okay, wait.",7,9
Donna Meagle,"At the time that you told us you were mugged in the park, what were you reaching for in the river?",7,9
Jerry Gergich,A burrito.,7,9
Donna Meagle,That's right.,7,9
Donna Meagle,You fell in the river reaching for a burrito.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, ma'am.",7,9
Jerry Gergich,That was not one of my finer moments.,7,9
Donna Meagle,Ooh.,7,9
Donna Meagle,It's getting late.,7,9
Donna Meagle,We need to bounce.,7,9
Donna Meagle,I can give you a ride.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank you, Donna.",7,9
Jerry Gergich,Probably gonna get an earful when I get home tonight.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,Gayle might even call me the B word.,7,9
Jerry Gergich,"""Bozo.""",7,9
Donna Meagle,Wow.,7,9
Donna Meagle,We are very different people.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,Did you hear back from Elise?,7,9

Extra,"Let's see what Mrs. Wyatt has baked up for us, shall we?",7,9
Ben Wyatt,It's actually Ms. Knope.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"And actually, right now it's Mr. Wyatt.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie has her own busy life and I happen to be an excellent pie maker, so we figured we'd switch it up a bit.",7,9

Kipp Bunthart,"We are a men's rights activist group, and we are fed up.",7,9
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.,7,9
Leslie Knope,What's happening now?,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,Behind every successful woman is a man she has oppressed.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,First Leslie Knope poaches her husband's campaign by making it all about her.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,Now she's forcing him to bake pies and enter a contest for her?,7,9
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!,7,9
Leslie Knope,I'm not forcing him to do anything!,7,9
Leslie Knope,He loves to cook.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Yeah.,7,9
Leslie Knope,He has five personalized aprons.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,Oh.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,So I guess he was asking for it because of the way he was dressed?,7,9

Marshall Langman,Um.,7,9
Marshall Langman,Fierce alert.,7,9
Marshall Langman,"Eat 'em up, honey.",7,9
Elise Yarktin,The idea that feminism is an attack on family values is absurd.,7,9
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.,7,9
Joan Callamezzo,So you're defending Leslie Knope?,7,9
Elise Yarktin,No.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,Absolutely not.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,"Frankly, I don't think she's done enough to distance herself from this misogynistic lunacy.",7,9
Joan Callamezzo,Let's turn now to Sasha Dunkirk.,7,9
Joan Callamezzo,She is head of the group Women Against Feminism.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,What a surprise.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,The woman is only talking to other women.,7,9

Sasha Dunkirk,I actually agree with him.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,I don't need your pity.,7,9
Brandi Maxxxx,"Joan, Leslie Knope and I are united--",7,9

Brandi Maxxxx,"Leslie, if you're watching, I, Brandi Maxxxx, star of 69 Jump Street and Fifty Shaved Old Gays, have your back.",7,9
Jennifer Barkley,Oof.,7,9
Jennifer Barkley,"You really stepped in it this time, Knope.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,Why isn't the other candidate's wife being scrutinized like this?,7,9
Jennifer Barkley,Because June Hartwell is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.,7,9
Jennifer Barkley,"She started an awareness campaign called ""Bring a Sweater.""",7,9
Jennifer Barkley,"She calls it ""goose bump prevention.""",7,9
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on, you guys, you know the drill.",7,9

Jennifer Barkley,Done.,7,9
Leslie Knope,What?,7,9
Ben Wyatt,Apologize for what?,7,9
Jennifer Barkley,Doesn't matter.,7,9
Jennifer Barkley,Just say you're sorry.,7,9

Leslie Knope,"Recently, I made an attempt to--",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, hang on.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,Stop.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, this whole thing just makes me queasy.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"I love how independent my wife is, and because of that, I will not let her speak.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,That came out wrong.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, Leslie is a great mother, public servant, all-around person, and I am tired of everybody constantly telling her that she's making the wrong choice.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"So you can say whatever you want, I couldn't care less about the political consequences.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Well.,7,9
Leslie Knope,The first thing I'm gonna do is say sorry.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that the spotlight is on me and not on Ben, because he is going to make a great congressman.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Second, the Male Men. Where are you? Ah.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"You're ridiculous, and men's rights is nothing.",7,9

Leslie Knope,"""Why did I change my hairstyle?"" Oh, I don't know.",7,9
Leslie Knope,I just thought it would look better.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Or my kids got gum in it.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"""Are you trying to have it all?"" That question makes no sense.",7,9
Leslie Knope,It's a stupid question.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Stop asking it.,7,9
Leslie Knope,Don't ask it.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"""Do you miss your kids while you're at work?"" Yes, of course I do.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, sometimes I don't.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"And by the way, no one's ever asked me that question.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"No one asks me, ""Where are your kids?"" Or, ""Who's taking care of them?"" By the way, who is taking care of the kids right now?",7,9
Leslie Knope,"My mom, babe.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,Right.,7,9
Ben Wyatt,"So, maybe Leslie doesn't fit your personal idea of what a candidate's wife should be.",7,9
Ben Wyatt,"So what? That's good, because there shouldn't be just one idea anyway.",7,9
Leslie Knope,That's right.,7,9
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna bake a pie, that's great.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna have a career, that's great, too.",7,9
Leslie Knope,"Do both, or neither, it doesn't matter.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Just don't judge what someone else has decided to do.,7,9

Kipp Bunthart,I had a broken bike chain.,7,9
Kipp Bunthart,My bad.,7,9
April Ludgate,So I guess we are celebrating that you trusted me and I let you down.,7,9
April Ludgate,Great.,7,9
Ron Swanson,I change my house locks every 16 days.,7,9
Ron Swanson,That key has been useless since the second Tuesday after I gave it to you.,7,9
Ron Swanson,What matters is that I trust you and admire you as a person.,7,9
Ron Swanson,I will be sorry to see you leave this town.,7,9
Ron Swanson,For many reasons.,7,9
Ron Swanson,Not the least of which is that you created a puzzle that even I couldn't solve.,7,9
Ron Swanson,"And boy, oh, boy, did you love Andy.",7,9
Ron Swanson,"""Woof, woof.""",7,9
Ron Swanson,It really is embarrassing.,7,9

April Ludgate,I totally know where the key is.,7,9
Ron Swanson,How'd you remember?,7,9
April Ludgate,"""Woof, woof."" Bark.",7,9
Ron Swanson,Why here?,7,9
April Ludgate,Because this tree reminds me of you.,7,9
April Ludgate,It's strong.,7,9
April Ludgate,And quiet.,7,9
April Ludgate,And always here when you need it.,7,9
April Ludgate,Or whatever.,7,9
Ron Swanson,"I have always felt a certain kinship with April, and this is proof that I was correct.",7,9
Ron Swanson,"Not the nice things she said about me, the fact that I buried a large amount of gold under that same tree years ago.",7,9
Ron Swanson,I have since moved it.,7,9
Ron Swanson,Or have I?,7,9
Ben Wyatt,Elise?,7,9
Leslie Knope,What did I do wrong now?,7,9
Elise Yarktin,No.,7,9
Elise Yarktin,"Actually, we at the IOW loved what you said in your speech.",7,9
Leslie Knope,Really?,7,9
Elise Yarktin,"But... What we loved even more was how you, Ben, gave Leslie a platform in which to speak her mind.",7,9

Andy Dwyer,How are you doing?,7,10
Ron Swanson,My contract is very specific.,7,10

Ron Swanson,This one is constructed with American cherry wood.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Cherry, huh?",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I have just one question.",7,10
Ron Swanson,No.,7,10
Ron Swanson,The wood does not taste like cherry.,7,10
Ron Swanson,You cannot eat it.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"I was not going to eat it, Carpenter Ron.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,I was going to lick it.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Always remember, kids, when you find something new, you must lick it before you eat it.",7,10
Ron Swanson,"That is incorrect, in a number of ways.",7,10
Ron Swanson,"I sure have had some fun making things with you, son.",7,10
Ron Swanson,Thank you for everything you've done for the children of this area.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"You're welcome, Carpenter Ron.",7,10

Andy Dwyer,Let's learn something.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Professor Smartbrain!",7,10

Ben Wyatt,"Uh, listen, I don't know if you got my email, but I thought since this is our final show, maybe we not use the Boring Buzzer.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, kids.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,Today we're going to learn about geography.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you, Johnny, are moving to Washington, D.C.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,"I thought what we could talk about is how fast you could get there using an airplane, a train or a car.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,"Now as you can see, the airplane is the fastest.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,Not the fastest.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,What about teleporting?,7,10
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,"That would be really fun, but it's impossible.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Nothing is impossible, kids.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,Teleportation is impossible.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,It's about theoretical physics.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,You asked me to do this.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,This was a favor--,7,10
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Johnny!",7,10
Jerry Gergich,Mail call!,7,10

Jerry Gergich,"""Dearest Andy, I've never had a son of my own, and I just want you to know that for the past 10 years""",7,10
Andy Dwyer,It's time to karate chop something!,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Ninjas, attack!",7,10
Jerry Gergich,"Ah, jeez.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,Disperse!,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Remember, never attack a real postal employee.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,We're allowed to attack Mailman Barry because he volunteered to help us with our karate moves.,7,10
Jerry Gergich,I kind of thought I'd be holding a piece of wood or something.,7,10
Jerry Gergich,"But, you know, always happy to help.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Next up, we're going to try something new with my good friend Leslie Knope.",7,10

Leslie Knope,I am going to be taking over hosting my friend's TV show.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,Huh?,7,10
Leslie Knope,"Isn't that right, April?",7,10
April Ludgate,That is right.,7,10
April Ludgate,"Johnny, you have made so many kids and so many parents so happy that we wanted to give you a proper sendoff.",7,10
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer/ Johnny Karate, this is your life!",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, this is amazing.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to say.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Literally, because normally I have a script that I have to stick to.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,But I don't know what I'm supposed to say right now.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,It's kind of a nightmare.,7,10
April Ludgate,Okay.,7,10
April Ludgate,"You leave that to us, Johnny.",7,10
April Ludgate,"Uh, when we come back, we will take a look at the journey of Andy Dwyer.",7,10
April Ludgate,Stay tuned.,7,10
Perd Hapley,"""Now listen to some words from our sponsors"" are the words I'm saying right now.",7,10

Ken Hotate,"The Wamapoke people have a saying, ""Only one who listens hears the cry of the wolf.""",7,10
Ken Hotate,That advice has been passed down from generation to generation.,7,10
Ken Hotate,"Today, I give that advice to you.",7,10
Ken Hotate,Listen for Coinsy the Wolf at Wamapoke Casino.,7,10
Ken Hotate,"Twice a day, one lucky visitor will hit the mega wolf jackpot, and Coinsy will howl for you.",7,10

Leslie Knope,Welcome back.,7,10
Leslie Knope,"When I first met the man standing next to me, he was not a cultural phenomenon.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"""Phenomenon"" means ""to explore a cave.""",7,10
Leslie Knope,He was going through a tough time.,7,10
Leslie Knope,He had just broken both legs from falling into a pit.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,I was super wasted.,7,10
Leslie Knope,"It's a kid's show, Andy.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,Yes.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,Good call.,7,10
Leslie Knope,Kid's show.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,Good call.,7,10
Leslie Knope,"That event set in motion many wonderful things in my life, including the building of the Pawnee Commons.",7,10
Leslie Knope,"So, in a weird way, Andy, I owe it all to you.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"And now that the show is ending, I'm gonna have to start all over again.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully there's a pit in Washington D.C. that I could fall into.,7,10
Leslie Knope,Andy pulled his life together and he got himself a job at the shoeshine stand in City Hall.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,He then became a bureaucratic assistant.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, honey.",7,10
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hi.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,"He was always enthusiastic, but he also kept track of his appointments by writing them on his arm.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,Still do!,7,10
Leslie Knope,"To commemorate that time and to make sure that you never miss another appointment again, we have brought you a monogrammed day planner.",7,10

Andy Dwyer,Thank you.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,Aw.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I lost it.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,The day planner's gone.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,I can't find it anywhere.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,What?,7,10
Ben Wyatt,"Fitting, really.",7,10
Leslie Knope,"From then, Andy went to England for a few months to work for a nonprofit.",7,10
Leslie Knope,"It was there that he befriended the 14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, Sir Edgar Covington.",7,10
Leslie Knope,Tada!,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Eddie!",7,10
Andy Dwyer,This is amazing!,7,10
Edgar Covington,"Andy, I am here in this weird, flat place, to name you a loyal and true karate defender of the Queen's Realm.",7,10
Edgar Covington,Please get down on one knee.,7,10
Edgar Covington,"This honor is bestowed on those who have shown great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science.",7,10
Edgar Covington,"Therefore, I hereby dub thee a knight of the Order of the British Empire.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,Hang on.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,Can you actually do this?,7,10
Edgar Covington,"Well, technically, only the Queen can knight somebody, but I'm so rich that she lets me do what I want.",7,10
Edgar Covington,Would you like to be knighted?,7,10
Ben Wyatt,Oh.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no.",7,10
Ben Wyatt,Of course not.,7,10
Ben Wyatt,It's Andy's day.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, I don't mind.",7,10

Commercial,Be honest.,7,10
Commercial,This is what you want to eat.,7,10
Commercial,It tastes amazing.,7,10

Perd Hapley,"One of Andy's greatest achievements was the success of his band, Mouse Rat.",7,10
Burly,No one was doing what we were doing.,7,10
Burly,"Well, that's not really true.",7,10
Burly,We were basically playing covers of Dave Matthews songs.,7,10
Burly,So I guess you could say Dave Matthews was doing what we were doing.,7,10
Rivers,To play in a band like Mouse Rat that brought such joy to so many was... Truly was a mitzvah.,7,10
Rivers,"I should mention, I'm a rabbi now.",7,10
Perd Hapley,"For the full rockumentary, go to And now, back to the show.",7,10

Leslie Knope,"No, you did not achieve your dream of becoming a Pawnee police officer.",7,10

Leslie Knope,Take a look.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,My name is Burt Tyrannosaurus Macklin.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what the problem is, Sergeant.",7,10

Andy Dwyer,How about that?,7,10

Andy Dwyer,I'm a cop!,7,10
Andy Dwyer,I should get some handcuffs too!,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Give me your cuffs, Randy.",7,10
Police Officer,"No, no.",7,10
Police Officer,It's an honorary title.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Stand down, sir.",7,10
Police Officer,Quit it!,7,10
Leslie Knope,"Andy, now that you are an official police officer--",7,10
Police Officer,He's not.,7,10
Police Officer,"I want to make it clear, he's not.",7,10
Leslie Knope,You should be able to solve the case of the missing guitar.,7,10
Leslie Knope,"So, grab your clue and head on over to Professor Smartbrain.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Professor Smartbrain, this piece of fabric was found at the scene.",7,10
Andy Dwyer,Look at it under your telescope.,7,10

Leslie Knope,He has brought so much happiness to so many children in southern Indiana that we thought a piece of Johnny Karate should stay here in Pawnee.,7,10
Donna Meagle,Everybody was kung fu fighting,7,10
Leslie Knope,Raise it up!,7,10
Donna Meagle,Those cats were fast as lightning,7,10
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.,7,10
Andy Dwyer,"Can you believe it, babe?",7,10
Donna Meagle,In fact it was a little bit frightening,7,10
Leslie Knope,That karate gi will stay here forever.,7,10
Leslie Knope,"Well, not here, here, because this studio actually has a show where divorced couples work out their problems, so that might be weird if that thing was hanging over them.",7,10
Leslie Knope,But it'll be somewhere.,7,10
Leslie Knope,And the spirit will stay with us.,7,10
Leslie Knope,Forever.,7,10

Perd Hapley,Good evening.,7,11
Perd Hapley,I come to you tonight with some good news.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,Hey.,7,11

Perd Hapley,"Because, beloved Pawnee Mayor Walter Gunderson has died.",7,11
Leslie Knope,"Well, you jinxed us, Garry.",7,11
Leslie Knope,Thanks a lot.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,Walter Gunderson served Pawnee for 39 years.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,"And as per his final wish, his body will lie in state, in the city council chambers for a day.",7,11
Ben Wyatt,Which is just a real cool thing for a public space.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,"Also, he sent us a brief video message to be played for this event.",7,11
Walter Gunderson,"Hello, Pawnee.",7,11
Walter Gunderson,My time in office has come to an end.,7,11
Walter Gunderson,A lot has been done.,7,11
Walter Gunderson,But I wasn't really doing very much.,7,11
Walter Gunderson,I wasn't paying attention most of the time.,7,11
Walter Gunderson,"Fortunately, the citizens of Pawnee didn't pay attention either.",7,11
Walter Gunderson,"So, uh, if there's credit to take, I will humbly take it.",7,11
Walter Gunderson,"And if there is blame, it's your fault.",7,11
Walter Gunderson,Thank you.,7,11
Walter Gunderson,And goodbye forever.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, okay.",7,11
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that was really something.",7,11
Leslie Knope,"People are dying, moving, retiring.",7,11

Leslie Knope,We need something to begin.,7,11
Leslie Knope,And I have just the thing.,7,11
Leslie Knope,An underground dance competition.,7,11
Leslie Knope,I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.,7,11
Leslie Knope,But someone here will.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, April.",7,11
Ben Wyatt,Will you help me out with something?,7,11
April Ludgate,No.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, as city manager, I'm in charge of appointing an interim mayor until the special election.",7,11
April Ludgate,"So, why don't you just appoint yourself?",7,11
April Ludgate,You're basically running the town anyway.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I was a mayor once before.",7,11
Ben Wyatt,We all remember how that went.,7,11
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah, you completely disgraced yourself and destroyed an entire town.",7,11
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I said we all remember.",7,11
Ben Wyatt,Now will you help me find someone?,7,11
Ben Wyatt,It can be anyone over the age of 30 who's a good symbolic face for the town.,7,11
April Ludgate,"Fine, whatever, I'll help you.",7,11
April Ludgate,Okay?,7,11
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.,7,11
Ben Wyatt,I told Garry he could help too.,7,11

Tom Haverford,We even went to a jewelry store and looked at rings.,7,11
Leslie Knope,No.,7,11
Tom Haverford,"Shia LaBeouf is one hell of a jewelry designer, by the way.",7,11

Tom Haverford,I think I'm probably gonna wait.,7,11
Tom Haverford,"Plus, Lucy's not in town.",7,11
Tom Haverford,She's in Philadelphia visiting friends.,7,11
Tom Haverford,She gets back tomorrow.,7,11
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you'd probably want her here for that, right?",7,11

Tom Haverford,I'm gonna find April.,7,11
Tom Haverford,I got her a really nice Burberry necktie.,7,11
Andy Dwyer,Gunderson was mayor my entire life.,7,11
Andy Dwyer,It really makes you consider the postulence of time.,7,11
Donna Meagle,Sure.,7,11
Ron Swanson,"Death is natural, Andrew.",7,11
Ron Swanson,"We're born, we survive as long as we're useful, and then we're killed, either by our body's natural decay or by those younger and stronger.",7,11
Donna Meagle,Speak for yourself.,7,11
Donna Meagle,"Before I die, I'm freezing my head like Ted Williams.",7,11
Donna Meagle,"Wait a thousand years, thaw it out, slap it on a robot, Keep on ballin'.",7,11

Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so sad.,7,11
Leslie Knope,They worked together for a long time.,7,11
Ethel Beavers,I'll be brief.,7,11
Ethel Beavers,Walter Gunderson and his wife had an open marriage.,7,11
Ethel Beavers,It kept him happy.,7,11
Ethel Beavers,It kept his wife happy.,7,11
Ethel Beavers,"Hi, Evelyn.",7,11
Ethel Beavers,And it definitely kept me happy.,7,11
Leslie Knope,What is happening?,7,11
Ethel Beavers,"Because for 46 wonderful years, he spent night after night exploring every nook and cranny of my body.",7,11
Ethel Beavers,"Grow up, you prudes.",7,11
Ethel Beavers,We're all adults.,7,11
Ethel Beavers,My only regret is that I never told him how I really felt.,7,11
Ethel Beavers,"So, I'll say it now.",7,11
Ethel Beavers,"I loved that man, and not just because he was a dynamite lay.",7,11
Ethel Beavers,"Good night, you animal.",7,11

Leslie Knope,No.,7,11
Leslie Knope,Listen to her message.,7,11
Leslie Knope,You can't wait to tell someone how you feel.,7,11
Leslie Knope,"Because if you wait, before you know it Boom!",7,11

Tom Haverford,"We know we want to be together forever, so why wait?",7,11
Leslie Knope,Exactly.,7,11
Leslie Knope,And I will help you with the proposal.,7,11
Leslie Knope,What do you wanna do?,7,11
Tom Haverford,"Off the top of my head, I guess, my ideal proposal might be a multiplatform media experience.",7,11
Tom Haverford,"An action movie, with explosive graphics, fast cars and a hero with one mission, to propose to his lady.",7,11
Tom Haverford,A hero named Tom Haverford.,7,11
Leslie Knope,Tom Haverford,7,11
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!",7,11

Leslie Knope,"Oh, um People grieve in different ways.",7,11
Leslie Knope,"Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out ""Lucy, will you marry me?"", then you have no business calling yourself a pet store.",7,11
Tom Haverford,Why can't everyone share our commitment to the basic concept of outrageous pageantry?,7,11
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom.",7,11
Leslie Knope,I really don't.,7,11
Ian,"Oh, no.",7,11

Ron Dunn,"I've always found that when my soul aches with loss, it's best to turn to Eastern wisdom.",7,11
Ron Swanson,This is from the Isle of Islay in Scotland.,7,11
Ron Swanson,This is as eastern as my wisdom gets.,7,11
Donna Meagle,"Swanson, this handsome spiritual cowboy may actually be right about turning to the east.",7,11
Donna Meagle,I have an idea.,7,11
Donna Meagle,Trust me?,7,11

Ann Perkins,"No, you're supposed to crack them and leave them on your hair overnight.",7,12

Donna Meagle,Joe and I spend most of our time on the foundation.,7,12
Tom Haverford,I can't believe you went non-profit.,7,12
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you have betrayed me and everything we stand for.",7,12
Tom Haverford,You've changed.,7,12

Chris Traeger,"So, we're moving back.",7,12
Ben Wyatt,That's great.,7,12
Chris Traeger,Yeah.,7,12
Chris Traeger,I'm going to run admissions at Indiana.,7,12

Ron Swanson,"Well, you're getting the better end of that deal.",7,12
Ron Swanson,Tom.,7,12

Leslie Knope,"I've been so busy catching up with everyone, I haven't had a chance to ask them.",7,12
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, me neither.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's what I think.",7,12
Leslie Knope,I hate when we're on opposite sides.,7,12
Leslie Knope,It stinks.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"Plus, if one of us runs, it doesn't mean we're going to win.",7,12
Ben Wyatt,Right.,7,12
Ben Wyatt,And it's not like this is the only career option for either of us.,7,12
Ben Wyatt,"So, all that matters is that we are good.",7,12
Leslie Knope,Right.,7,12
Leslie Knope,Which is why I have an idea.,7,12
Leslie Knope,I think we should flip a coin.,7,12
Leslie Knope,I mean it.,7,12
Leslie Knope,Let's literally flip a coin.,7,12
Leslie Knope,Because whoever runs is going to do a great job.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"And whoever doesn't run is going to be right alongside the other one, offering advice and support and whatever they need.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"So, it doesn't matter.",7,12
Leslie Knope,So let's flip a coin.,7,12
Ben Wyatt,Okay.,7,12
Ben Wyatt,"You, Leslie Knope, the queen of planning and binders and pro and con lists.",7,12
Ben Wyatt,You want to leave this to chance?,7,12
Leslie Knope,Yes.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"Because whatever's next, you and I are in it together.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"So, let's go tell everybody.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"And they can participate and they can sign the coin and then, you know, the coin will eventually make its way into the Smithsonian.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around! First of all, I just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your children here, it's like It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"And secondly, Ben and I have an announcement.",7,12
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is running for governor of Indiana.,7,12
All,What?,7,12
Ron Swanson,"Bully for you, Knope.",7,12
April Ludgate,That's amazing.,7,12
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, she got approached by the DNC and they think she has a great shot to win.",7,12
Ben Wyatt,"Indiana native, supremely qualified, and she wrote that she wanted to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal.",7,12
Ben Wyatt,Just makes sense.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm running for governor.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"Ben is going to be running my campaign, because he's a super genius and he's got a tight, compact little body like an Italian sports car.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"But right now, I'd like to make a toast.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better.",7,12
Leslie Knope,That's what public service is all about.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"Small, incremental change, every day.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing.""",7,12
Leslie Knope,And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work.",7,12
Leslie Knope,Not to say that public service isn't sexy.,7,12
Leslie Knope,Because it definitely is.,7,12
Leslie Knope,But that's not why we do it.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"So, I thank those people who have walked with me, and I thank you for this honor.",7,12
Leslie Knope,"Now, go find your team, and get to work.",7,12
Extra,"In addition to Governor Knope's honorary doctorate from the School of Public Policy, in recognition of all she has done for the people of Indiana, the campus library will henceforth bear her name.",7,12
Leslie Knope,A [bleep] library?,7,12
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, that should do it.",7,12
Ron Swanson,The swing is fixed!,7,12
Leslie Knope,"Well, there you have it, sir.",7,12
Leslie Knope,Another problem solved by the hard work of dedicated public servants.,7,12
Extra,"Okay, great.",7,12
Extra,Bye.,7,12
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's about right.",7,12
Leslie Knope,Okay.,7,12
Leslie Knope,Well.,7,12
Jerry Gergich,Hang on.,7,12
Jerry Gergich,"Gayle made me promise to get a quick picture, just for old times' sake.",7,12
Leslie Knope,Good idea! Garry had a good idea.,7,12
Tom Haverford,Ugh.,7,12
Tom Haverford,The lighting is all wrong.,7,12
Tom Haverford,I'm going to send you a glamor shot.,7,12
Tom Haverford,Just photoshop me in later.,7,12
April Ludgate,"I'm not going to show up in that picture anyway, because I'm a vampire.",7,12
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, babe, for this picture, should I be Burt Macklin, Johnny Karate, or my new character, Sergeant Thunderfist, M.D.?",7,12
April Ludgate,Where did you get that?,7,12
Andy Dwyer,Found it in the sandbox.,7,12
April Ludgate,Ew.,7,12
Donna Meagle,Go Macklin.,7,12
Donna Meagle,Macklin's the hottest.,7,12
Ron Swanson,Get on with it.,7,12
Ron Swanson,I can't hold this smile forever.,7,12
Ron Swanson,I look ridiculous.,7,12
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, hang on.",7,12
Jerry Gergich,Okay.,7,12
Ben Wyatt,"You ready, babe?",7,12
Leslie Knope,Yes.,7,12
Leslie Knope,I'm ready.,7,12
Extra,That is a series wrap on Parks and Recreation.,7,12
