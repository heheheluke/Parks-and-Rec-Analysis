Leslie Knope,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"My name is Leslie Knope, and I work for the Parks and Recreation Department."
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a few questions?
Leslie Knope,"Would you say that you are, ""Enjoying yourself and having fun, having a moderate amount of fun and somewhat enjoying yourself, or having no fun and no enjoyment?"""
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna put a lot of fun.
Child,"Ms. Knope, there's a drunk stuck in the slide."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, this is a children's slide."
Leslie Knope,You're not allowed to sleep in here.
Extra,What is?
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I first tell people that I work in the government, they say, ""Oh."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government."""
Leslie Knope,"""The government stinks."""
Leslie Knope,"""The lines are too long at the DMV."""
Leslie Knope,But now things have changed.
Leslie Knope,People need our help.
Leslie Knope,And it feels good to be needed.
Leslie Knope,Could you put your arms to your side?
Leslie Knope,And that might help you slide down a little easier.
Drunk,We don't--
Leslie Knope,Do you want to come this way?
Drunk,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're gonna need you to get out."
Drunk,Can you please go away?
Leslie Knope,Get out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Drunk,You're Can you please go away?
Leslie Knope,Here we go!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wake up."
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Out of the slide.
Leslie Knope,"You know, government isn't just a boys' club anymore."
Leslie Knope,Women are everywhere.
Leslie Knope,It's a great time to be a woman in politics.
Leslie Knope,"Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi."
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,"You know, I like to tell people, you know, ""Get on board and buckle up, because my ride's gonna be a big one."""
Leslie Knope,"And if you get motion sickness, you know, put your head between your knees 'cause Leslie Knope's stopping for no one."
Ron Swanson,Tonight is our next monthly community outreach public forum.
Leslie Knope,And that is tonight.
Ron Swanson,That is tonight.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Ron Swanson,Leslie will be running it.
Ron Swanson,And we need one more.
Ron Swanson,Who wants in?
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Leslie Knope,This is a great thing for you guys to see.
Leslie Knope,This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.
Leslie Knope,"When I go through these doors, I need to be on."
Leslie Knope,Like the White House Press Secretary.
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,It's locked.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,What an amazing turnout.
Leslie Knope,My name is Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I am the deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as--"
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting in here.
Tom Haverford,Does anybody have any questions about permits?
Leslie Knope,"So, take two."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is department member Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,"We are here to answer any and all of your questions, so fire away."
Extra,"Well, it's a great day, because last month they put me in jail."
Extra,That's right.
Extra,The head of the police is a ninth degree Mason.
Extra,But the music is so loud.
Extra,"Stop the graffiti, please."
Extra,Please.
Leslie Knope,I don't like obscenities just as much as you don't like them.
Extra,"No, it drives me crazy."
Extra,I have kids.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Extra,"But I've got my little three year old, I'm going through the park and someone's like, ""Hey [bleep] my [bleep]"" And the guy's, ""You [bleep] my [bleep], you [bleep] head."""
Leslie Knope,"These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me."
Extra,"Now, I have a few things I want to say about Laura Linney."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, Barry."
Leslie Knope,Always great to have you here.
Leslie Knope,Anyone else who would like to contribute?
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, hi."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Tell us about that.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's a problem."
Ann Perkins,It almost killed my boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year."
Leslie Knope,"Twelve months, yes."
Leslie Knope,Go on.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, let me speak with you for a minute."
Tom Haverford,"So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"And, this guy, is it pretty serious?"
Tom Haverford,Are you guys living together?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you."
Tom Haverford,"You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken."
Tom Haverford,He's just weak.
Tom Haverford,You have to take care of him.
Tom Haverford,You probably feel like you need to move on.
Ann Perkins,What does this--
Tom Haverford," Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in"
Ann Perkins,Are you actually hitting on me right now?
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"God, no."
Tom Haverford,I'm not hitting on you.
Tom Haverford,I'm actually married.
Tom Haverford,"I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people."
Tom Haverford,"I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women."
Tom Haverford,I've spent a lot of time with them.
Tom Haverford,And I just-- I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.
Tom Haverford,Maybe we can just exchange numbers.
Tom Haverford,"You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this."
Ann Perkins,Look --
Tom Haverford,I'd love to do it.
Ann Perkins,"The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's government owned, and you need to do something about it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll do something about it.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we-- I will help you."
Ann Perkins,Is that a promise?
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of."
Leslie Knope,"Recently, I led a city-wide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats."
Leslie Knope,"But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam."
Tom Haverford,"No, that sounds great."
Tom Haverford,"Problem is, anything over 25 dollars I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me."
Leslie Knope,Morning.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Mr. Mayor."
Tom Haverford,That sounds good.
Tom Haverford,I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.
Tom Haverford,Bye.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, hello."
Leslie Knope,You were talking to the mayor?
Tom Haverford,"Yep, we were just rapping about some things."
Leslie Knope,Tom and I work really well together.
Leslie Knope,We're both outsiders.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a woman, he's a... I think he's a Libyan."
Tom Haverford,"I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina."
Tom Haverford,I am what you might call a redneck.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, brainstorm."
Leslie Knope,How do we make this park happen?
Tom Haverford,Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.
Leslie Knope,"No, parks are not a priority."
Leslie Knope,I need more firepower.
Leslie Knope,I need bigger guns.
Leslie Knope,You know what I need to do?
Leslie Knope,Form a committee.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, that could work."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen."
Leslie Knope,Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.
Leslie Knope,That's really good.
Leslie Knope,Write that down.
Tom Haverford,Yep.
Leslie Knope,"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down."
Leslie Knope,He's collecting them for my memoirs.
Tom Haverford,Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, read it back to me."
Tom Haverford,"Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood."""
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Sounded better when I said it.
Leslie Knope,"It's still good, though."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,What about bringing Mark on board?
Tom Haverford,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz.
Leslie Knope,Which Mark?
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that."
Leslie Knope,He's kind of like a fixer.
Leslie Knope,He fixes things.
Leslie Knope,"He's a smart, capable guy."
Leslie Knope,He just-- He knows where the bodies are buried.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Brendanawicz?"
Leslie Knope,You crazy old Polish person.
Leslie Knope,"City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you... Then you can't take it."
Leslie Knope,You gotta leave the locker room.
Leslie Knope,Let's get down to brass tacks.
Leslie Knope,I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.
Mark Brendanawicz,I just work right there.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule."
Mark Brendanawicz,I didn't clear anything.
Leslie Knope,"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, Lot 48."
Mark Brendanawicz,Condo developer.
Mark Brendanawicz,"He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt."
Mark Brendanawicz,I checked it out like a month ago.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's pretty gross.
Leslie Knope,What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?
Mark Brendanawicz,"A park, huh?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, it's not likely, you know."
Mark Brendanawicz,"But, is it possible?"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not possible.
Mark Brendanawicz,I would give up on that one.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Mark Brendanawicz,Why?
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's like a million reasons why.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Homeowners' associations, anti-government nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape--"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no way it can happen.
Leslie Knope,I can do this.
Leslie Knope,I just need a little help.
Leslie Knope,"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?"
Leslie Knope,Mark and I-- It's complicated.
Leslie Knope,"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen."
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did, like, five years ago."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I sort of-- No, but yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, we did."
Ann Perkins,"Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?"
Ann Perkins,'Cause they're gonna be here soon.
Ann Perkins,Can-- Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit."
Ann Perkins,I think it's probably just a photo op for her.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about--"
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm trying to watch TV.
Ann Perkins,I'm talking about the pit you fell in.
Leslie Knope,It's Ms. Perkins' house.
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I heard it."
Andy Dwyer,Doorbell!
Ann Perkins,I heard it.
Ann Perkins,I'm getting it.
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,Safety.
Leslie Knope,You remember Tom from last night.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ann, how are you?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, hey."
Ann Perkins,Of course I do.
Leslie Knope,"And this is our college intern, April."
Leslie Knope,She's going to be documenting our fact finding mission.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
April Ludgate,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Is this fun for you?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's so much fun."
Ann Perkins,I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,This must be our hero.
Leslie Knope,The man heard 'round the world.
Andy Dwyer,Uh-huh.
Leslie Knope,"How you doing, son?"
Andy Dwyer,Pretty good.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.
Andy Dwyer,Could you pass me my itch stick?
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Ann Perkins,"So, Andy jumped over this fence."
Ann Perkins,"He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,How did we let this happen?
Leslie Knope,"Dream with me for a second, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a first-class park?
Leslie Knope,"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field."
Leslie Knope,We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.
Ann Perkins,It's really not that big of a pit.
Leslie Knope,We could do some of those things.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna take a little extra work.
Leslie Knope,But why not try?
Ann Perkins,I think that would be great.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,I'm going in.
Ann Perkins,Why?
Leslie Knope,Don't worry.
Leslie Knope,I have a hard hat on.
Ann Perkins,"I can see that, but--"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"April, document this."
April Ludgate,Document what?
Leslie Knope,"The key to any factfinding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?"
Leslie Knope,It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, are you okay?"
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website."
April Ludgate,Could you just be still?
Tom Haverford,Don't move around as much.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, squeeze my fingers."
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Does it hurt a lot?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Mmmmmm.
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Ann Perkins,"No, you're not."
Leslie Knope,Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.
Ann Perkins,But it-- It fell off.
Leslie Knope,After my head hit that rod.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't believe you fell in, too."
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Ann Perkins,"It's not awesome, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle."
Ann Perkins,It's not broken.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, you're fine."
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, my clavicle's broken."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?"
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Are pancakes being made?
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No way.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I've been a loyal foot soldier.
Leslie Knope,Give me my shot.
Leslie Knope,Let me have Lot 48.
Ron Swanson,Is that a travel pillow around your neck?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you."
Leslie Knope,When you've been down in the pit-- Have you been in the pit?
Ron Swanson,"No, I haven't gotten down there yet."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have."
Ron Swanson,When you fell in.
Leslie Knope,When I visited the bottom of the pit on a fact finding mission.
Leslie Knope,"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means."
Leslie Knope,"And let me tell you something, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What it means is I want this subcommittee.
Ron Swanson,I've been quite open about this around the office.
Ron Swanson,I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.
Ron Swanson,I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
Ron Swanson,My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.
Ron Swanson,Like Chuck E. Cheese.
Ron Swanson,They have an impeccable business model.
Ron Swanson,I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I will definitely think about it."
Leslie Knope,I like the sound of that definitely.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, I presume."
Leslie Knope,Lot 46 thoughts? Yes? No? Me? Park?
Leslie Knope,Giving the park to me?
Ron Swanson,Still mulling.
Ron Swanson,She's insatiable.
Ron Swanson,She's like a little dog with a chew toy.
Leslie Knope,"All right, you guys."
Leslie Knope,"All right, all right."
Leslie Knope,I'll ask him.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wants to know what your decision is.
Leslie Knope,Someone on the phone about the park.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't think I even want it."
Leslie Knope,Oh man.
Leslie Knope,My clavicle's still really hurting me.
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,This is a great shot.
April Ludgate,I know.
Tom Haverford,That's awesome.
April Ludgate,I think she's crying in that one.
April Ludgate,Look at this one.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, kids."
Tom Haverford,That's another good one.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Brendanawicz."
Tom Haverford,You gotta come check this out.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside."
Tom Haverford,And we have some awesome photos.
April Ludgate, One.
Mark Brendanawicz, Is she okay?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, she's fine."
Tom Haverford, Oh! This is a classic.
April Ludgate, That's the best one.
Tom Haverford, The up-skirt photo.
Tom Haverford, Awesome.
Tom Haverford," Hey, man."
Tom Haverford, Give me the photo back.
Tom Haverford, What's going on?
April Ludgate,Don't worry.
April Ludgate, I can print more.
Mark Brendanawicz, Leslie is unique.
Mark Brendanawicz, Government work can beat you down.
Mark Brendanawicz, I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months.
Mark Brendanawicz, Leslie's kept hers for six years.
Mark Brendanawicz," I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules."
Mark Brendanawicz, I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.
Ron Swanson, Why should I?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You owe me one, remember?"
Ron Swanson,Do you want to cash in for this?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I do."
Leslie Knope,"So this was built in 1935, it's called Pioneer Hall. And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks."
Ann Perkins, Wow!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope, This is our crown jewel.
Leslie Knope, It's one of our best murals.
Leslie Knope, It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.
Leslie Knope," We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster."
Ann Perkins, That is horrifying.
Leslie Knope," Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope," So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could--"
Tom Haverford,Leslie! We did it.
Tom Haverford, Ron's approved our committee.
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, That's great!
Ann Perkins,That's so great.
Leslie Knope, That's so exciting! This is huge.
Leslie Knope," I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee."
Leslie Knope, I'm a rocket ship.
Mark Brendanawicz, Leslie.
Mark Brendanawicz, I just heard the news.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Isn't it great?
Mark Brendanawicz,Congratulations.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, I'm so excited.
Leslie Knope," It's exciting, isn't it?"
Mark Brendanawicz,It is.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Should I call a press conference now, or--"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, call one."
Tom Haverford, Definitely.
Mark Brendanawicz, I would.
Tom Haverford," Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered."
Tom Haverford, One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up.
Tom Haverford, She one time made out with the water delivery guy in her office.
Tom Haverford," On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman."
Tom Haverford, Not Batgirl.
Tom Haverford, Batman.
Tom Haverford, And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside.
Tom Haverford, And it is my favorite thing in the world.
Leslie Knope, You know what?
Leslie Knope,America is awesome.
Leslie Knope, It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys.
Leslie Knope, You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike.
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, You gotta be ready for it.
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Are you excited?
Ann Perkins, Definitely am.
Ann Perkins, Fired up.
Leslie Knope, Yeah!
Ann Perkins,I'm really fired up.
Ann Perkins,"You know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved? Well, I'm getting involved."
Ann Perkins, So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in.
Ann Perkins, Even if it takes two months.
Leslie Knope," Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista"
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Sweet Lady Marmalard
Ron Swanson,I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government.
Ron Swanson, This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger.
Ron Swanson, People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel.
Ron Swanson, Did you guys get a grant to do this? This is my basketball court.
Ron Swanson, I don't want to see any double dribble.
Ron Swanson, I don't want to see any three second violations.
Ron Swanson, Bobby Knight!

Leslie Knope,"Well, one of the funner things that we do here in Pawnee is the annual Easter egg hunt."
Leslie Knope,"Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say he did an exceptional job this year."
Leslie Knope,I've been searching for 25 minutes and I haven't found a single egg.
Leslie Knope,And I'm an adult.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I forgot to do that."
Leslie Knope,Maybe Tom's trying to make this year a challenge.
Leslie Knope,"And if so, he's succeeding."
Leslie Knope,I don't think a single egg has been found yet.
Leslie Knope,Let's keep looking.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find one.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to see my mom.
Leslie Knope,She's a big mucky-muck in the county school system.
Leslie Knope,She's my hero.
Leslie Knope,How do I explain her?
Leslie Knope,She's as respected as Mother Teresa.
Leslie Knope,"She's as powerful as Stalin, and she's as beautiful as Margaret Thatcher."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"In or out, Leslie."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Doorway is creepy.
Leslie Knope,"Right, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Choosing in.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"So, what do you want, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Just here to gossip, gab, chat, stuff we do."
Leslie Knope,"But it looks like you're super busy, and I am super busy, so I shall bid you adieu."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,I just remembered something.
Leslie Knope,I have my own subcommittee now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm sure you've heard something about it.
Leslie Knope,People are talking about it.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we're having a town hall meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. at the Smithfield Community Center."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm leading it."
Leslie Knope,It's no biggie.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it is."
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,You know-- You want to come?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, jeez."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You know how busy I am.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,That's why I fake invited you.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'll try to be there.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody's here."
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Mark Brendanawicz,Ow!
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Metal.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That's really loud.
Leslie Knope,Subcommittee members.
Leslie Knope,Are we prepared for tomorrow night?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, have you booked the hall yet?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, sir."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, did you clear your schedule?"
Ann Perkins,I did.
Ann Perkins,I changed my shift.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, I just have to say, I think you might be taking this to the public a little bit too soon."
Mark Brendanawicz,It literally doesn't matter what you propose to the public.
Mark Brendanawicz,"They might call for a vote, and if they vote you down, then you're done."
Leslie Knope,I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.
Leslie Knope,"I have a secret weapon, canvassing."
Leslie Knope,Nothing better than good old-fashioned door-to-door campaigning.
Leslie Knope,I'm not above using my expertise to change hearts and minds if the cause is just.
Leslie Knope,"When I was in sixth grade, I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes."
Leslie Knope,And there were only 63 people in my class. Andy fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,I fell into that pit.
Leslie Knope,How many more Pawnee citizens are gonna have to fall into that pit before we turn it into a park?
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Tom Haverford,Zero.
Mark Brendanawicz,Zero.
April Ludgate,A hundred.
Ann Perkins,Zero.
Leslie Knope,I've got some sunscreen for your beaks.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you probably won't need any."
Leslie Knope,Uh…. And this is our canvassing guide.
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be the script that we use when we speak with people.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""If a person is a man, turn to page two."""
Tom Haverford,"""If the person looks like a celebrity, example, Jack Nicholson, use this to help your pitch."""
Tom Haverford,"""Example, 'You can't handle the pit.'"""
Tom Haverford,"""That's why we need to turn it into a park."""
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,This is really thorough.
Leslie Knope,Ann and I are a team.
Leslie Knope,You guys are a team.
Leslie Knope,"We have even sectors, you guys have odd sectors."
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna win.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Win what?
Leslie Knope,Go!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, someone's in there."
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be fun.
Leslie Knope,Are you excited?
Ann Perkins,"Excited, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, definitely."
Leslie Knope,Are you pumped up?
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Look humble.
Leslie Knope,But confident.
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,We are representatives from your local government.
Leslie Knope,May we speak with you for a moment about the Sullivan Street pit?
Extra,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Leslie Knope,Positive response.
Leslie Knope,How would you feel if we turned that pit into a beautiful community park?
Extra,Oh.
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,That'd be a great idea.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,I actually live in the neighborhood So I could probably tell you a little bit about--
Leslie Knope,That's-- Go to section three.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Um, We are having a public forum tomorrow night."
Ann Perkins,"And it would be great if you could come, voice your strong support."
Extra,Tomorrow?
Extra,I can't.
Extra,I'm busy.
Extra,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we understand that people are busy, but we would love for you to come to the meeting and to…"
Extra,Sorry.
Extra,"Good luck, though."
Extra,I'm all for a park.
Ann Perkins,Would it change your mind if we told you that--
Leslie Knope,She's gone.
Extra,"Yeah, a park, huh?"
Extra,That sounds like a really good idea.
Mark Brendanawicz,Great.
Mark Brendanawicz,Would you be willing to come to a town meeting and show your support?
Extra,Absolutely.
Extra,"Now, is this park gonna have a playground or, you know, maybe a pool for the kids?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, how old are your kids?"
Extra,No kids.
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna put him down as a yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't do that.
Extra,"Also, is the park gonna be at least 1,000 feet from my house?"
Extra,"Because, you know, I really can't move again."
Mark Brendanawicz,"April, please stand behind me."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's it.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's all.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's all we've got.
Extra,No flier?
Mark Brendanawicz,Nope.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Wow, man."
Mark Brendanawicz,This is great.
Mark Brendanawicz,This is so great.
Mark Brendanawicz,I love canvassing.
Mark Brendanawicz,What a great way to spend my time.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Team Haverford."
Tom Haverford,"You guys are awesome, but I think I might work better as a solo artist."
Tom Haverford,"So, I'm gonna head out."
Tom Haverford,Peace.
April Ludgate,He runs weird.
Mark Brendanawicz,He really does.
Extra,It's a good idea.
Extra,But I'm just not sure.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Which part are you not sure about?
Extra,Turning the pit into a park.
Ann Perkins,That's kind of the whole thing.
Extra,"Well, look, I think this is a great idea, but I can't make any forum."
Extra,I would have to get a babysitter.
Leslie Knope,How old are your kids?
Extra,Four and two.
Leslie Knope,Could the 4 year old watch the 2 year old?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Mickey!
Tom Haverford,"What's up, buddy?"
Tom Haverford,How's my number one sod man doing?
Tom Haverford,"Look, here's the one, two, three of the situation."
Tom Haverford,"One, we're building a new park, two, I'm on the committee, three, you're putting in the sod."
Tom Haverford,"And who knows, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"Maybe, down the line, a situation will arise where you could hook me up."
Tom Haverford,"Are you gonna commit to coming to this meeting tomorrow, or are you gonna be a bitch?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, you do owe me."
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Keep going, keep moving."
Leslie Knope,Nose to the grindstone.
Leslie Knope,No means yes.
Ann Perkins,"Can we stop, please?"
Ann Perkins,"Because it's really hot, and I'm tired."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm hot, too."
Leslie Knope,Let's blow on each other's faces.
Leslie Knope,Or we could drink some water.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's do that."
Ann Perkins,My house is really close by.
Ann Perkins,Let's just go take a break for an hour or so.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I didn't want it to have to come to this, but, Ann, please open the sealed envelope that's in your binder."
Leslie Knope,This is a little something I learned from Karl Rove.
Leslie Knope,"If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want."
Ann Perkins,"""Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?"""
Ann Perkins,That seems iffy.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
Leslie Knope,"Wouldn't you agree, like most decent Americans, that it would be a good idea to turn the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street into a beautiful community park?"
Extra,Oh.
Extra,"Actually, no."
Extra,I'm not really a fan of parks.
Extra,"Very noisy, barbecue smell all the time."
Leslie Knope,Would you change your mind if I told you that nine out of 10 meth users said the same exact thing?
Extra,What?
Extra,How would you even know that?
Leslie Knope,Survey.
Leslie Knope,We surveyed crystal meth users.
Ann Perkins,We're actually having a little town meeting tomorrow night if you wanted to just--
Extra,"Look, I know it sounds weird, but I just don't like living near parks."
Extra,"So if you have a flier or something, I'd be happy to take it."
Extra,Thank you.
Extra,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park!
Extra,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,"It's-- What I mean is, kids love parks and you should, too."
Extra,"So, if I don't support your little project, then I don't love my daughter?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't--
Extra,"What time is this thing, anyway?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's next month, forget about it."
Extra,"Oh, it's tomorrow night."
Extra,I'll be there.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Come on.
Leslie Knope,We got one.
Extra,Come on.
Tom Haverford,Am I talking to the two sexiest thighs in landscaping?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am, 'cause I'm talking to Marcy."
Tom Haverford,How's it going?
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Kevin, your sandboxes are the best."
Tom Haverford,That's why I want you involved!
Tom Haverford,I just want the best monkey bars I can get in my park.
Tom Haverford,I don't mind hooking you up.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe, down the line, there'll be a situation where you can hook me up."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for your time, sir."
Leslie Knope,"Hmm, he said some upsetting things."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you gave him your home phone number.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a public servant."
Leslie Knope,I need to be accessible.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with people?
Ann Perkins,I should show them Andy's medical bills.
Ann Perkins,Maybe they'd have a little sympathy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Game changer.
Leslie Knope,You just busted the game wide open.
Ann Perkins,How?
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,We need Andy.
Leslie Knope,He's our symbol.
Leslie Knope,We'll wheel him around the neighborhood to get sympathy.
Leslie Knope,He's a cute FDR.
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Paul,"Ron, you got a minute?"
Ron Swanson,"Uh, sure, Paul."
Ron Swanson,What can I do for you?
Paul,The Sullivan Street Park project.
Paul,"You fast-tracked it, right?"
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, absolutely."
Ron Swanson,We have a public forum tomorrow.
Paul,Okay.
Paul,Great.
Paul,I'll be there.
Ron Swanson,Great.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,"""Hey! You fast-tracked that, right?"""
Paul,I'm sorry?
Paul,Did you say something?
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Paul,You didn't say anything to me?
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,There's a new wind blowing in government and I don't like it.
Ron Swanson,"All of a sudden, there's all this federal money coming in, and Paul, the city manager, is telling us to build parks and start new community programs."
Ron Swanson,It's horrifying.
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a nurse's costume?"
Ann Perkins,Costume?
Ann Perkins,"You mean, like, scrubs?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, put those on."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Please tell me, Please tell me why, My car is in the front yard, Bass!"
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm sleeping with my clothes on I came in through the window last night
Mark Brendanawicz,It can be tricky dealing
Leslie Knope, Don't-- Why do I want to build this park so bad?
Leslie Knope,Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.
Leslie Knope,"You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there."
Leslie Knope,"""Hey, Vlad! Look at these rocks! Let's pretend they're potatoes!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Nikolai! Do you want to swim in the dirt?"""
Leslie Knope,But not here.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.
Leslie Knope,And it is my dream to build a park.
Leslie Knope,That I one day visit with my White House staff on my birthday.
Leslie Knope,"And they say, ""President Knope, this park is awesome."""
Leslie Knope,"""Now we understand why you are the first female President of the United States."""
Ron Swanson,"Leslie Knope, builder of parks."
Ron Swanson,How was canvassing?
Leslie Knope,"Canvassing was okay, but I think we're gonna have to postpone the town meeting."
Ron Swanson,Postpone?
Leslie Knope,Only for 1 to 90 days.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,You're doing this meeting.
Ron Swanson,You have my full support.
Ron Swanson,"I was talking to the city manager, exchanging ideas."
Ron Swanson,"Um, there's a mutual respect there."
Ron Swanson,"And together, we have decided to fast-track your project."
Leslie Knope,City manager?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I have to cancel this meeting.
Leslie Knope,Fast-track?
Leslie Knope,Did my name come up at all?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this meeting needs to be canceled."
Ron Swanson,"No, it's happening."
Ron Swanson,"Look, just do a good job tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Ron Swanson,We have to push this thing through.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,I'll push anything through anything.
Leslie Knope,You know me.
Ron Swanson,Are you sweating through your suit?
Leslie Knope,I doubt it.
Leslie Knope,It's a very breathable fabric--
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I am.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, what's up, man?"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're into pretzels, right?"
Tom Haverford,Bam!
Tom Haverford,"Hit them up, man."
Tom Haverford,Thanks for coming down.
Tom Haverford,I got a seat taped off for you over there.
Tom Haverford,"My top priority with this park, getting your fences in there."
Tom Haverford,I drove by one of your fences the other day.
Tom Haverford,"I was like, ""Man, that fence looks awesome."""
Tom Haverford,"I was like, of course, Roy's."
Tom Haverford,"If you're into chocolate muffins, grab as many you want."
Tom Haverford,Some people may say that bringing in these contractors this early is jumping the gun a little bit.
Tom Haverford,"Well, guess what?"
Tom Haverford,"Here's the gun, here's me."
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,Victor Miles.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Tom Haverford,Thank you so much for coming down.
Tom Haverford,I want to introduce you to Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Victor Miles.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Tom Haverford,He's a gentleman I met canvassing.
Tom Haverford,He also happens to be the top sod guy in Indiana.
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Paul,"Hey, Leslie."
Paul,Hey.
Paul,I really want you to nail this.
Tom Haverford,Don from Don's Cement.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.
Tom Haverford,I was thinking of a jingle for your company.
Tom Haverford,How's this?
Tom Haverford,Don's cement It's the best you can get Don's
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Andy came, too, to give his support."
Andy Dwyer,"I have a lot of stage experience, so…"
Ann Perkins,"This will be fine, right?"
Andy Dwyer,It's a park for God's sakes.
Andy Dwyer,How much can they hate a park?
Ann Perkins,A lot of them seemed to hate a park yesterday.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you in the audience."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, and if the questions start getting negative, I'm gonna call on you."
Leslie Knope,And I need you to sell the crap out of the park.
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
April Ludgate,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Please, April!"
Leslie Knope,This is serious!
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
April Ludgate,Probably.
Leslie Knope,"Good girl, good girl, good ""probably."""
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go."
Leslie Knope,"Line up, everybody."
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,My mom's here.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I can't do that.
Leslie Knope,That's illegal.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming out tonight.
Leslie Knope,This is our first town meeting about the proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street into a community park.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,This is gonna be a train wreck.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, ""There's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother."""
Leslie Knope,"Now, there are many people that I spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope,"None of them were able to make it tonight, unfortunately."
Leslie Knope,But they totally exist.
Leslie Knope,I did not make them up.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I see a question."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No questions right now.
Kate Spivack,My name is Kate Spivack.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I remember you.
Kate Spivack,And I live in the neighborhood.
Kate Spivack,And I am 100% against this park.
Kate Spivack,"I cannot believe the department is moving forward with a project without a single environmental impact study, and if you guys agree with me, let's take a stand."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We are a little ahead of schedule, because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon, which I was warned about by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner assigned to this project."
Leslie Knope,"Uh... So, what would he say?"
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, should I give them some background info on the site?"
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanawicz knows the answer to every question.
Leslie Knope,He's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi there.
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie might have oversold me a little bit.
Leslie Knope,Certainly did not.
Leslie Knope,He's the man.
Leslie Knope,He's capable of anything.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Lot 48 is It's a rectangular lot.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's got excellent drainage.
Mark Brendanawicz,And it's on the corner of Sullivan and Collins.
Mark Brendanawicz, Any questions?
Lawrence,I have more of a comment than a question.
Mark Brendanawicz, Go for it.
Lawrence, It's for the guy in the casts.
Andy Dwyer," Here we go, Lawrence."
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Leslie Knope, That is Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope, He is a local resident and he tragically fell in the pit.
Lawrence," Uh, yeah."
Lawrence, I don't care about any of that.
Lawrence, He's the guy that plays music all night in his garage.
Lawrence, It's driving me nuts.
Andy Dwyer, Lawrence lives with his grandma.
Andy Dwyer, Which is pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer," He takes care of her, I guess."
Andy Dwyer," But whatever, he's a douchebag."
Lawrence," It's loud, it's abusive, and it's waking up my birds."
Andy Dwyer," You have birds, now?"
Lawrence,"Yeah, I have birds."
Lawrence," I have nice, pretty, expensive birds, and you play that music, and it wakes them up."
Andy Dwyer," Look, I don't work for the government, okay? Uh, I do play rock and roll."
Andy Dwyer, Guilty as charged.
Andy Dwyer, I'm in a band.
Andy Dwyer, It's called Just the Tip.
Andy Dwyer," And actually, if anyone here plays bass, we need a bassist."
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Leslie Knope," Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we?"
Ron Swanson,Uh.
Ron Swanson, It is not going well at all.
Leslie Knope, Mmm-hmm.
Ron Swanson, It's going very poorly.
Ron Swanson, Okay?
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Ron Swanson," Like, you're crashing and burning."
Leslie Knope, Democracy's happening.
Leslie Knope, People are talking.
Leslie Knope," I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right?"
Ron Swanson,You're right about that.
Ron Swanson, They're deeply negative.
Ron Swanson," You need to put a happy face on this, give me a few positive talking points, and whatever you do, avoid a vote."
Tom Haverford, I'm oddly attracted to Kate Spivack.
Leslie Knope," Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope," The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox."
Leslie Knope," He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death."
Leslie Knope, Flash forward to 1969.
Leslie Knope, Man walks on the moon.
Leslie Knope, Pawnee is lousy with hippies--
Paul,"My, God."
Paul, She's filibustering her own meeting.
Leslie Knope, Filibuster! Boom! They can't touch you if you talk forever.
Leslie Knope," I can't speak of the future, but I will."
Leslie Knope," The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words."
Leslie Knope," And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster."
Kate Spivack, Excuse me? Can't you read that children's book on your own time?
Leslie Knope,"I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but"""
Kate Spivack,"Okay, all right."
Kate Spivack," You know what? This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think."
Leslie Knope," Well, you did already talk, ma'am."
Leslie Knope, And I would love to listen to someone else.
Leslie Knope, Someone I don't know.
Leslie Knope, Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top.
Leslie Knope, Could you tell us how you feel about this park? Go ahead.
April Ludgate, Hi.
April Ludgate," Uh, I'm a youth in the community and I think a new park is a great idea."
April Ludgate," And I fully support it, as would the rest of the youth in the community."
Lawrence, Hey! I recognize her.
Lawrence, That kid came to my door yesterday.
Kate Spivack," Oh, my God! Okay, they have planted people in this audience."
Kate Spivack, Unbelievable! You know what? We all agree that this park is a bad idea.
Kate Spivack, We should just take a vote.
Kate Spivack, Right? Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we will take a vote."
Leslie Knope," Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you."
Leslie Knope, One by one.
Ann Perkins,That was brutal.
Ann Perkins," A couple of weeks ago, I was yelling at Leslie at a public forum."
Ann Perkins," God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious as those people."
Ann Perkins," I wasn't, right?"
Extra,"At 5:00 in the morning, every morning, beep, beep, beep! I don't want to hear that."
Extra," Now, how long is this project gonna take? That's what I want to know."
Extra, That's what's important to me.
Extra, Because I need my sleep.
Extra, I put some
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope," Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope, That concludes our meeting.
Kate Spivack, What about the vote?
Leslie Knope,We're out of time.
Leslie Knope, It's 9 o' clock.
Leslie Knope," But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there."
Leslie Knope, Thank you so much for coming.
Leslie Knope,It was tough.
Leslie Knope," But, you know, that's Pawnee."
Leslie Knope, That's democracy.
Leslie Knope, There are a lot of people here that want this park.
Leslie Knope, You just gotta get past the negative people.
Leslie Knope, But guess what? My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.
Leslie Knope," God, I loved it! I loved every minute of it."
Lawrence," Hey, park lady."
Leslie Knope, Yeah?
Lawrence,You suck.
Leslie Knope," Hear that? He called me ""park lady."""
Tom Haverford,"You know, normally, I don't agree with Leslie about anything, but this book is awesome."

,Season: 1 Episode: 03
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now, see, here's a good example of a plant that you can't eat."
Jerry Gergich,See all the spikes?
Jerry Gergich,"So, two things."
Jerry Gergich,"One, it's poisonous."
Jerry Gergich,"And two, it would hurt."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department has so many programs.
Leslie Knope,Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.
Leslie Knope,"For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant."
Jerry Gergich,"Look what we have here, country honeysuckle, Pawnee style."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, take a look at that."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,It's pretty and it smells good.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Smells great.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, it's really nice."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,That's bitter.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you don't eat it."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Why did you let me eat that?
Jerry Gergich,I never told you to eat that.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,God.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, the animals know you don't eat the country honeysuckle."
Leslie Knope,I'm not an animal.
Leslie Knope,My tongue is swelling up.
Jerry Gergich,"No, don't touch it!"
Jerry Gergich,"No, you can't-- Okay, now you'll have to throw that away."
Leslie Knope,Let's not scare the kids.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, there we go then."
Jerry Gergich,Let's see what else is here.
Leslie Knope,"So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though."
Leslie Knope,So I have a piece of good news.
Leslie Knope,I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.
Leslie Knope,"She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post."
Ann Perkins,That sounds really good.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,It is a classic strategy.
Leslie Knope,The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project."
Leslie Knope,The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.
Leslie Knope,"We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding."
Leslie Knope,"To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises."
Leslie Knope,One penis in particular.
Leslie Knope,"Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,"Rule number one, stay on message."
Leslie Knope,This is key.
Leslie Knope,"All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park."
Leslie Knope,And that's it.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Number two: What?
Leslie Knope,Stay on message again?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's that important."
Leslie Knope,It's one and two.
Leslie Knope,Stay on message and stay on message.
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,"Stay on what, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,Message.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week, which is really impressive."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, until now, my only experience with government was trying to get a recycling bin."
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,Did I ever get it?
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Buy you a cup of coffee?
Leslie Knope,"This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial meeting place of Pawnee's political elite."
Leslie Knope,The people who eat here basically run this town.
Leslie Knope,"So, listen, I was hoping maybe I could pick your brain about how to deal with the media."
Leslie Knope,It's my first interview.
Mark Brendanawicz,What about that thing you did for the middle school newspaper last year?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I don't count that.
Leslie Knope,That was a smear job.
Leslie Knope,So I put together some discussion topics.
Leslie Knope,Can I run them by you?
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What do you think her opening gambit is gonna be?
Leslie Knope,What is she gonna ask me first?
Mark Brendanawicz,How you spell your name.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,"Because of the silent ""K."""
Leslie Knope,You're so smart.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building--"
Mark Brendanawicz,How many discussion questions do you have there?
Leslie Knope,Um Thirty.
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow!
Mark Brendanawicz,You're insane.
Leslie Knope,You're insane.
Leslie Knope,Mark and I made love once.
Leslie Knope,And it was very intense.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, I'm looking for Leslie Knope."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,My ears are ringing.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm the deputy director of Parks and Recreation.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Shauna.
Leslie Knope,Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am familiar with your work."
Leslie Knope,I've read everything you've ever written.
Leslie Knope,You did an amazing in-depth article on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Who left the door open?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,And I agree with you.
Leslie Knope,They are nature's bandits.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Thanks.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I was happy with that line.
Leslie Knope,"So, can I give you a quick tour before we get started?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I've been here before.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A few times.
Leslie Knope,Quick tour?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.
Leslie Knope,"And this is called ""The trial of Chief Wamapo."""
Leslie Knope,It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.
Leslie Knope,I am always amazed at his quiet dignity right before he's killed by a cannonball.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm surprised no one's complained about this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, tons of people have."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we get letters every day."
Leslie Knope,"This is Ron Swanson, our boss."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is the reporter I was telling you about."
Ron Swanson,No comment.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,About what?
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Haverford, maybe one day you'll figure out how to spell a three letter word."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"I play a lot of online Scrabble with my boss, Ron Swanson, and, oh, my God, that guy is the best."
Tom Haverford,He beats me every time.
Tom Haverford,He kills me.
Tom Haverford,He's awesome.
Tom Haverford,I can't beat him.
Tom Haverford,I should just close my account.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Shauna, this is our crack team."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Tom Haverford, boy genius."
Leslie Knope,Smooth like milk chocolate.
Tom Haverford,That's a weird way to describe me.
Leslie Knope,"April Ludgate, 19."
Leslie Knope,Cool enough to be invited anywhere and chooses to be here.
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer."
Leslie Knope,They're the real heroes of this story.
Leslie Knope,Ann was the citizen who brought the pit to our attention.
Leslie Knope,And Andy is the citizen who fell in it.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"It's cool if I record this, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,That way it's verbatim.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Leslie, you're in charge of the committee."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"It's actually called a subcommittee, not a committee, so."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,We can do all this on tape.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sure we can.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"And this is where you meet, generally?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Really?
Leslie Knope,We meet at a bunch of different places.
Leslie Knope,We don't always meet here.
Leslie Knope,So I didn't quite know how to answer that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, why don't I ask the rest of your team some questions and then we will come back to you later?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Because these are the real heroes.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna be in my office.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, Andy, tell me about the night you fell into the pit."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,That's actually a great story.
Andy Dwyer,"I just finished up a gig with my band Three Skin, formerly Four Skin, but our bassist left for personal reasons."
Andy Dwyer,"And I was taking a shortcut home, and I thought I saw a toaster lying in the pit."
Andy Dwyer,"And I was like, ""Maybe I should get that."""
Andy Dwyer,And I fell in and broke my legs.
Leslie Knope,Such a tragedy.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why would you want a toaster that's lying at the bottom of the pit?
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,I was pretty wasted.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,You were drunk?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Totally.
Andy Dwyer,You knew that.
Ann Perkins,"I didn't know that, no."
Ann Perkins,"You should've told me, because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital."
Andy Dwyer,I was probably not thinking 'cause I had two broken femurs and I was blackout drunk.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I just I can't believe I'm just finding this out right now."
Andy Dwyer,Like you're perfect.
Andy Dwyer,You're on the pill.
Andy Dwyer,You drink all the time.
Ann Perkins,You're allowed to do that.
Leslie Knope,Stay on message.
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for bringing that up in front of a reporter.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's not that bad, right?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, why don't we just go back in there and talk about the park?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.
Leslie Knope,"The press are like sharks, and you guys just dumped a bucket of chum in the water."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, I just got your 15 texts."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope,I tried to stay on message.
Mark Brendanawicz,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me."
Leslie Knope,Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.
Leslie Knope,And it turns out that Ann is on birth control pills.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Shauna is in the conference room, and she's writing a really bad article and it's gonna destroy us all."
Leslie Knope,Please fix it.
Tom Haverford,"April, let me ask you something."
Tom Haverford,Do you think I'm in the top five best looking Indian guys in Pawnee?
April Ludgate,No.
Tom Haverford,Who do you think's got me beat?
Tom Haverford,That guy Hashish at City Planning?
Ron Swanson,Tommy boy.
Ron Swanson,"Let me tell you something, Tom."
Ron Swanson,You suck at Scrabble.
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,You're destroying me.
Ron Swanson,"You're worse than my exwife, and she's terrible at Scrabble."
Ron Swanson,And she's a bitch.
Tom Haverford,"Look out, man."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna get you one of these days.
Tom Haverford,I'm practicing.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I doubt that."
Ron Swanson,Her name is Tammy Swanson and she's a serious bitch.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, Leslie."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I have to go.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Let's do the interview tomorrow morning at the pit.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll have a photographer meet us there.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,See you then.
Leslie Knope,Disaster averted.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"That was easy, right?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Can we go in your car?
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,All right.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,'Cause I hate driving.
Leslie Knope,There's a beautiful view from over there.
Leslie Knope,This is a great place to take a shot.
Leslie Knope,"Over there as well, so I think you're fine."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no problem."
Leslie Knope,Do you live near Mark?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"No, not at all."
Leslie Knope,So he gave you a ride somehow?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"You know, do you have a pen?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Cause I don't--
Leslie Knope,"No, sorry."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Michael, do you have any paper I could borrow?"
Extra,"I might, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to complain, but I think Shauna is being a little unprofessional."
Leslie Knope,She got here 15 minutes late. She's wearing the same dress she wore yesterday.
Leslie Knope,And she had to get a ride from--
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So how big is this lot?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, how big is--"
Leslie Knope,What?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,How big is the lot?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The lot?
Leslie Knope,How big is what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,You tell me.
Leslie Knope,How big is the lot?
Leslie Knope,A hundred or something.
Leslie Knope,Give or take 100.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,A hundred what?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Shauna Malwae-Tweep."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't I guess I don't know anything.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,I have to get something from my car.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
April Ludgate,Kicking Ron's butt at Scrabble.
April Ludgate,"I just played ""lexicons"" for a billion points."
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no, no."
April Ludgate,What?
Tom Haverford,"I was letting him win, dumbass."
April Ludgate,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,"""Lateral, communal, zonal""?"
Tom Haverford,"You dropped a ""Z"" in there?"
Tom Haverford,April.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So when did you start at the Parks Department?
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was a few years ago."
Leslie Knope,My mother got me the job.
Leslie Knope,I was qualified.
Leslie Knope,It's not like it was nepotism.
Leslie Knope,Crap on a stick.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism."
Leslie Knope,"But-- Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"No, it wasn't."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sorry.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's not you.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just I'm exhausted.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I got, like, zero sleep last night."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So--
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You're home.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm home."
Leslie Knope,"I was doing an interview at the pit, and it was going really well."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, it was going perfect."
Leslie Knope,"But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Ann Perkins,So how'd it go?
Ann Perkins,"She didn't ask about Andy being drunk, did she?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, just your kind of standard questions."
Leslie Knope,There was one annoying thing.
Leslie Knope,She and Mark had sex with each other.
Ann Perkins,You're kidding.
Leslie Knope,"I wish I was, but I'm not."
Leslie Knope,They did it.
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep and Mark Brendanawicz had sex with each other last night.
Andy Dwyer,Who had sex?
Ann Perkins,That guy Mark and the reporter.
Andy Dwyer,Called it.
Andy Dwyer,I called that.
Andy Dwyer,You remember that?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"He did, actually."
Ann Perkins,He totally called that.
Leslie Knope,Why do men have to behave like this?
Leslie Knope,Why can't they be professionals?
Andy Dwyer,Men are dogs.
Ann Perkins,"You know, maybe they really like each other."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't like her.
Andy Dwyer,He was probably thinking with the head of his wiener instead of the head of his brain.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,God.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, come on."
Andy Dwyer,Men do that.
Andy Dwyer,It's disgusting.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should go talk to him."
Leslie Knope,Make sure that he didn't say anything to hurt the project.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Definitely, you should talk to him."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,I bet he didn't use a condom.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, God!"
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mark."
Leslie Knope,May I come into your office?
Leslie Knope,I need to speak with you about something very sensitive.
Leslie Knope,Something's come to my attention that requires your attention.
Leslie Knope,It has come to my attention that you had sex with Ms. Malwae-Tweep.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's personal.
Leslie Knope,It's unethical and it's irresponsible for a public servant to have sex with a member of the press corps.
Leslie Knope,Especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have sex with her and"
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm gonna say something.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't want you to take it the wrong way.
Mark Brendanawicz,But you're being a huge dork.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, then I resign from your subcommittee."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is deputy director of Parks and Recreation--"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Leslie?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hi."
Leslie Knope,I accidentally ate an old burrito.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Leslie Knope,I was acting strange at the pit and the reason is because I had food poisoning from an old burrito.
Leslie Knope,"So, I was hoping we could have a do over interview."
Leslie Knope,Maybe over lunch.
Leslie Knope,I'm buying.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, I guess I'm free."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm assuming not Mexican.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Because of the burrito.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it wasn't a Mexican burrito."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you sure that's the best thing for you right now?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the best thing on the menu."
Leslie Knope,"So, look, I feel like I may have gone a little off message at the pit."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, you seemed a little weird."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wouldn't say weird."
Leslie Knope,"It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made?
Leslie Knope,Can I say over 100%?
Leslie Knope,Because I would be lying if I said less.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Wow.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You seem a lot more confident than some of the other people I've spoken to.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Can I read you some of these quotes?
Leslie Knope,Be my guest.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""The Sullivan Street pit is always going to be a pit."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, until it turns into a park."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Hey, you should write an article on unicorns, because they're more likely to exist than this park."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Tell that to a 14 year old girl.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on the Pope getting married, because that's more likely to happen than this park."""
Leslie Knope,There are some countries where the Pope can be married.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article on talking monkeys."""
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Have you seen The Wizard of Oz?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article about leprechauns."""
Leslie Knope,Leprechauns exist.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""You should write an article about the sun falling out of the sky."""
Leslie Knope,Why would you write an article about that?
Leslie Knope,That's--
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"This one is just ""No."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""This park is never, ever, ever, ever going to happen."""
Leslie Knope,Might I ask who said that?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Mark Brendanawicz.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Can I talk to you for a second?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, what's up?"
Ann Perkins,You and I need to find a way to fix this reporter thing.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why is this a big deal to anybody?
Ann Perkins,"Well, apparently, the reporter is gonna print everything you said to her."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I didn't say anything to her.
Ann Perkins,"""The park is never, ever, ever, ever getting built?"""
Mark Brendanawicz,But that stuff was off the record.
Ann Perkins, Did you say it was off the record?
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you have to say it's off the record?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins, Hey.
Ann Perkins, Thank you so much for meeting us.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Sure.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," Hey, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz, Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz, Uh I heard that you were gonna print some of that stuff that I said in private about the park.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," Oh, yeah."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, My editor loves it.
Ann Perkins," You know, we'd really appreciate it if you didn't print that stuff 'cause we're trying to build this park--"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't understand.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," You did say it, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Technically.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Technically?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you know, you got up because you had to write the article and I said, ""Come on, stay in bed."""
Mark Brendanawicz," ""That park is never, ever, ever gonna get made."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Right.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, And then I came back to bed.
Mark Brendanawicz," Yeah, but the important part of what I said was, ""Stay in bed."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I would've said anything at that point if I thought it would make you stay in bed."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," Okay, well, since we're, you know, romantically involved, I won't print any of it."
Ann Perkins, That's great.
Ann Perkins, Thank you so much.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, You're welcome.
Mark Brendanawicz," You know, I wouldn't say romantically involved."
Mark Brendanawicz," You know, going forward."
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz, What?
Tom Haverford,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson, Tom.
Tom Haverford," Ron, I don't know what to tell you, man."
Tom Haverford, April got on my computer.
Tom Haverford, Password was saved.
Tom Haverford, She played a couple of Scrabble words.
Tom Haverford, It wasn't me.
Tom Haverford, I don't even know what lexicons are.
Tom Haverford, I thought that was a luxury automobile.
Tom Haverford, You're the word king.
Tom Haverford, She was probably cheating.
Ron Swanson, I knew that couldn't have been you.
Ron Swanson, You don't have the vocabulary.
Tom Haverford, I know.
Ron Swanson, You can't even spell vocabulary.
Tom Haverford, Yeah.
Tom Haverford, V-O-G-X Was that right? No.
Ron Swanson, We're cool.
Ron Swanson, I'm not an idiot.
Ron Swanson, I know Tom has been losing to me on purpose.
Ron Swanson, But I like Tom.
Ron Swanson, He doesn't do a lot of work around here.
Ron Swanson, He shows zero initiative.
Ron Swanson, He's not a team player.
Ron Swanson, He's never one to go that extra mile.
Ron Swanson, Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government employee.
Mark Brendanawicz," Hey, you busy?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics for the Pawnee Journal, so, yeah, I'm a little busy."
Mark Brendanawicz, I wanted to apologize to you.
Leslie Knope, Really?
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz, I never should've done anything with that reporter.
Tom Haverford, Whoa! You nailed Malwae-Tweep? Nice.
Mark Brendanawicz," Yes, but I'm not gonna do it again."
Leslie Knope, It's over.
Tom Haverford, So she's available.
Mark Brendanawicz, I really did think that that stuff that I said was off the record.
Mark Brendanawicz," But you were right, and I should've listened to you."
Mark Brendanawicz, I tried to get her to pull some of those quotes and things got a little dicey.
Leslie Knope," Well, I appreciate you trying."
Leslie Knope, Would you like to be reinstated onto our subcommittee?
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope, You'll have my answer within the month.
Leslie Knope," Mark, can I ask you a question? You didn't really believe it when you said that the park was never gonna get made, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Park's gonna get done.
Leslie Knope," Welcome back, subcommittee member Mark Brendanawicz."
Mark Brendanawicz, Thanks.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz," Thanks, a lot."
Leslie Knope, Thank you a lot.
Tom Haverford," Man, that dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the article came out, and it was a mixed bag."
Leslie Knope," ""An abandoned lot on Sullivan Street has been proposed as the site of a new park."""
Leslie Knope,That part's good.
Leslie Knope, I think we stayed on message for that part.
Leslie Knope, And then it gets a little unpleasant.
Leslie Knope," ""Pretty drunk, Ann's on the pill."""
Leslie Knope,"I didn't ""throw up,"" I spit up."
Leslie Knope, JJ's Diner gets a nice mention.
Leslie Knope," Oh, and right here."
Leslie Knope, At the end.
Leslie Knope," She writes, and I quote, ""We'll see."""
Leslie Knope,Ends on a hopeful note.

Leslie Knope,I don't believe it.

Leslie Knope,It's real.

Leslie Knope,"But you cannot enjoy this basket, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope,"And so to avoid temptation, I am gonna lock it up."

Tom Haverford,"""You are so pure, you're like a brown Superman with a beard that just stands for justice and truth and the American way."""
Leslie Knope,"So, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I asked April to create one of those social network Internet profiles for the Sullivan Street pit.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready for the debut?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, can we cut that red ribbon around your monitor now?"
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,I love a good ribbon cutting.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"April, that's good."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Kids.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, look, the pit already has six friends."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Leslie Knope,Mark's a friend.
Tom Haverford,"Well, you guys gotta see Mark's profile."
Tom Haverford,Look at the photos of these ladies on his page.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,Sick.
Leslie Knope,Maybe those are his relatives.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, maybe fake boobs run in his family."
Tom Haverford,Look at this lady.
Tom Haverford,She's got a thong on her face.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, his favorite movie is Dances With Wolves."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we're good."
Leslie Knope,We'll keep checking in on this.
Ann Perkins,"Where is Mark, anyway?"
Leslie Knope,Attending yet another meeting of the old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,"Politics is full of boys' clubs, formal and informal."
Leslie Knope,Behind me are all the members of the city council over the past 30 years.
Leslie Knope,"And every day, as a woman, I have to walk past this wall of men."
Leslie Knope,It can be very upsetting.
Leslie Knope,Especially because of that guy.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,See?
Ann Perkins,What are they doing out there?
Leslie Knope,Wheeling and dealing.
Leslie Knope,Divvying up the empire.
Extra,"Oh, my wife got me this shirt."
Extra,She swears it makes me look thinner.
Mark Brendanawicz,It kind of does.
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,Let's go out there.
Leslie Knope,Let's bust up that old boys' club.
Leslie Knope,We're doing great work in the government.
Leslie Knope,We deserve to be included.
Ann Perkins,"Sure, yeah."
Ann Perkins,I could use a beer.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"That's good, think like a man."
Leslie Knope,"April, we're leaving, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,And it's because you're a woman!
Extra,"What, do you really like red tape and uphill battles?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Leslie!"
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Mark Brendanawicz,What is up?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's up.
Leslie Knope,A couple of ladies are coming to bust up your little boys' club.
Mark Brendanawicz,Awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz,Glad to have you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Let me get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,We're in.
Brian,"Hey, I'm Brian."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Brian, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Deputy director of--
Mark Brendanawicz,Drink that.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"I'm Ann, everyone."
Ann Perkins,I don't work here.
Extra,"Hey, Ann."
Extra,Steve.
Leslie Knope,"So, what are you guys talking about?"
Leslie Knope,What's the topic du jour?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that?
Leslie Knope,That was the sound of a glass ceiling being shattered.
Leslie Knope,"The boys' club is more about socializing than work, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you gotta loosen up."
Leslie Knope,I kind of feel like I'm already in the boys' club.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at those bitches clean up after me."
Ann Perkins,"So, is this, like, your regular Tuesday night scene?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, it's just a way to unwind, you know."
Ann Perkins,Mmmhmm.
Ann Perkins,"Really different from your Friday night crowd, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,What crowd?
Ann Perkins,"You know, the girls with the tribal back tattoos who drink Red Bull for a living."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like this."
Leslie Knope,This is banter.
Ann Perkins,That crowd.
Leslie Knope,Banter's fun.
Mark Brendanawicz,Where'd that come from?
Ann Perkins,"We were just on the computer, looking at your profile."
Ann Perkins,"You know, you have a friend who has a tattoo that says, ""Daddy's Girl."""
Ann Perkins,And both words are misspelled.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Mixing it up with the boys!
Leslie Knope,So What are you gonna say?
Leslie Knope,What's your comeback?
Mark Brendanawicz,Those aren't really my friends anymore.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't hang out with them.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boo."
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, that's some weak sauce."
Leslie Knope,You need to hit harder!
April Ludgate,"Natalie, it's your sister."
April Ludgate,Pick me up or I'm gonna draw all over your jeans.
Extra,"Well, it's official, people."
Extra,We're out of beer.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's the cue.
Mark Brendanawicz,"See you later, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,"It was nice hanging out, you know, after work hours."
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Ann Perkins,"I think I'm gonna take off, too."
Extra,"Yeah, I should go, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, you guys!"
Leslie Knope,Let's keep this good feeling going.
Leslie Knope,It's just getting started!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah, 'cause parties usually get started when you run out of booze."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,Just hold on a second.
Leslie Knope,I got wine!
All,Hey!
Leslie Knope,And cheese!
All,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"Last night, in a foolish attempt to infiltrate a boys' club, I violated the government employee ethics code of the state of Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"I have always tried to live my life in an ethical way, and last night, I failed."
Leslie Knope,"I realize I have let down every female public official in America, and I would like to apologize to them, right now, individually, and in alphabetical order."
Leslie Knope,"Michele Bachmann, Republican, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope,I am sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy Baldwin, Democrat, Wisconsin."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Melissa Bean.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Double shift, remember?"
Ann Perkins,So I won't see you till tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,Are you gonna be okay?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,I got dinner.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"Honey, can you just clean up a little bit?"
Andy Dwyer,I'll try.
Andy Dwyer,Don't expect much.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'll do it when I get home.
Andy Dwyer,You will?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,"She takes care of me, she takes care of sick people, sick babies."
Andy Dwyer,She is an angel.
Andy Dwyer,And I seriously love her.
Andy Dwyer,Hard.
Andy Dwyer,She's going to be gone for the next 24 hours so I made this list and basically this place is gonna be like a sparkling palace when she returns.
Andy Dwyer,I took a bunch of painkillers.
Andy Dwyer,They're about to kick in so I'm ready to go.
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Let's clear the air.
Leslie Knope,"Last night, I opened up this gift basket, for my own pleasure."
Tom Haverford,Really.
Tom Haverford,Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford,Usually such a prudish stickler for the rules.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not happy about it either, Tom."
Tom Haverford,It's like I don't even know you anymore.
Jerry Gergich,Last year you wrote me up for making personal phone calls to my mom.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,And I would do it again.
Leslie Knope,Two wrongs do not make a right.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, but she was in the hospital."
Leslie Knope,I did not know that at the time.
Donna Meagle,"So, can I have the basket?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,It's evidence.
Donna Meagle,It's a nice basket.
Jerry Gergich,What would you put in there?
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,Potpourri?
Tom Haverford,That's a lot of potpourri.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I am not the one on trial here."
Leslie Knope,I appreciate and thank you in advance for your unwavering support.
Tom Haverford,I think you should go to jail.
Tom Haverford,Think about what you've done.
Ron Swanson,Go to jail?
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have a very important and very long story to tell you."
Ron Swanson,Put it in an email?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,"It happened right out there, right outside this window."
Leslie Knope,Why can't I look away?
Ron Swanson,Let's not blow this out of proportion.
Leslie Knope,I will blow this in proportion!
Leslie Knope,The minimum punishment for this is an official reprimand from the city manager.
Ron Swanson,It's not that big a deal.
Leslie Knope,Maybe in your world it isn't a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"You're a white Protestant man with a full, rich mustache."
Leslie Knope,But I am a woman and I need to hold myself up to a higher standard.
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,You're punishing yourself more than anybody else is gonna punish you.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What do you suggest we do?
Leslie Knope,You think we should cover this up?
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm not saying that."
Ron Swanson,No one said cover up.
Leslie Knope,"Good, because the coverup is worse than the crime."
Leslie Knope,"When you spill something and you try to wipe it up with something that's dirty, then you get double dirty."
Ron Swanson,Please don't make this worse.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Good afternoon.
Leslie Knope,"Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps to make further amends for the mistakes that I have made."
Leslie Knope,"I have written a full confession, which I will be emailing to everyone in the entire Pawnee government."
Leslie Knope,"I've also attached a link to the pit's web page, just to remind people of all the good work that I do."
Leslie Knope,"I asked Ron to blow the whistle on me, and he refused."
Leslie Knope,And that is why I had to whistle blow myself.
Andy Dwyer,"I wish I could say some of this mess was Ann's, but it's all mine."
Andy Dwyer,I'm kind of a nester.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,Not bad for a guy with two broken legs.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Extra,Hey.
April Ludgate,I'm doing a little experiment tonight to see what will get me drunker.
April Ludgate,Drinking wine--
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Come here.
Tom Haverford,See what April put on the pit's web page.
April Ludgate,"Right now, drinking wine is winning--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What am I looking at?
April Ludgate,A video of me drinking some of that wine you stole.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why did you do this?
April Ludgate,"Because I was waiting for my sister and I was bored, and my hair looked really good."
Leslie Knope,And you put it in the pit's web page?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take this off."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I just sent an email to everyone in the government, and I put a link to this page!"
Tom Haverford,A young lawbreaker.
Tom Haverford,A future Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford,"Play it again for us, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,You got it.
Ron Swanson,Leslie?
Ron Swanson,She's 19 years old.
Ron Swanson,I thought I told you not to make this worse.
Leslie Knope,And I heard you loud and clear.
Ron Swanson,But then you made it worse.
Ron Swanson,"The disciplinary committee is having a hearing tomorrow, and you're gonna have to testify."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,April might get dismissed.
Ron Swanson,You could get fired.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,This bench is so uncomfortable.
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Help.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me it's gonna be okay."
Leslie Knope,Tell me it's gonna be okay.
Ron Swanson,It's gonna…
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Ron Swanson,It's It'II Hang in.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,You're okay.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,"I've spoken to you a couple of times about something that happened, but I don't want to-- I don't want to talk about it anymore."
Tom Haverford,"So, the disciplinary committee awaits."
Tom Haverford,Feeling good?
Tom Haverford,Feeling strong?
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Do you want me to run some test questions with you?
Tom Haverford,Maybe give you an idea of what the disciplinary committee will be like?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that'd be great."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, Miss Knope, you're accused of stealing wine."
Tom Haverford,"How many drinks do you have per week, on average?"
Leslie Knope,Zero.
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna write down 10.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Do you ever cheat on your taxes?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,Never.
Tom Haverford,Good.
Tom Haverford,You're doing great.
Tom Haverford,How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?
Leslie Knope,Are they gonna ask that?
Tom Haverford,"This is a deposition style hearing, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,Nothing is off limits.
Tom Haverford,You have to answer.
Tom Haverford,"Now, how many sexual partners have you had in the last year?"
Leslie Knope,Zero to six.
Tom Haverford,Zero.
Tom Haverford,Have you ever thought about Ron sexually?
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,Including dreams.
Tom Haverford,"Have you ever had a sexual dream about our boss, Ron Swanson?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,"Now, in this recurring dream that you have about Ron, is he like a regular Ron, or is he half Ron, half animal, like a centaur?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,No Is he wearing a football uniform?
Tom Haverford,Are you making love to him on a couch shaped like his mustache?
Tom Haverford,Is he covered in Powerade?
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Leslie Knope,Timeout.
Tom Haverford,"This committee doesn't take timeouts, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,Now answer the question!
Leslie Knope,I need something to drink.
Tom Haverford,How about some stolen wine?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I meant water.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you for your time, Miss Knope."
Tom Haverford,You're fired.
Tom Haverford,"So, that's kind of your worst case scenario, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"If you can handle that, I think you'll be fine."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for being here with me today."
Ron Swanson,I'm your department head.
Ron Swanson,I have to be.
Leslie Knope,Nonetheless.
Extra,Ms. Knope?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Extra,You're here because you allegedly accepted a gift of over 25 dollars and contributed to the delinquency of a minor.
Extra,Can you tell us what happened?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna take a glass of water first, if I may."
Extra,Certainly.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"""Two days ago, I attended an informal boys' club meeting for the very first time."""
Leslie Knope,"""After one and a half beers, awash in the glow of acceptance into this elite, exclusive club"""
Extra,"Sorry, what club is this?"
Ron Swanson,A couple city planners like to drink beer in the courtyard on Tuesday nights.
Extra,No one is supposed to drink alcohol on government property.
Ron Swanson,That's not my department.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead, Leslie."
,"""I made a very unwise decision."""
Leslie Knope," ""A decision that will live in infamy."""
Leslie Knope," ""I opened a gift basket of wine and cheese."""
Leslie Knope," ""Our intern, April Ludgate, drank some of that wine without my knowledge."""
Leslie Knope," ""That was never part of the plan."""
Leslie Knope," ""She had not been invited to the meeting of the boys' club."""
Leslie Knope," ""I repeat, not been invited."""
Leslie Knope," ""Though it is my hope that someday, she lives in a world where the very idea of boys' clubs is ancient history."""
Extra,But you did open the gift basket.
Extra, And the intern did drink the wine.
Leslie Knope, Please don't blame her for my mistake.
Leslie Knope, The biggest crime we could commit here would be to destroy a teenage girl's passion for local government.
Andy Dwyer," There's only one more thing I need to clean, me."
Andy Dwyer," Um, I can't really get into a shower, so I got this idea from my parents."
Andy Dwyer, This is how they clean their dog.
Andy Dwyer, Do you like that? Huh? I wrote that for Ann.
Andy Dwyer, It's gonna be playing when she walks through the door today.
Andy Dwyer, And check this out.
Andy Dwyer, Washed my shorts.
Andy Dwyer, How do you like that?
Lawrence,Hey.
Lawrence, Turn that down.
Andy Dwyer, No.
Andy Dwyer, I wrote that song.
Lawrence, I don't care.
Lawrence, Turn it down.
Andy Dwyer," What are you doing in my yard, Lawrence? Get out of here."
Lawrence," Okay, you know what? I'm taking this."
Andy Dwyer, Put down my boom box.
Lawrence, It's my boom box now.
Lawrence, I asked you nicely.
Andy Dwyer," You did not ask me nicely! Put that down! I just put 12 new batteries in that thing! Lawrence, come on!"
Extra,What's going on out here?
Andy Dwyer,Give it to me! Come on.
Andy Dwyer," Go back inside, Hank."
Extra," Miss Knope, what was the first thing you did when you arrived at work the next day? Can you go over the time line for us once more?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course."
Leslie Knope, I awoke at 6:21 a.m. after a fitful night of sleep.
Ron Swanson,We've been over this.
Ron Swanson, What more could you guys possibly want her to do?
Extra,"Well, we don't know yet."
Extra, Frankly we've got a lot more questions.
Leslie Knope," Ron, it's okay."
Ron Swanson," No, it's not."
Ron Swanson, This is not communist China.
Ron Swanson, You cannot make her whip herself.
Ron Swanson, You cannot make her wear a hair shirt.
Extra, We weren't planning on doing either of those things.
Ron Swanson, This is America.
Ron Swanson," You want to live in North Korea, you can live in North Korea."
Ron Swanson, I don't want to.
Ron Swanson, I want to live in America.
Ron Swanson," Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying."
Ron Swanson," If you want to slap her on the wrist, go ahead."
Ron Swanson," If you want to do anything more serious, you're gonna have to go through me."
Ron Swanson, Let's go.
Leslie Knope, Are we done?
Ron Swanson,"We're done, let's go."
Ron Swanson," So, after all that, it's really not that bad."
Ron Swanson, You're gonna get a letter in your file.
Leslie Knope," Ron, I just wanted to say thank you, so--"
Ron Swanson,Don't worry about it.
Ron Swanson," No, I didn't do it for Leslie."
Ron Swanson, I did it because I hate bureaucracy.
Ron Swanson," My idea of a perfect government is one guy, who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke."
Ron Swanson," The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon."
Ron Swanson," And women are brought to him, maybe, when he desires them."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope, You're here.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I came from the hospital."
Ann Perkins, How'd it go?
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to be overdramatic, but today felt like 100 years in hell and the absolute worst day of my life."
Ann Perkins," Oh, God."
Leslie Knope, I never should have opened that stupid basket.
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, Why did you open that basket? It doesn't really seem like you.
Leslie Knope, I think it's 'cause I wanted to shatter the glass ceiling.
Leslie Knope, You know what I mean? And just kind of infiltrate the boys' club.
Ann Perkins, Hmm.
Leslie Knope, I did it for a guy.
Ann Perkins, Oh!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Mark.
Ann Perkins, Oh.
Ann Perkins, Oh.
Ann Perkins, Wow.
Leslie Knope,We had a brief affair in February of 2004.
Leslie Knope," And there's still something very complicated between us, so…"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins, Sure.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, Smart woman.
Ann Perkins, Iffy choice in men.
Ann Perkins," But then again, I'm not one to talk."
Andy Dwyer, What do you think?
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins, This is so sweet.
Andy Dwyer, It's nothing.
Ann Perkins, What happened to you?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I was chasing our neighbor who's a total jagweed and I fell in some prickly bushes."
Andy Dwyer, Doesn't matter.
Andy Dwyer," What do you think of the house, huh? Were you totally surprised?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, Do you love it?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins," Here, baby."
Ann Perkins, Sit down.
Ann Perkins, I'm gonna put something on those scratches.
Andy Dwyer, Somebody is getting gently laid tonight.
Ann Perkins, Andy! God!
Mark Brendanawicz,You look like you need one of these.
Mark Brendanawicz, Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz, You're over 21.
Leslie Knope, You're not supposed to be drinking on government property.
Mark Brendanawicz, Loosen up.
Mark Brendanawicz, You're gonna drive yourself crazy trying to follow every single rule in government.
Leslie Knope," Mark, I have a letter in my file."
Mark Brendanawicz, I got seven letters in my file.
Mark Brendanawicz, Pretty much every guy in city planning has a bunch of letters.
Mark Brendanawicz," So, welcome to the team."
Leslie Knope," Look out, boys."
Leslie Knope, I'm in your club now.
Leslie Knope, I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope, I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope, I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope, I'm in your club.
Leslie Knope, I'm in your Mmm.
Leslie Knope, Creepy.

,Season: 1 Episode: 05
Leslie Knope,"In a town as old as Pawnee, there's a lot of history in every acre."
Leslie Knope,"This wooded area is the site of, um, the murder, actually, of Nathaniel Bixby Mark."
Leslie Knope,"He was a pioneer who was killed by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians, after he traded them a baby for what is now Indianapolis."
Leslie Knope,They cut his face off.
Leslie Knope,And they made it into a dream catcher.
Leslie Knope,And they made his legs into rain sticks.
Leslie Knope,"And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer."
Leslie Knope,Today is a great day for the Knope family.
Leslie Knope,My mother is being honored at a banquet with the Tellenson Award for Excellence in Pawnee Public Service.
Leslie Knope,"The award's named after the legendary Tony Tellenson, who was a great man."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, is a great man."
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am glad that they're keeping him alive."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I saw you survive that town hall meeting.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You keep that up and you're gonna be figuring out what wall to put your own Tellenson Award on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I already know, the one on the left where the American flag is."
Leslie Knope,"But I think we could be a multigenerational political dynasty, you and I, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Like the Kennedys, or the Bushes."
Leslie Knope,Minus the drinking problem.
Leslie Knope,I mean no disrespect.
Ron Swanson,The only reason anybody's going to this thing is because they're afraid of what Marlene'll do to them if they don't.
Ron Swanson,That woman is tough.
Ron Swanson,"In 1994, I gave her a nickname."
Ron Swanson,"It's unrepeatable, but it stuck."
Ron Swanson,It's my proudest accomplishment.
Ron Swanson,"It's ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,This is a big night.
Leslie Knope,"We are gonna meet some powerful people tonight, so take this down."
Tom Haverford,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mother.
Leslie Knope,How important are speeches?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, ask the Gettysburg Address."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it didn't answer your call?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was in the Smithsonian.
Leslie Knope,It was a great learning experience because my mom casts a long shadow.
Leslie Knope,Read that part back to me.
Tom Haverford,"""I was learning disabled and my mom cast a very long shadow."""
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't say ""learning disabled."""
Tom Haverford,"Um, we'll just move on."
Tom Haverford,We can fix that later.
Tom Haverford,"Long shadow, go."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I've lost my momentum now."
Leslie Knope,"Um, all right, let's start from the top."
Leslie Knope,What's the first sentence again?
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope is morbidly obese."""
Leslie Knope,"I never said ""obese."""
Leslie Knope,"I said ""is my mother."""
Tom Haverford,"Oh, sorry."
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Leslie Knope,"I need to mention the park and in a very subtle way, I need to let people know that I'm forging my own path and I have my own subcommittee."
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to sound braggy.
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Tom Haverford,"It's about appearing humble, you know?"
Tom Haverford,"Abraham Lincoln, when he started his speeches, he would come up and say, ""My name's Abraham Lincoln."""
Tom Haverford,"""I'm the President of the United States."""
Tom Haverford,"""But I'm gonna be honest with you."""
Tom Haverford,"""I have no clue what I'm doing."""
Tom Haverford,"So, maybe you start off with something like that."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, I start off with, ""I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am the Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing."""
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Then, I think what we want to do at that point is start getting the energy up."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,How about this?
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope is definitely not a whore."""
Leslie Knope,No.
etom,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope has not five but seven Asian friends."""
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope has never solicited a male prostitute."""
Tom Haverford,"""Marlene Griggs-Knope has said the N word only four times in her entire life."""
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Tom Haverford,She said it more than that?
Ann Perkins,How about this one?
Andy Dwyer,That is hot.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,That is really hot.
Andy Dwyer,How come you don't dress up like that for me?
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I would feel a little silly putting on a nice dress to go to ""the couch."""
Ann Perkins,I haven't been out in so long.
Ann Perkins,Andy being in a cast has definitely put a crimp in our social life.
Ann Perkins,"I don't really know Leslie's mom, and I don't know what the Tellenson Award is, but at this moment in my life, it sounds like a magical evening."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I'm out of milk."
Ann Perkins,"How dressy is this, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,To the max.
Leslie Knope,It is the most exclusive local government event of the year.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,The Tellensons is like the Oscars times the Grammys plus the Super Bowl.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Um, I should probably change."
Leslie Knope,I'm headed to the salon right now.
Leslie Knope,Salvatore Manfrelotti has been cutting hair across from Pioneer Hall since 1958.
Leslie Knope,All the movers and shakers who come through Pawnee have sat in that chair at one point or another.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's the guy that made Larry Bird look the way he does."
Salvatore,Next.
Leslie Knope,"So, what's the inside scoop, Salvatore?"
Salvatore,My feet hurt.
Leslie Knope,Classic Salvatore!
Salvatore,Do I know you?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, no."
Leslie Knope,This is my first official political haircut.
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation."
Salvatore,Are you related to that Marlene Something Knope?
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,Would you call being her daughter related?
Salvatore,What the hell else would you call it?
Salvatore,"Now, what do you want me to do with this?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, my mom is being honored tonight."
Leslie Knope,"So, in a way, I am also being honored."
Leslie Knope,"And I just wanted to mix things up a little bit, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Pin it up, something sassy, but powerful and dynastic."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
April Ludgate,"Good evening, sir."
Leslie Knope,"I'm off the clock, April."
Leslie Knope,You don't need to call me sir.
Leslie Knope,"Salvatore calls this hairdo ""The Mayor."""
Leslie Knope,"And yes, I will wear my hair like this when I am the first female mayor of Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, man, I am way overdressed."
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You look great.
Leslie Knope,We look great.
Leslie Knope,Everyone's looking at us.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,You want a drink?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, I do very much want a drink."
Ann Perkins,That man is staring.
Leslie Knope,That's former City Councilman Frank Schnable.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we are in rarified air tonight, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Rarified air!
Ann Perkins,He's coming over.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Be cool, be cool!"
Ann Perkins,I will try.
Frank Schnable,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former City Councilman."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I am the daughter of the honoree this evening.
Frank Schnable,I just wanted to tell you that I think that what you two are doing is so brave.
Frank Schnable,Just being who you are.
Frank Schnable,I wish I had your courage.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go."
Ron Swanson,I enjoy government functions like I enjoy getting kicked in the nuggets with a steeltoe boot.
Ron Swanson,But this hotel always serves bacon wrapped shrimp.
Ron Swanson,That's my number one favorite food wrapped around my number three favorite food.
Ron Swanson,"I'd go to a banquet and honor of those Somali pirates, if they served bacon wrapped shrimp."
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Table 12."
Leslie Knope,"Can I get a ""what what?"""
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, Ann, you look stunning, but, Leslie, wow."
Leslie Knope,I was going for wow.
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Ann Perkins,I was told it was black tie.
Ron Swanson,"I like your hairdo, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,It's just like my brother's.
Ron Swanson,He's an officer in the Air Force.
Ron Swanson,Bacon wrapped shrimp.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, I'm okay."
Ron Swanson,I wasn't offering.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, don't look."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I said don't look."
Leslie Knope,Seated behind us is Janine Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,We need to rezone the pit to turn it into a park and she's on the zoning board.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what a night!"
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,This is so cool.
Leslie Knope,At that table are all eight living Tellenson Award winners.
Leslie Knope,"Bert Winfield, Geoffrey Morglesberg, Quentin Arble, Dawn Krink, Michael Holloway, I don't know who that is, that's somebody's wife, Horace Rangel, Wilmer Vism and Oscar Pfortmiller."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Oscar Pfortmiller is dead.
Leslie Knope,"That's his disappointing son, Theo."
Leslie Knope,Another dynasty.
Leslie Knope,What a testament to my mother.
Leslie Knope,"If a bomb went off in here, it would definitely make the Indianapolis papers."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to get me to talk to Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,She's right behind us and she could rezone our park.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, then just go up there and say hello and start talking to her."
Leslie Knope,"Brilliant political strategy, Mark."
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should mention her massive weight loss.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're overthinking this.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Here, I'm gonna pretend to be Janine Restrepo."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You, be you."
Mark Brendanawicz,Go.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Madame Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope from the Parks-- What are you doing?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I can do whatever I want.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Please, tell me about this park that you badly need rezoned by me."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multi-use community park."
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you?
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Wait, what's that?"
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I'm just former City Councilman Frank Whatever The Hell.
Ann Perkins,"And I have more power than Janine Restrepo, so I can do whatever I want."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know if that's true or not.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm Marlene Griggs-Knope and I will destroy you all!"
Tom Haverford,What the hell are you guys doing?
Mark Brendanawicz,It's fun to pretend to be zoning board members.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hey My goodness.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Look at you.
Leslie Knope,You like?
Leslie Knope,I went to Salvatore.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Salvatore usually does men.
Leslie Knope,Usually.
Leslie Knope,But this time he made an exception.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann Perkins.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, right, Leslie's new friend."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, friend."
Ann Perkins,She's We're friends.
Ann Perkins,Just friends.
Ann Perkins,I have a boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,He's a man.
Leslie Knope,"So, I need your advice."
Leslie Knope,I'm seated near Janine Restrepo.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The queen of the zoning board?
Ann Perkins,Am I the only [bleep] Person here who doesn't know Janine Restrepo?
Leslie Knope,I think she could be very useful.
Leslie Knope,What's my in?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, let's see."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You wrote a speech?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"It's 22 minutes long, with the song."
Leslie Knope,I could cut the song.
Leslie Knope,The song's cut.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Scrap the whole thing.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Let's make the speech work for us.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, politics!"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,My mom is crazy good at this.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Okay, the two things you have going for you is your connection with me, of course, and the fact that Restrepo loves feeling important."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So make sure that you butter her up.
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,I'll make her feel like a human dinner roll.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, Marlene's daughter."
Leslie Knope,"Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom, but she's so much more than that."
Leslie Knope,She's also my mother.
Leslie Knope,"And together, we are the Knopes."
Leslie Knope,"And if you weren't thinking it, you probably already said it, ""political dynasty."""
Leslie Knope,Please save your applause until the end.
Leslie Knope,There are so many luminaries here tonight.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the list includes such amazing people as zoning board member Janine Restrepo, and others."
Leslie Knope,"In conclusion, my mom is Marlene Griggs-Knope."
Leslie Knope,And I am just so psyched that Janine Restrepo is here.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, Mom."
Leslie Knope,"And you, too, Janine."
Tom Haverford,"You're the man, Leslie!"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I wish I could talk.
Leslie Knope,Moving and shaking.
Ann Perkins,This is my evening.
Ann Perkins,I'm Leslie's trophy wife.
Extra,I'd like to invite anyone who has a few words to say to Marlene to come up during dinner.
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Pawnee government!"
Tom Haverford,My name is Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"And if five years ago, you told me I was gonna be in this ballroom with Marlene Griggs-Knope, I would've guessed we were getting married."
Leslie Knope,Janine?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Janine Restrepo,Hi.
Janine Restrepo,Have we ever met?
Leslie Knope,"No, but I am a big fan."
Leslie Knope,I'm Marlene's daughter.
Janine Restrepo,"Yeah, I got that."
Leslie Knope,"Right, and I would love to speak to you about the ways we can improve our city."
Janine Restrepo,"Okay, well, call my secretary, and maybe we can set something up for next month."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Janine Restrepo,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Janine Restrepo,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Next month, then."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Janine Restrepo,Uh-huh.
Janine Restrepo,Bye.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I can't leave now."
Ann Perkins,I'll get one for you on the way home.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, meatball and ham."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, is that two different subs?"
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,I don't know if they can do that.
Tom Haverford,Come on!
Tom Haverford,I'm serious!
Tom Haverford,"Now, the words ""too sexy"" aren't really in my vocabulary, but, Marlene, girl, you are too sexy!"
Ron Swanson,"I refuse to lather Marlene up, kiss her ring like everybody else."
Ron Swanson,Instead I'll be delivering a speech of facts.
Ron Swanson,Marlene is a woman.
Ron Swanson,She has worked in the government for three decades.
Ron Swanson,Thirty years.
Ron Swanson,"Properly applied, that's how long a good varnish should last."
Ron Swanson,"So, Marlene, it is true that you have won this award."
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz.
Tom Haverford,Let's bounce.
Tom Haverford,We're gonna be late.
Mark Brendanawicz,For what?
Tom Haverford,Ladies.
Tom Haverford,Scully's Bar.
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,"Bounce, bounce, bounce."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Please, you guys are the only people here I know."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, well, this thing's kind of wrapping up."
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe we could leave a little later.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, it's 9:30, on a Friday night in Pawnee."
Tom Haverford,"There's not gonna be a later, Mark."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, now, you promised we'd go hit on chicks."
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe you and Leslie can join us at the bar.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I would love to come hit on chicks with you guys, but she seems kind of engaged in something and I think I should probably stay."
Tom Haverford,You'd hit on chicks?
Tom Haverford,For real?
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, you know what?"
Mark Brendanawicz,We're gonna be at Scully's if you two can tear yourselves away.
Tom Haverford,"Let's do this, Mark."
Leslie Knope,It went really well with Restrepo.
Leslie Knope,She said I should call her and we can set something up next month.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Did she say call her or call her secretary?
Leslie Knope,Secretary.
Leslie Knope,"That's good, right?"
Leslie Knope,Secretary makes her schedule.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"That's great, honey."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,She's blowing us off.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Really?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, she's totally blowing us off."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That is not conduct worthy of the zoning board.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,She's a little weasel.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Okay, I didn't want to have to use this, but her husband got a DUl in Illinois last week."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And she's trying to keep it quiet.
Leslie Knope,"Well, everyone has their problems."
Leslie Knope,"So, what should my next tactic be?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"The DUl, Leslie."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Let her know you know all about it, connect it to what you want, and then tell her if she doesn't help you, and soon, you're gonna tell everybody in town."
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could do that.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I want to win a Tellenson Award some day."
Leslie Knope,They don't give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, they only give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Those are eight of the nastiest, most diabolical people you could ever want to meet."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Bert Winfield was a blackmailer.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And Dawn Krink slept her way to the top of the DMV.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Trip Holloway named names in the '50s.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Horace Rangel used the police department to harass journalists.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And Jesus, honey."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Tony Tellenson was the worst.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He tried to resegregate the drinking fountains.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, where's Mark?"
Ann Perkins,He left with Tom.
Leslie Knope,Shoot!
Leslie Knope,"I have a tough assignment, and I need his help with it."
Ann Perkins,I could help.
Ann Perkins,Give me something to do.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.
Leslie Knope,She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroom vroom vroom vroom and glug glug glug glug glug.
Ann Perkins,So you're gonna blackmail her?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellenson style."
Ann Perkins,"That doesn't sound tough to me, that sounds slimy."
Ann Perkins,It sounds like your mom's telling you to be slimy.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you don't understand politics."
Leslie Knope,"Look, nursing is easy."
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them."
Leslie Knope,"But politics is different, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Sometimes you have to bring the pain.
Leslie Knope,You can't let yourself get taken advantage of.
Ann Perkins,I think your mom's giving you bad advice.
Leslie Knope,I don't think so.
Ann Perkins,You just do everything your mom tells you to do?
Leslie Knope,You just do everything your boyfriend tells you to do?
Leslie Knope,Make any pancakes lately?
Ann Perkins,He has two broken legs.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and he's got three crutches."
Leslie Knope,And one of them is you!
Leslie Knope,And the other two are crutches.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I don't need to be here."
Frank Schnable,It's okay.
Frank Schnable,You're allowed to fight.
Frank Schnable,You two are just like everyone else.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, former Councilman Schnable."
Extra,"And now, a very special message from Mr. Anthony Tellenson himself, recorded earlier this year from his hospital bed, before he lost the power of speech."
Ann Perkins,"I'm leaving now, honey."
Ann Perkins,"Cool Ranch, got it."
Ann Perkins,Anything else?
Ann Perkins,Mmm I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get those tonight.
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I don't think I can find a store that's open that sells slippers."
Tom Haverford,I've been dying to go out with Mark.
Tom Haverford,Always thought we'd make a great team.
Tom Haverford,You know?
Tom Haverford," He's handsome, I'm a cutie pie."
Tom Haverford, He's laid back.
Tom Haverford," I'm more in your face, but in a fun way."
Tom Haverford, Ladies don't stand a chance.
Mark Brendanawicz, Uh What's with the hat?
Tom Haverford,It's called peacocking.
Tom Haverford," Basically, I'm wearing something that kind of makes me stand out, like a peacock."
Tom Haverford," So, the girls will be like, ""Hey, what's with that hat?"" I'm gonna go peacock it out."
Tom Haverford, I'll be back.
Mark Brendanawicz, Okay.
Extra," Thank you, Tony, for those inspiring twitches and blinks."
Leslie Knope,I think we're gonna meet a little earlier than what you said.
Leslie Knope, How about Monday?
Janine Restrepo,Call my secretary and we'll set it up.
Leslie Knope, Not good enough.
Janine Restrepo, Not good enough?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope, I know about things.
Janine Restrepo," Well, my schedule is my schedule."
Janine Restrepo," So, I'm just gonna get back to my dessert."
Leslie Knope, Drive much?
Janine Restrepo,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Your husband.
Leslie Knope, Does he drive much out of state? I know that your husband is a drunk driver.
Leslie Knope, My mom told me.
Janine Restrepo, What do you want?
Leslie Knope,Uh Just saying.
Janine Restrepo,Get out.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, I'm so sorry.
Janine Restrepo, Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope, I don't know what came over me.
Janine Restrepo, Leave.
Leslie Knope, I hope your husband gets help and that you have a long and happy marriage.
Tom Haverford," Stacy, Becky tells me that you two are both real estate agents."
Tom Haverford, That must be fun.
Extra, Uh-huh.
Mark Brendanawicz," Any cool stories you got, huh?"
Extra,Um What do you mean?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Like, I don't know, anything weird or funny happen when you guys are showing people houses?"
Extra,"Um One time, I forgot my keys to one of the houses."
Extra," Whoa! Oh, my God, you do that, too?"
Extra,Yeah.
Extra, I've done that.
Extra, That's the worst.
Extra," Then you have to drive all the way back, and then you have to be like, ""I forgot my keys."""
Extra,"And then they're like, ""You did that twice."""
Tom Haverford,Look at these guys! The key-forgetting twins!
Tom Haverford,I'll be right back.
Mark Brendanawicz," Can I settle, please?"
Tom Haverford,Dude.
Tom Haverford, What is your problem?
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Tom Haverford,"Becky and Stacy are both really into you, and you're blowing it with them."
Tom Haverford, And that's making them lose interest in me.
Mark Brendanawicz, Becky and Stacy are boring.
Tom Haverford," I need you back there, man."
Tom Haverford," I've seen you hook up with more trashy chicks in the last year than I can count, all right?"
Tom Haverford,"If there was a Tellenson Award for hooking up with trashy chicks all the time, you'd have several of those awards."
Tom Haverford, You're the king.
Tom Haverford, You're my hero.
Mark Brendanawicz," Tom, I'm gonna get out of here."
Mark Brendanawicz," I'll see you Monday, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins, Hi.
Ann Perkins, Come on in.
Leslie Knope," I just wanted to tell you that I didn't go through with it, blackmailing that woman."
Leslie Knope," I tried, but I just couldn't do it."
Ann Perkins, Good.
Ann Perkins, That's a good thing.
Ann Perkins, It wasn't you.
Ann Perkins," You know, there was definitely some truth about that thing you said about me and Andy."
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, What?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins, I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope," Me, too."
Ann Perkins, Oh.
Andy Dwyer, Whoa! Hey! What the hell? Oh.
Andy Dwyer," Hi, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer, I thought you were a dude.
Leslie Knope, The people who win awards aren't always the best people.
Leslie Knope," I mean, I think Ann and I are really good people, and someday others will see that and we'll get our due."
Leslie Knope, Would I like to win a Tellenson Award like my mom did? Sure.
Leslie Knope," But my dad never won an award, and he was always happy."
Leslie Knope," He lives in Florida, in a cemetery."
Leslie Knope," The point is, my mom is alive and I love her."
Leslie Knope, She's one tough cookie.
Leslie Knope," That's why everybody calls her ""The Iron [bleep] of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,Fondly.
Tom Haverford," Yes, I'm married."
Tom Haverford, But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies.
Tom Haverford, The fact that I haven't even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to both of us.
Tom Haverford, You like the color orange? Carrots? You into those?

,Season: 1 Episode: 06
Leslie Knope,This is very exciting.
Leslie Knope,"We are at Saint Joseph's Medical Center because, today, Andy Dwyer is getting his casts off."
Leslie Knope,"It is a great day for Andy, and it's a wonderful day for my subcommittee."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,Your boobs are dead.
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Tom Haverford,"Wow, it's like a sweaty pinata."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, my iPod!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah!"
Andy Dwyer,My pirate!
Leslie Knope,"Doctor, if I may, could I keep that cast, please?"
Dr. Harris,"It's a highly disgusting request, but I don't see why not."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"This is a symbol of new beginnings, a symbol of hope, and of our project."
Leslie Knope,We will build this park!
Andy Dwyer,"It is gonna feel so good to walk again, finally."
Dr. Harris,Easy!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no!"
Dr. Harris,"Yeah, they might be a little weak at first."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, guys."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome back into the world of walking, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ann Perkins,I just wanted to say--
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, everyone!"
Leslie Knope,Ann wants to say something.
Ann Perkins,I wanted to thank you all for being so supportive.
Ann Perkins,"When Andy fell in the pit, I didn't expect anyone in government to reach out to us."
Ann Perkins,"So, thanks."
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're welcome, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, when are you gonna tell them about my show?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Ann Perkins,Andy's band is playing a show.
Ann Perkins,And we want you all to come.
Andy Dwyer,"It's gonna be a party, so check your suits at the door."
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna get crazy.
Ann Perkins,"Andy's band is really good, and it's been driving him nuts that he can't play."
Ann Perkins,He's been writing all these songs about things that are physically near him.
Andy Dwyer,Sandwich!
Andy Dwyer,Are you turkey or ham?
Ann Perkins,Ham.
Andy Dwyer,Lamp!
Andy Dwyer,Wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched
Mark Brendanawicz,What kind of music does your band play?
Andy Dwyer,"You know, I don't really like to define it, but it's like Matchbox Twenty meets The Fray."
Tom Haverford,"So, rock."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, again, I don't really like to define it."
April Ludgate,I totally get what you mean.
Leslie Knope,"So, I would love to come to this thing."
Leslie Knope,When is it?
Ann Perkins,Tonight at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I can't go.
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Leslie Knope,My mom set up this meeting.
Leslie Knope,It's like a political tete-a-tete with a local bigwig.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, you're not gonna go?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you guys."
Leslie Knope,You know how I love mixing work into my personal life.
Leslie Knope,"This guy is important, and he has valuable information that could help us build a park."
Leslie Knope,But I wanna go to the concert!
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Ann Perkins,Play hooky!
Ann Perkins,Blow off the meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wanna go to that concert so bad, but I have to go to the meeting."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,"But I'll meet up with you guys after the tete-a-tete, I promise."
Nate,"Hey, Mark, congratulations."
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thanks, Nate."
Mark Brendanawicz,For what?
Nate,You got that speed bump thing taken care of.
Nate,Finally.
Nate,Nice work.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yay.
Mark Brendanawicz,There used to be this huge speed bump in the center of town.
Mark Brendanawicz,It was insane.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I got it lowered 2 inches."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Apparently, what I can achieve in government can literally be measured."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Dr. Harris."
Ann Perkins,"Andy's playing a show tonight, and we'd love it if you came by."
Ann Perkins,I think there's gonna be a good turnout at Andy's show tonight.
Ann Perkins,He wrote this new song about what happened to him called The Pit.
Ann Perkins,"It's one of those rare songs that rocks really hard, and also informs people about a small public works project."
Dr. Harris,"So, Andy's doing well?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's a little shaky still, but that's to be expected."
Dr. Harris,"Well, not really."
Dr. Harris,"If he had his casts removed two weeks ago, the muscles wouldn't have atrophied so much."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, two weeks ago?"
Dr. Harris,That's when they were scheduled to come off.
Ann Perkins,But he told me that you told him he should wait.
Dr. Harris,No.
Dr. Harris,He rescheduled.
Dr. Harris,"Said it was personal, that he'd explain later, but then he never explained."
Ann Perkins,I have waited on him hand and foot for two months.
Dr. Harris,"Well, I guess that explains it."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's up, people of Pawnee?"
Andy Dwyer,All right!
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh In just a minute, Scarecrow Boat is gonna rock it out."
Andy Dwyer,Please be patient while we rock out the equipment setup.
Andy Dwyer,The band has had a few different names over the years.
Andy Dwyer,"We started, we were Teddy Bear Suicide, but then we changed it to Mouse Rat."
Andy Dwyer,Uh.
Andy Dwyer,"Then we were God Hates Figs, Department of Homeland Obscurity, Flames for Flames, Muscle Confusion, Nothing Rhymes with Orange, then Everything Rhymes with Orange, Punch Face Champions, Rad Wagon, Puppy Pendulum, Possum Pendulum, Penis Pendulum, Hand Rail Suicide, Angel Snack, Just the Tip, Three Skin Jet Black Pope, we went back to Mouse Rat, and now we are Scarecrow Boat."
Andy Dwyer,"God, when I hear myself say Scarecrow Boat out loud, I kind of hate it."
Leslie Knope,"Now, you know that we're gonna be building a park on a residential lot, so, of course we're gonna have to get the zoning codes approved and amended by our city council."
George Gernway,What kind of movies do you like?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Uh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, documentaries, political thrillers."
George Gernway,I like all kinds of movies.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"So, I brought some pictures of the lot, and you can tell that the houses are very close to it."
Leslie Knope,How difficult is rezoning in your town?
Leslie Knope,Could you go into detail a little bit about that?
George Gernway,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Great.
George Gernway,It's refreshing to be with someone who actually likes talking about government issues.
George Gernway,Most of the women I go out with find it boring.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you have to have zoning codes, or else the whole thing could be chaos."
George Gernway,Your mother mentioned that you don't date much.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I've been focusing on my career.
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
George Gernway,I haven't been dating much either since my divorce.
George Gernway,It hasn't been easy.
George Gernway,"And I'm coping, but it was tough on the kids."
George Gernway,"Not my kids, 'cause they're grownup, but it was tough on their kids."
George Gernway,Shouldn't bring up my divorce on a first date.
George Gernway,But I feel I can tell you anything.
Leslie Knope,Uh
George Gernway,I think it's going quite well.
George Gernway,And she looks like a young Sandy Duncan.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Mom."
Leslie Knope,He thinks we're on a date.
Leslie Knope,Did you tell him we were on a date?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Honey, if I told you it was a date, you never would've gone."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You're not getting any younger.
Leslie Knope,"Well, neither is he."
Leslie Knope,And he's 62 years old.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Just go back in there and finish the dinner.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, how are you?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Parks Department."
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Mark."
Ron Swanson,"This is Beth, my exwife Tammy's better looking sister."
Beth,Nice to meet you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Nice to meet you.
Mark Brendanawicz,You guys are together?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Ron Swanson,My exwife Tammy cheated on me.
Ron Swanson,Then we divorced.
Ron Swanson,"Then last week, I ran into her sister Beth here."
Ron Swanson,"Turns out she hates Tammy, too, so we've started dating."
Ron Swanson,It's like a fairy tale.
Beth,"Yeah, Tammy stinks."
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,I want you to meet my wife.
Wendy,Hi.
Wendy,I'm Wendy Haverford.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're Tom's wife.
Wendy,Don't hold it against me.
Tom Haverford,Look at how hot she is.
Tom Haverford,Isn't that crazy?
Tom Haverford,And she's a surgeon.
Tom Haverford,She makes a ton of money!
Tom Haverford,Bam!
April Ludgate,This is Derek.
Mark Brendanawicz,Cool.
Mark Brendanawicz,How long have you guys been dating?
April Ludgate,We're just friends.
April Ludgate,He's like the gayest person I've ever met.
April Ludgate,But I make out with him when I'm drunk sometimes.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, if you don't wanna talk to me, you can just say so."
April Ludgate,I don't wanna talk to you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Apparently, tonight, I'm the Parks Department's seventh wheel."
George Gernway,This is my oldest son.
George Gernway,He's a very no nonsense person like yourself.
George Gernway,And this is my youngest.
George Gernway,He's about your age.
Leslie Knope,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,"So, did you give any more thought to those zoning code questions I asked you?"
George Gernway,Oh.
George Gernway,"Come on, enough business."
George Gernway,Let's have some fun!
George Gernway,Try some of my chicken.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
George Gernway,Just a taste.
George Gernway,Have a little taste of chicken!
George Gernway,Just a bit!
George Gernway,Just a taste!
George Gernway,"Chicken, chicken, chicken!"
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
George Gernway,"Delicious, right?"
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
George Gernway,I really like this restaurant.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's a great place for a business meeting.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Ann Perkins,We need to talk.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, hey."
Andy Dwyer,We're just about to start.
Andy Dwyer,Could you grab me a triple whiskey water?
Ann Perkins,"You would like that, wouldn't you?"
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Ann Perkins,You have two perfectly good legs.
Ann Perkins,Get it yourself.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, guys!"
Andy Dwyer,Thanks for coming out.
Andy Dwyer,We're Scarecrow Boat.
Andy Dwyer,This first song is called Menace Ball.
Andy Dwyer,"Two, three, four I know you been changing But I been changing, too You say that you've moved on"
George Gernway,Thank you.
George Gernway,What kind of movies do you like?
Leslie Knope,You already asked me that.
George Gernway,Oh.
George Gernway,Sorry.
George Gernway,Senior moment.
George Gernway,"Hey, am I keeping you from something?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"My friend Andy is playing in a band tonight, and I kind of wanted to go."
George Gernway,"Well, if you want to go to the rock show, I don't mind."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Are you sure?
George Gernway,Sure!
George Gernway,I haven't been to a rock show in a long time.
George Gernway,The last rock show I went to was the Everly Brothers.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
George Gernway,You like the Everly Brothers?
Leslie Knope,They're my favorite rock group.
George Gernway,They're so good.
George Gernway,I am getting very positive signals.
Andy Dwyer,You and me together You and me forever You and me together forever Together forever
Andy Dwyer,"All right, take five, guys."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna go acoustic.
Andy Dwyer,"This next song is dedicated to her, my girlfriend, Ann."
Andy Dwyer,I call it Ann.
Andy Dwyer,Ann
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, the band's really good."
Mark Brendanawicz,I liked that song Grapple Hound.
Ann Perkins,Gossip Town?
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,"My only criticism, I hate the name of the band."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, they should change their name to Big, Lying Baby."
Ann Perkins,Or Where's My Sandwich?
Ann Perkins,Or Don't Forget To Bring Home Beers After Work.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Since you brought it up, I'm just gonna say it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't get you and… I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I mean, I like Andy a lot."
Mark Brendanawicz,But there's tons of guys out there who have jobs and who respect you and think you're attractive.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,You mean guys like you
Mark Brendanawicz,No!
Ann Perkins,for instance?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no, no, no, not me."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Good, 'cause, for a second there, I thought you were hitting on me in front of my boyfriend."
Mark Brendanawicz,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,Not my style.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Even though you did just call him a big, lying baby."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I do find you attractive.
Ann Perkins,"So, you are hitting on me."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not.
Mark Brendanawicz,I promise you.
Mark Brendanawicz,"But if I were, would you be interested?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Let me tell you why, because I'm in a crappy mood, and I don't really appreciate what's happening right here."
Ann Perkins,"Number one, you've never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than a week."
Ann Perkins,"Number two, the girls"
Mark Brendanawicz,That's fine.
Ann Perkins,Just you do choose to spend the week with
Mark Brendanawicz,That's enough.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's enough.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I was not trying to ask you out, I promise."
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm glad we avoided that."
Andy Dwyer,Pit!
Andy Dwyer,"I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit Pit!"
Andy Dwyer,"I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in that pit"
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you very much, everybody!"
Andy Dwyer,We are Scarecrow Boat!
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,Screw it!
Andy Dwyer,We are Mouse Rat!
Andy Dwyer,Thank you very much!
Andy Dwyer,Good night!
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I missed it?
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,Who's your friend?
George Gernway,I'm George.
George Gernway,I'm Leslie's date.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,He's my date.
Leslie Knope,George Gernway.
Leslie Knope,He's the City Manager in Eagleton.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, George Gernway."
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"This is my wife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,She's my age.
Wendy,Hi.
George Gernway,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea why Ann is upset with me.
Andy Dwyer,But I do know she's too nice to yell at me in front of all these people.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I am not leaving this bar."
Tom Haverford,"So, I heard you went to Indiana State."
George Gernway,Yes.
Tom Haverford,My buddy Todd went there.
Tom Haverford,Maybe you know him.
Tom Haverford,What year did you graduate?
George Gernway,1968
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"Todd graduated in 2005, so you probably missed him."
Tom Haverford,How was your date with Leslie?
Andy Dwyer,"We change the band name, and then we send the demo out."
Andy Dwyer,We're completely ready---
Ann Perkins,"Andy, let's go."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm just debriefing with the band."
Andy Dwyer,It's just gonna be just one second.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Leslie Knope!
Andy Dwyer,I'm so glad you made it.
Andy Dwyer,You have to meet my band.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, band!"
Burly,Hey.
Burly,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry that I missed your songs.
Leslie Knope,Is there any way that you guys could do like an encore or something?
Andy Dwyer,An encore.
Andy Dwyer,I like it.
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, let's get our stuff out of the boxes."
Ann Perkins,Let's go.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, forget it."
Ann Perkins,"No, we're going home."
Leslie Knope,"No, don't leave."
Leslie Knope,I just got here.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, she's here with her dad."
Andy Dwyer,It'd be kind of rude to not do at least one more song.
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, let's go."
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,We're gonna go.
Ann Perkins,I'll call you tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"This weekend, guys."
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,Dead or asleep?
Tom Haverford,Dead or asleep?
Leslie Knope,George.
Leslie Knope,George!
George Gernway,Oh.
George Gernway,"Look at me, out like a light."
George Gernway,I think I should head home now.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to meet you.
George Gernway,It was fun.
George Gernway,I had a nice time.
George Gernway,Don't think I'll go out with her again.
George Gernway,There was just no spark.
Wendy,How did Leslie meet her boyfriend?
Tom Haverford,She used to read him books at the senior center.
Beth,Wow.
Beth,How old is he?
Tom Haverford,"He's six, but he has Benjamin Button Disease."
Beth,Whoa.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, who wants to see me climb a tree?"
Tom Haverford,I do!
Wendy,I do!
Mark Brendanawicz,Deputy Director Knope.
Mark Brendanawicz,Where do you think you're going?
Leslie Knope,Home.
Leslie Knope,It's been a really crappy night.
Mark Brendanawicz,Have a beer with me.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe my mom tried to set me up with an 80 year old man.
Leslie Knope,I went to dinner tonight with somebody's grandpa.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,That guy was too young for you.
Mark Brendanawicz, You should be dating guys in their early hundreds.
Mark Brendanawicz," I'm telling you, you should be dating men that Al Roker announces their birthdays."
Leslie Knope, Hey! Congratulations are in order.
Leslie Knope, I heard that you got that speed bump thing through.
Mark Brendanawicz, Don't make fun of me.
Leslie Knope, I'm not.
Mark Brendanawicz," Oh, yeah."
Mark Brendanawicz, I made a bump into a smaller bump.
Mark Brendanawicz, It's a great day for America.
Leslie Knope, What are you talking about? That thing was a pain in the butt.
Leslie Knope, You fixed a problem.
Leslie Knope, That's what we're supposed to do.
Leslie Knope, Mark and I are really connecting tonight.
Leslie Knope, Like we connected that night when we made love five years ago.
Leslie Knope, There's actually a lot of similarities between those two nights.
Leslie Knope, That time we were also at a bar.
Leslie Knope, And he was also pretty drunk.
Leslie Knope," If you could put anything in the park, what would you put in there?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay--
Leslie Knope,Don't over-think it.
Mark Brendanawicz," Keep it simple, nice shady trees, lots of grass, benches."
Leslie Knope, A picnic table?
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Mark Brendanawicz, Water feature.
Mark Brendanawicz," Like, huge rocks to be climbing on."
Mark Brendanawicz, A play area for the kids.
Leslie Knope," God, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope, I would live in that park.
Mark Brendanawicz, But then you'd be homeless.
Bartender," Hey, we're closing up."
Leslie Knope, Oh.
Leslie Knope, What time is it? I should go.
Mark Brendanawicz," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! We're getting drinks to go."
Mark Brendanawicz, Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz, Beers to go!
Leslie Knope,Where are we going? All the bars are closed.
Mark Brendanawicz, You think I can get my beer bottle in that shopping cart right there?
Leslie Knope,"What? Mark, don't."
Leslie Knope, This pit isn't a dump.
Mark Brendanawicz," Yes, it is."
Mark Brendanawicz," Look around, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz," I mean, there's crap everywhere."
Mark Brendanawicz, One beer bottle is not gonna make any difference.
Mark Brendanawicz, Damn it! I was so close there!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so"
Mark Brendanawicz,It was pretty close!
Leslie Knope,So far to the left! So far to the left!
Mark Brendanawicz,You think you can do any better?
Leslie Knope,"No, please."
Leslie Knope, I don't want anyone to see! I'm the Deputy Director of Parks
Mark Brendanawicz,"You're the Deputy Director of Parks and blah blah-- You know, nobody's gonna see it."
Mark Brendanawicz, Go on and chuck it.
Mark Brendanawicz," Unbelievable! That's unbelievable! You missed the entire pit, which is huge, by the way."
Andy Dwyer, I didn't do anything wrong.
Ann Perkins, You didn't do anything wrong?
Andy Dwyer,Mmm-mmm.
Ann Perkins, I waited on you hand and foot.
Ann Perkins," And it was exhausting! I fed you meals, and you could've had your casts off two weeks ago!"
Andy Dwyer,That is not true.
Ann Perkins, It's not true? So you're calling Dr. Harris a liar?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ann Perkins, I'm gonna call Dr. Harris right now.
Ann Perkins, How about that?
Andy Dwyer,You call him! You get me on the phone with Dr. Harris.
Ann Perkins, Yes.
Ann Perkins, Yes.
Ann Perkins, I will.
Andy Dwyer, Don't call him right now!
Ann Perkins,Why?
Andy Dwyer,Because it's late.
Andy Dwyer," Listen, just put the phone down."
Andy Dwyer, Fine! You want the truth?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Andy Dwyer," Could I have gotten my casts off two weeks ago? Technically, yes."
Andy Dwyer," But I really, really like it when you serve me food."
Ann Perkins, Get out.
Ann Perkins, Get out of my house.
Andy Dwyer, But what--
Ann Perkins,"Take a walk with your overly-healed legs, and let me think about this relationship."
Leslie Knope," Okay, this pit."
Leslie Knope, Give it to me straight.
Leslie Knope, Are we ever gonna turn it into a park?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, this is already a park! Look, I mean, you got Dirt Slide over here, you got Ring Around The Diaper you could play there."
Mark Brendanawicz," You've got Duck, Duck, Glass you could play right there."
Mark Brendanawicz, Mystery Trash.
Mark Brendanawicz," What's not to love about this park, right here, now?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"I wish we could turn it into a pit, frankly, don't you?"
Leslie Knope," But, seriously, I mean, really?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Honestly, Leslie, it's gonna be a long, uphill battle."
Mark Brendanawicz, You are gonna be super annoyed with all the people that want you to fail.
Mark Brendanawicz," There is a sea of red tape, endless roadblocks."
Mark Brendanawicz," So, yeah, I don't know."
Mark Brendanawicz, I don't know.
Leslie Knope, Screw it.
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna try to do it anyway.
Leslie Knope," I mean, Kennedy put a man on the moon."
Mark Brendanawicz, He did.
Leslie Knope, I can build one park.
Mark Brendanawicz, I really admire your tenacity.
Leslie Knope, I really admire you.
Leslie Knope," No, no."
Leslie Knope," Wait, what am I doing?"
Leslie Knope,This isn't the way I want this to happen again.
Mark Brendanawicz," Leslie, it's not that big a deal."
Leslie Knope," I think you should go home, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz," All right, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz, I'm sorry.
Mark Brendanawicz, I'm gonna get out of here.
Mark Brendanawicz, Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz, I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope," It's okay, it's"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Mark, are you all right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow.
Leslie Knope," Are you okay? Oh, my God!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Leslie Knope, Help!
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Leslie Knope, Help!
Mark Brendanawicz,Go get some help.
Leslie Knope, Help!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, babe! Baby, open up! That guy Mark just fell in the pit!"
Ann Perkins,What?
Andy Dwyer,You know that guy Mark?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, He just fell in the pit!
Andy Dwyer,You gotta go check it out.
Andy Dwyer, You're a nurse.
Andy Dwyer, I think he'd probably be hurt.
Andy Dwyer," Seriously, it's pretty bad! Pit! I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit The pit! I fell in it, the pit   "

Ron Swanson,"Okay, here's the situation."
Leslie Knope,Your parents went away on a week's vacation.
Leslie Knope,They left the keys to the brand new Porsche.
Leslie Knope,Would they mind?
Leslie Knope,"Well, of course not."
Leslie Knope,"I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah!"
Leslie Knope,"Of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot Pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girly girl walking I picked up my car phone To perpetrate like I was talking"
Leslie Knope,"Sunroof was open, the music was high And that girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car I can't believe it!"
Leslie Knope,I made a mistake But parents are the same No matter time nor place So to all you kids all across the land No need to argue Parents just don't understand Yeah!
Donna Meagle,All right!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Just a little something I know.
Leslie Knope,"So, what's up?"
Ron Swanson,Someone is on fire in Ramsett Park.
Ron Swanson,They need you to get down there right away.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I've been spending the summer doing a lot of zoo promotions.
All,For he's a jolly good fellow
Leslie Knope,Parrots live a very long time.
Leslie Knope,So we had a birthday party for a parrot that turned 60.
All,which nobody can deny
Leslie Knope,"Chimpanzees are very smart, so we had them graduate from college."
Leslie Knope,"And they like to fling their feces, so we were hoping that they would fling their hats."
Leslie Knope,But they just flung their feces.
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Zoo recently purchased two South African blackfooted penguins, Tux and Flipper."
Leslie Knope,"And as part of our zoo promotion, we are going to give them a marriage ceremony, because they mate for life."
Leslie Knope,"Tux, do you take Flipper, to be your lawfully wedded wife?"
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,I do!
Leslie Knope,"By the power vested in me from the Department of Parks and Recreation, I now pronounce you husband and wife!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, at least they're married."
Extra,Are they making babies?
Zookeeper,"Well, not those two."
Zookeeper,Those are both boy penguins.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Zookeeper,Tux and Flipper are both boys.
Zookeeper,"So you should have pronounced them husband and husband, technically."
April Ludgate,That's awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Still, you couldn't have asked for better weather."
Leslie Knope,"Brendanawicz, you big sandwich eater."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, you can cut it out, now."
Leslie Knope,"Just to be clear, that was a friend punch."
Leslie Knope,There was no flirtatious meaning behind that playful punch I just gave your arm.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I do understand."
Mark Brendanawicz,You've made it abundantly clear that there's no romantic element to our relationship in any way.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it good to be able to just kind of horse around like this as friends?
Mark Brendanawicz,It is.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,I really hit rock bottom that night.
Mark Brendanawicz,And I mean that I literally fell to the bottom of a pit and hit a rock.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I remember laying there thinking, ""There's probably a good reason why I'm down here and single."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"And then I started thinking, ""I need morphine."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah, I hear you made two male penguins very happy today."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You're making history, Knope."
Mark Brendanawicz,I like that.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Sticking your neck out, you know."
Leslie Knope,"No, I didn't stick my neck out."
Leslie Knope,It was an accident.
Mark Brendanawicz,Out of the mainstream.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think that's cool.
Leslie Knope,I'm in the mainstream.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Not out of it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Social activism.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Uh-uh.
Leslie Knope,People in this town don't really like their government employees being activists.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, a garbage man was suspended for wearing a Live Strong bracelet."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Leslie, some guy who owns a gay bar sent you a cake."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has a gay bar?
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,The Bulge.
Ron Swanson,It's behind my house.
Leslie Knope,The Bulge is a gay bar?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, the nights I've wasted there."
Tom Haverford,"""Leslie!"""
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, girrrrrrrrl!"""
Tom Haverford,With eight R's.
Tom Haverford,"""Thank you for supporting the cause of gay marriage."""
Tom Haverford,"""You rock!"""
Tom Haverford,"""The boys at The Bulge."""
Leslie Knope,They thought that was a political gesture?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nobody eat that cake."
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Leslie Knope,Step into my office.
Tom Haverford,That's also my office.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, whatever."
Leslie Knope,I know that you are not gay.
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,But you're effeminate.
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, 'cause it was featured in Details magazine."
Tom Haverford,And it's awesome.
Leslie Knope,Effeminate.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, so the point is, do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?"
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,The statement was that you're very lonely and you need a pet.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"They sent you Tshirts, too."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look, they sent us a Tshirt."
Leslie Knope,Hmm…
Tom Haverford,Mine has a collar on it.
April Ludgate,There she is.
April Ludgate,Leslie!
April Ludgate,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
April Ludgate,"This is my boyfriend, Derek, and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben."
Ben,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, sorry, what's the situation?"
April Ludgate,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,How does this work?
April Ludgate,"Derek is gay, but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek."
April Ludgate,And I hate Ben.
Derek,It's not that complicated.
Ben,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it."
Leslie Knope,So what can I do for you guys?
April Ludgate,"They just really wanted to meet you, because you're kind of like their hero now."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, April, please, it was just penguins."
April Ludgate,No!
Leslie Knope,"I'm a public servant, and I'm not allowed to take a political stance."
Ben,"But you did, and it was awesome."
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,"None of the other politicians ever take a stand, and it means a lot to the whole gay community."
April Ludgate,"It does, and we're gonna have this party tomorrow night at The Bulge, and we had something to ask you."
April Ludgate,We really want you to be the guest of honor.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Derek,It'd be amazing if you came.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you have to come."
Leslie Knope,Who made this?
April Ludgate,We did.
Derek,"Yeah, we did."
Leslie Knope,How?
April Ludgate,Photoshop.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ben,Computers.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, why are you all dolled up?"
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,I'm the guest of honor at this gay bar tonight.
Leslie Knope,I guess gay men are starting to like me.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I guess they think I'm fabulous or something.
Donna Meagle,"Well, you look good, girl."
Donna Meagle,You're gonna turn somebody tonight.
Leslie Knope,That was hands down the best interaction I've ever had with Donna.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Marcia Langman from the Society For Family Stability Foundation."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Leslie Knope,I love your top.
Marcia Langman,"Oh, thank you so much."
Marcia Langman,I was just hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have nothing to do with this, so."
Leslie Knope,"Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?"
Marcia Langman,"Well, you could resign, if you're up for it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're serious?"
Marcia Langman,"When you performed a marriage for gay penguins, using taxpayer money on government property, you were symbolically taking a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"That was not my intention, at all."
Marcia Langman,"Well, why else would you marry penguins?"
Leslie Knope,Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.
Leslie Knope,And it was.
Marcia Langman,"Leslie, are you married?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, Marcia."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, probably."
Leslie Knope,"I have a plan, but, no, not now."
Leslie Knope,Not dating anyone yet.
Leslie Knope,Focusing on my career.
Marcia Langman,I thought so.
Marcia Langman,"So you couldn't possibly understand, but when gays marry, it ruins marriage for the rest of us."
Marcia Langman,"So, either you annul the wedding, or I'll publicly ask for your resignation."
Marcia Langman,You know what?
Marcia Langman,I'm so terrible with directions.
Marcia Langman,"If I'm headed to the parking lot, do I make a left out of here, or do I go right?"
Leslie Knope,"It's a left, yeah."
Marcia Langman,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Marcia Langman,Annul the wedding!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi!
Ann Perkins,"I'm supposed to meet Leslie for lunch, but she actually works, so."
Mark Brendanawicz,Ouch!
Ann Perkins,Mark was brought to my hospital the night of the accident.
Ann Perkins,He was here for a week.
Ann Perkins,"I think when his head hit the ground, it must've knocked something loose, because he's actually a pretty nice guy now."
Ann Perkins,"And Andy, after we broke up, he told me he was going to Kansas to climb mountains."
Ann Perkins,"So, I don't really know where he is."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, have you seen that documentary about food yet?"
Ann Perkins,"No, I haven't."
Ann Perkins,But I heard it's really good.
Ann Perkins,I want to see it.
Mark Brendanawicz,We should go together.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, no."
Ann Perkins,I don't think so.
Ann Perkins,That would be like a date.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Say no more.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,I hate salad.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't want to ever keep secrets from you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me, neither."
Leslie Knope,"Look, let's invent our own secret language that only we understand."
Leslie Knope,And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"But in the meantime, I'm just gonna tell you in English."
Ann Perkins,Mark kind of asked me out.
Ann Perkins,"He weirdly asked me to go see a movie with him, and I said no, of course, but I just I just wanted to let you know."
Leslie Knope,I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"No, of course you are."
Ann Perkins,And your friendship is the most important thing to me.
Ann Perkins,And he's off-limits.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe this is a gay bar.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, especially with that heterosexual cowboy greeting us on the way in."
Leslie Knope,Where should I drink now?
Tom Haverford,There's a bar on Eighth Street called Pitchers and Catchers.
Tom Haverford,You can go there.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,Here's the plan.
Leslie Knope,"Our position is, we have no position."
Leslie Knope,"So let's just say, ""Thank you for the party, but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me."""
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I can't believe you came."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, April."
April Ludgate,Derek!
April Ludgate,It's Leslie Knope.
Derek,"Leslie Knope, you're my hero!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,That's nice.
Ben,"Leslie, you are looking hot."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I'm really enjoying this hug.
Leslie Knope,"That's so nice, but I need to tell you something."
Bartender,This one is on us.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it's free…"
Derek,Leslie Knope!
April Ludgate,"She's Leslie Knope, and she wants to recruit you!"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please."
Leslie Knope,Gentlemen.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would just like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party, especially on a night when the Colts are playing."
Extra,"We love you, Leslie!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This is green.
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to tell you that I wasn't really trying to take a stand when I married those penguins."
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,You're chanting my name.
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
All,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,I just have one thing to say!
Leslie Knope,Together we can change Pawnee forever!
Leslie Knope,Let's dance!
Tom Haverford,"Leslie Knope's in the building, y'all!"
Tom Haverford,Let's get wild!
Tom Haverford,"I've seen so many dudes from City Hall here tonight, it's crazy."
Tom Haverford,"But I guess they've seen me here, too."
Tom Haverford,"So, that's not great."
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I got your text.
Ann Perkins,Is everything okay?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,They're having a party in my honor!
Leslie Knope,Go to the bar.
Leslie Knope,"If you're my friend, you can drink for free!"
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Cool!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, and maybe next time don't use the words ""medical emergency."""
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're here!
Ann Perkins,I'm really sober!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Get a drink!
Leslie Knope,You know why tonight's fun?
Leslie Knope,'Cause everyone's so gay.
Leslie Knope,"And they know how to have fun, and the dancing!"
Leslie Knope,"Just, it's... Everyone is just who they are."
Leslie Knope,And who they are is just stone cold gay.
Leslie Knope,"Can't read my Can't read my No, he can't read my poker face Blah, blah, blah, blah My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face"
Leslie Knope,I'm having such a nice time tonight.
Leslie Knope,I've met many interesting people.
Leslie Knope,"And there's two bisexual guys here, and I got both of their phone numbers."
Leslie Knope,"My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face"
Tom Haverford,All morning.
Leslie Knope,Show me what's hot Tell me what I got Can't read my Can't read my
Ron Swanson,Have fun last night?
Leslie Knope,"I had three drinks named after me, so that's pretty fun."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, Ben and Derek are taking me shopping on Saturday."
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna find out my actual bra size.
Leslie Knope,I guess I'm kind of like queen of the gays.
Ron Swanson,Bully for you.
Ron Swanson,I just got a phone call.
Ron Swanson,They want you to go on Pawnee Today.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's huge.
Leslie Knope,What's the topic?
Ron Swanson,You.
Ron Swanson,That Marcia Langman from the family thing is calling for your resignation.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ron Swanson,You gotta go on and defend yourself.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I haven't even officially taken a stand on gay marriage.
Ron Swanson,That's funny.
Ron Swanson,Somebody just told me you were queen of the gays.
Leslie Knope,That was me.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo."
Leslie Knope,It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.
Tom Haverford,"It's the big time, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Leslie Knope,I just wish I were here under different circumstances.
Joan Callamezzo,Guess who?
Tom Haverford,Uh Megan Fox?
Tom Haverford,One of the Desperate Housewives?
Joan Callamezzo,"No, Joan Callamezzo."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Joanie!"
Tom Haverford,"What's up, gorgeous?"
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.
Leslie Knope,Tom comes on the show all the time.
Leslie Knope,Joan loves him.
Tom Haverford,You have the softest skin of any woman in Pawnee.
Joan Callamezzo,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"I wish you could reach, from your TV screen, and just touch Joan's skin for a second."
Joan Callamezzo,That's sweet.
Tom Haverford,You'd have a treat.
Joan Callamezzo,You're pretty soft yourself.
Tom Haverford,How are your kids doing?
Joan Callamezzo,They're pretty good.
Tom Haverford,Is it tough for them to have a mother that is so beautiful?
Tom Haverford,What's it like being the most attractive woman in Pawnee?
Joan Callamezzo,"You keep up those funnies, I'm gonna have to invite you over for supper."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'll have to come over for supper."
Joan Callamezzo, Oh! You must.
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer, Ann Perkins.
Andy Dwyer, How you doing?
Ann Perkins, I'm good.
Ann Perkins, How was mountain climbing?
Andy Dwyer,What? Can I come in? I just want to talk to you for a second.
Ann Perkins," Sure, yeah."
Joan Callamezzo," We have a controversial topic today, the gay penguin marriage at the Pawnee Zoo."
Joan Callamezzo," So, Marcia, what is all the fuss about?"
Marcia Langman,"The fuss is that Miss Knope claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause, and then that very night, she was the guest of honor at a pro-gay marriage rally at a bar called The Bulge."
Joan Callamezzo," Miss Knope, how do you respond?"
Leslie Knope,I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone.
Leslie Knope," I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo."
Joan Callamezzo, I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line.
Joan Callamezzo," Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right?"
Marcia Langman,"Joan, we don't want to be unreasonable."
Joan Callamezzo, Of course not.
Marcia Langman," We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign."
Leslie Knope, Oh! Is that it?
Marcia Langman,That would do it.
Leslie Knope, Anything else? You want me to jump off a building? Perform hara-kiri?
Marcia Langman,"Move to a different town? No, I kid."
Joan Callamezzo, Full of ideas here today.
Leslie Knope, This is the reason why people don't go into politics.
Leslie Knope," Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win."
Leslie Knope," I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out?"
Joan Callamezzo,"Wow, look at that! Wow, we're lighting up here."
Leslie Knope, Great.
Leslie Knope, Let's go for it.
Leslie Knope, Bring it on.
Joan Callamezzo, I've never seen that on our show before.
Leslie Knope, How does this work?
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, there Push that, and--"
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Hey! You're on the air!
Joan Callamezzo,You're on the air!
Joan Callamezzo,Good!
Caller,"Yeah, I think that lady should resign."
Leslie Knope," Okay, good."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, Next caller.
Caller, You should resign and repay your salary.
Leslie Knope," Okay, two for resign."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, Next caller.
Caller," I just want to say that I love the zoo, and the zoo is really fun."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, That's really sweet.
Caller, And I think you should resign.
Andy Dwyer, You look great.
Andy Dwyer, You look amazing.
Ann Perkins, Thanks.
Ann Perkins, You look fancy.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, yeah, the monkey suit."
Andy Dwyer," Cost 3,000 bucks, but totally worth it."
Andy Dwyer," I sold out! I got a boring office job in town, so I gotta dress up, you know, the grind."
Andy Dwyer," But I'm really happy, and I really feel like I've matured a lot."
Ann Perkins, Good! That's... I'm happy for you.
Andy Dwyer, Yeah.
Andy Dwyer," So listen, I was sitting in the cubicle the other day, just doing some thinking, and some growing"
Ann Perkins,And some maturing.
Andy Dwyer, Yes! Maturing.
Andy Dwyer," And darn it if I don't just miss you, and"
Ann Perkins,Andy.
Andy Dwyer," Well, A-Cakes, just let me I love you, and I'm just really sorry for the way that I treated you."
Andy Dwyer," I was the worst boyfriend ever, I know that, and I really think it would behoove us to give it another shot."
Ann Perkins," Yeah, look."
Ann Perkins," I'm really happy for you about your job and that you've learned some new words, but I'm sure about my decision."
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Andy Dwyer, Say no more.
Andy Dwyer," Listen, hit me up on my cell phone."
Andy Dwyer, I'll be around.
Andy Dwyer," And if you wanna talk, or grab coffee or something like that."
Andy Dwyer, Okay?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Andy Dwyer, Oh.
Andy Dwyer, Gotta get back to the office.
Andy Dwyer, Have a good one.
Andy Dwyer, Good seeing you.
Ann Perkins, Bye.
Andy Dwyer, And the hardest part about living in this pit is probably keeping my suit pressed.
Andy Dwyer, And the rats.
Andy Dwyer, It's like a freaking rat parade every night.
Andy Dwyer," I just want to be close to her house, because I need to protect her."
Andy Dwyer, 'Cause there are some weird people that live around here.
Caller," Yeah, if you let penguins get married, where does it end? I mean, would you let me marry my guinea pig?"
Caller,Because I really do want to marry my guinea pig.
Caller, I'll take my answer off the air.
Marcia Langman, I think that's a valuable point.
Leslie Knope," Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way."
Leslie Knope, You're welcome.
Leslie Knope," That penguin wedding was cute, damn it."
Leslie Knope, And I'm not gonna annul it.
Marcia Langman, I'd ask you to reconsider.
Leslie Knope," Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia."
Marcia Langman, Is that right?
Leslie Knope,"Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs! But I apologize."
Leslie Knope," I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute!"
Joan Callamezzo,Where are you from originally?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no! What did I do?"
Marcia Langman,"So, you will not be annulling the marriage?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope, I will not be annulling.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, Look at them.
Leslie Knope, They're just in their own little penguin love bubble.
Leslie Knope, I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever.
Ann Perkins,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,You know what I realized?
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,We're just animals.
Leslie Knope, We don't know anything about love.
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, I think you should go on that date with Mark.
Ann Perkins," Oh, Leslie--"
Leslie Knope,"Really, seriously."
Leslie Knope," I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours."
Ann Perkins," Look, I told you I'm not going on a date with him."
Leslie Knope," Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope," If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him."
Leslie Knope," But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it."
Leslie Knope, All that's important to me is that we're still friends.
Ann Perkins," Me, too!"
Leslie Knope,Good! Great.
Leslie Knope," Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun."
Ann Perkins, Huh?
Leslie Knope,"So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa."
Leslie Knope," Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy."
Leslie Knope, At least they'll be together.
Leslie Knope," Oh, look! Six Flags! I should take them on a water slide."
Leslie Knope, They might die.
Leslie Knope, But it would be so cute!

Ann Perkins,I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so fine with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Seriously.
Leslie Knope,It's so fine.
Leslie Knope,As long as you and I are cool.
Leslie Knope,You know my code.
Leslie Knope,Hoes before bros.
Leslie Knope,Uteruses before duderuses.
Ann Perkins,Got it.
Leslie Knope,Ovaries before brovaries.
Leslie Knope,You make such good coffee.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually."
Ann Perkins,It was kind of weird.
Leslie Knope,"But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex."
Leslie Knope,"You know, we slept together six years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm over it."
Leslie Knope,Or am I?
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope,This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.
Leslie Knope,"A community garden, right in the middle of the pit."
Leslie Knope,We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.
Leslie Knope,And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.
Tom Haverford,It's so hot.
Tom Haverford,I had to get some more iced tea.
Leslie Knope,People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.
Leslie Knope,And Tom is our master horticulturist.
Leslie Knope,He knows all the scientific names for everything.
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Like this.
Leslie Knope,"What's this, Tom?"
Tom Haverford,"Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems."
Tom Haverford,"Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers."
Leslie Knope,And those over there?
Tom Haverford,Those are some Diddys.
Tom Haverford,Those are some Bone Thugs-n-Harmony-ums right here.
Leslie Knope,Growing beautifully.
Tom Haverford,Those Ludacrises are coming in great.
Leslie Knope,"Look, someone planted something new."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Leslie Knope,"What do you think, carrots?"
Leslie Knope,"If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands."
Leslie Knope,Maybe some kind of spice?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, did you get my texts?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Did you get my emails?
Ron Swanson,Mmmmmm.
Leslie Knope,Did you see that I paged you?
Ron Swanson,I did not.
Leslie Knope,Did you check your voicemail?
Ron Swanson,I didn't.
Leslie Knope,We have a criminal emergency on our hands.
Leslie Knope,Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Call the cops.
Leslie Knope,That'll leak to the press.
Leslie Knope,"Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding."
Ron Swanson,You don't have funding.
Leslie Knope,And we never will if this gets out.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here."
Ron Swanson,I have a hernia.
Ron Swanson,I've had it for a while.
Ron Swanson,"And I've been ignoring it, successfully."
Ron Swanson,"But this morning, I made the mistake of sneezing."
Ron Swanson,"But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso, I'm good, I got this."
Leslie Knope,We need to find out who we're dealing with.
Leslie Knope,Who is this person?
Leslie Knope,Who is this kingpin?
Tom Haverford,"It's a 13 year old kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together."
Leslie Knope,"I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana."
Leslie Knope,I ate a brownie once.
Leslie Knope,At a party in college.
Leslie Knope,It was intense.
Leslie Knope,"It was kind of indescribable, actually."
Leslie Knope,I felt like I was floating.
Leslie Knope,Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.
Leslie Knope,It was just an insanely good brownie.
Leslie Knope,"You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal."
Leslie Knope,"Cause we flip the headline, and it's not ""Community Garden Infested With Pot."""
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone."""
Leslie Knope,We got to catch this guy.
Leslie Knope,"Get the van, meet me at 7:00."
Leslie Knope,It's stakeout time.
Ron Swanson,April?
April Ludgate,Yeah?
Ron Swanson,"Get my lunch for me, please."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Like, order you something?"
Ron Swanson,"No, get it."
Ron Swanson,From there.
April Ludgate,Is this some kind of weird power trip?
Ron Swanson,Please.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,That'll be all.
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,I have stakeout supplies.
Leslie Knope,This is stuff that we're probably going to need.
Leslie Knope,"We have notepads, pencils and pencil case."
Leslie Knope,Shakable whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,Cameras.
Leslie Knope,Gorp.
Leslie Knope,And candy necklaces.
Leslie Knope,It's like we're real police.
Leslie Knope,And I made us a mix CD.
Leslie Knope,It's all filled with songs about people watching people.
Leslie Knope,It's mostly Sting.
Leslie Knope,"And look, I put our faces on there."
Tom Haverford,It's really cool.
Leslie Knope,Are you going to wear that shirt?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,You like it?
Leslie Knope,Tommy Hilfiger?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Tom Haverford,Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here."
Leslie Knope,You should be wearing something like this.
Leslie Knope,Take this.
Leslie Knope,Wear black.
Leslie Knope,Black is what you wear on a stakeout.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to figure out how this works."
Leslie Knope,Just let me focus up on this.
Tom Haverford,Pretty bummed this fits.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, take a test shot."
Tom Haverford,You ready?
Tom Haverford,Just focus up on the pit.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Tom Haverford,Focus up right where the--
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Tom Haverford,Focus up right where the weed is--
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Ann Perkins,Leslie swears it's okay.
Ann Perkins,So I'm going out with Mark.
Ann Perkins,I got to get back out there.
Ann Perkins,"When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie."
Ann Perkins,And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.
Ann Perkins,Even when we saw Ratatouille.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,It's Mark.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you ready to go?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,I need another hour to get ready.
Mark Brendanawicz,Seriously?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Cause I think the movie starts in like... Oh, you're joking around right now."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,This is going to be fun.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too."
Ann Perkins,Ew!
Mark Brendanawicz,That was silly.
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Are they dating now?
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz is the man.
Tom Haverford,This is Brendanawicz's life.
Tom Haverford,"Hot chick from the newspaper, hot chick from the post office, hot chick from the hospital."
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Leslie Knope,You know her name.
Leslie Knope,Her name's Ann.
Tom Haverford,I'm just saying.
Tom Haverford,Nobody turns him down.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I did."

Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,I was conceived in America.
Tom Haverford,My parents are Indian.
Leslie Knope,Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?
Tom Haverford,"My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funny sounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics."
Leslie Knope,What about Barack Obama?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama."
Tom Haverford,"If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did you hear that noise?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's the kingpin!
Leslie Knope,Write this down.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, white male, light brown hair."

Andy Dwyer,It's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Somebody just planted a garden down there.
Andy Dwyer,"Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's our community garden."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, don't look at me."
Andy Dwyer,There's weed down there?
Andy Dwyer,I thought that was the tops of carrots.
Leslie Knope,"Right, I know."
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?"
Leslie Knope,So why don't you come to the van and help us?
Leslie Knope,We're trying to catch the guy.
Leslie Knope,And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.
Andy Dwyer,I was supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.
Andy Dwyer,He's like 20 minutes late.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,Do you live here?
Ron Swanson,April?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Do you live here?
Ron Swanson,No.
April Ludgate,Catch.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I thought so."

Ron Swanson,It's just a minor medical issue.
April Ludgate,AIDS?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'm safe.
April Ludgate,Blindness?
Ron Swanson,No.
April Ludgate,Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?

Ron Swanson,"Yes, please."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"But I rode my bike here, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Ron Swanson,Are you still here?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I just wanted to see if you could tell.
Ron Swanson,Are you still here?
Andy Dwyer,It is really great to have somebody to talk to.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, oh, man."
Andy Dwyer,So how's Ann?
Andy Dwyer,She's doing good?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous."
Andy Dwyer,How's she doing?

Leslie Knope,You want one?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, all right."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"All I've had is fruits and vegetables, for weeks now."

Andy Dwyer,Mmmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, bring me back two cheeseburgers and a green tea."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,You got to be kidding me.
Ann Perkins,"So, that was fun."
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,It really was.
Ann Perkins,Surprisingly fun.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,I have been a perfect gentleman this evening.
Mark Brendanawicz,"In fact, watch this."
Mark Brendanawicz,I would like you to now please invite me in for a nightcap.
Ann Perkins,Not a chance.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,Just... Watch what I'm going to do.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz,Just ask me in for a nightcap.
Ann Perkins,Will you come in for a nightcap?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, I will."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Damn!
Mark Brendanawicz,Drat!
Mark Brendanawicz,I was going to plan to not…
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait."
Mark Brendanawicz,To say no.
Ann Perkins,"Look, that guy's trying to break into that van."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know what, it does look like he's breaking into that van."
Mark Brendanawicz,I just
Phone,9-1-1.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, there."
Leslie Knope,"So, Andy, do you, like, spy on Ann from the pit?"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,I just like being nearby.
Andy Dwyer,"That way, if she wants me back, I can be at her house, like, in two seconds, before she changes her mind."
Leslie Knope,I don't really know how healthy that is.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you guys aren't even dating anymore."
Leslie Knope,She might be dating somebody else.
Andy Dwyer,Is she?
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,Is she dating somebody else?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,You just said Ann might be dating somebody else.
Andy Dwyer,Is she?
Leslie Knope,I didn't say that.
Andy Dwyer,Who is she dating?
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,Mark.
Andy Dwyer,That's cool.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Dave Sanderson,641 to base.
Dave Sanderson,I'm at the vehicle now.
Dave Sanderson,"How you doing tonight, sir?"
Tom Haverford,"I'm all right, Officer."
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Dave Sanderson,I'm responding to a 911 call about a suspicious person breaking into a van.
Dave Sanderson,I need you to step out and show me some ID.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's okay."
Tom Haverford,My name is Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,I work for the Parks Department.
Tom Haverford,I just got locked out of the van.
Tom Haverford,I had to jimmy my way back in.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, why don't you jimmy your way out and show me some ID."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I just told you my ID."
Tom Haverford,"So, what's the crime here?"
Tom Haverford,Parking while Indian?
Dave Sanderson,"No, there's no stereotypes about Indians sitting in vehicles."
Tom Haverford,"All right, fine."
Tom Haverford,Here's my ID.
Tom Haverford,"Nice job, Paul Blart."
Tom Haverford,"Why don't you head back to the mall, make sure nobody's breaking into Lady Foot Locker?"
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,I'm very close right now to placing you under arrest for disorderly conduct.
Dave Sanderson,Step out of the van.
Tom Haverford,I'll step out of your mama's van.
Tom Haverford,I didn't do anything!
Tom Haverford,"I'm a city employee, man!"
Tom Haverford,Come on!
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Ron Swanson,Motion sensors.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What happened to the guy that was in that van?
Tow Person,Cops took him.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Andy Dwyer,Ann and Mark!
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,It's Ann and Mark!
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Mark Brendanawicz,We caught a criminal.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you know about this?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he was breaking into this van and they dragged him away."
Ann Perkins,It was crazy.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right here.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,"If you could just stop writing for a second, and just focus here, because--"
Dave Sanderson,"Ma'am, ma'am, as I've told you several times already, this is a police matter."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it doesn't seem to matter to the police!"
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Nice job with that.
Dave Sanderson,But let's--
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you a question.
Leslie Knope,Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,"And thankfully, that's not what happened."
Dave Sanderson,"Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Thank you, Officer."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Let's just go home, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's go home."
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,No!
Mark Brendanawicz,Easy!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie--
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, come with me, please."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope, I'd like to come with you.
Dave Sanderson," Your friend, he acted like an ass."
Dave Sanderson," And you got to believe me, he didn't give me a choice."
Leslie Knope," Your name's Dave, right? Can I call you Dave?"
Dave Sanderson,"My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50- 50."
Leslie Knope," Hate to break it to you, Dave."
Leslie Knope, You really stepped in it.
Dave Sanderson, What?
Leslie Knope,"I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner."
Leslie Knope," If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope, You heard me.
Leslie Knope, Ron Swanson.
Dave Sanderson, What branch of government are you in?
Leslie Knope,Parks and Recreation.
Dave Sanderson, Parks and Recreation?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope, Do I stutter?
Dave Sanderson," Look, Ms. Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay? I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert."
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope," Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk."
Leslie Knope, It's just--
Dave Sanderson,"No, I'm being serious."
Dave Sanderson, We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.
Dave Sanderson," Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date."
Dave Sanderson," We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy."
Leslie Knope," Okay, look."
Leslie Knope, Tom and I were in that van together.
Leslie Knope," We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it."
Leslie Knope," I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy."
Leslie Knope, I took the pictures.
Leslie Knope, My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover.
Leslie Knope, It's been a very long night.
Leslie Knope," But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail."
Leslie Knope," Well, they're going to release him in a little while."
Ann Perkins, Thank God.
Mark Brendanawicz, Should I get you guys home right now?
Leslie Knope,"You know, you two go ahead."
Leslie Knope, I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.
Ann Perkins, Are you sure?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, prison changes a man."
Leslie Knope, I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.
Mark Brendanawicz," Well, okay, then."
Mark Brendanawicz," See you, Leslie."
April Ludgate, Yo.
April Ludgate, I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys.
April Ludgate, You ready?
Ron Swanson,I was born ready.
Ron Swanson, I'm Ron [bleep] Swanson.
Ron Swanson, Easy.
Ron Swanson, Care-- Careful.
Ron Swanson, Take--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in."
Mark Brendanawicz, Terrible things happened last time.
Mark Brendanawicz," So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow."
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz, Okay.
Ann Perkins, Bye.
Ann Perkins, Hey.
Ann Perkins, You kind of kissed me.
Mark Brendanawicz," Yes, I did! And now we both have herpes."
Mark Brendanawicz, I'll see you later.
Tom Haverford, Leslie.
Tom Haverford, Thanks for waiting.
Tom Haverford, I appreciate it.
Leslie Knope," Mother Teresa, it's not your chocolate."
Leslie Knope, Don't-- Get your hands off that.
Tom Haverford, Wake up.
Leslie Knope, What? Is this your house? Where are we?
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Dave Sanderson, You're awake.
Leslie Knope," Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope, Thanks for the coat.
Dave Sanderson, It's no problem.
Dave Sanderson, You can keep it.
Leslie Knope, Really?
Dave Sanderson,"Actually, no."
Dave Sanderson, I need that for my uniform.
Dave Sanderson, But I can give you a ride back to your car.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, And we'll talk about the coat.
Dave Sanderson, I can't give it to you.
Dave Sanderson, Do you understand?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Dave Sanderson," So, where's that marijuana at?"
Leslie Knope, It's down in the garden.
Tom Haverford," Good meeting you, man! We should grab a drink or something sometime."
Leslie Knope, I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.
Leslie Knope," That's all that matters, you know? That Ann is home and she's okay."
Leslie Knope, And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home.
Leslie Knope, Just important that they're both in their homes--
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford, Mark's an idiot.
Tom Haverford, You can do a lot better than him.
Tom Haverford, Forget about him.
Leslie Knope," Thanks, Tom."
Tom Haverford, I didn't mean me.
Tom Haverford," Keep it in your pants, Knope."
Leslie Knope," I swear to God, it actually-- It was there"
Dave Sanderson,These are carrots.
Leslie Knope, Duh! You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana?
Dave Sanderson,"Is that the house there, where your best friend lives? Where she saw the van from?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson, Okay.
Dave Sanderson, I get it.
Leslie Knope, What?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date."
Leslie Knope," No, I did not."
Leslie Knope, There actually was weed here
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson, I think it's kind of cute.
Dave Sanderson, I like Miss Knope.
Dave Sanderson, I liked her.
Dave Sanderson," I got to say, I--"
Dave Sanderson,"When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable."
Dave Sanderson, Miss Knope was attractive to me.
Dave Sanderson," As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor."
Dave Sanderson, I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate.
Dave Sanderson, Can we not I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Leslie Knope, What a crazy night.
Leslie Knope," Huh, partner? Want to go get some breakfast?"
Tom Haverford,What? No! Take me home.
Tom Haverford, What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on."
Leslie Knope, I wonder if mini golf is open.
Tom Haverford, Home!
Ann Perkins,Especially if you're going to I know.
Tom Haverford, Anndanawicz! What're you guys doing? Eating? Love it.
Tom Haverford," Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night."
Tom Haverford, That was cool.
Tom Haverford, Peace!
Mark Brendanawicz,"We didn't think you were a pervert, we thought you were a criminal."
Ann Perkins," For the record, I still actually kind of think he's a pervert."

Leslie Knope,"Good morning, everyone."
Leslie Knope,A couple of announcements.
Leslie Knope,"As we all know, Ron is recovering from his hernia surgery."
Leslie Knope,So I got him flowers from all of us.
Leslie Knope,"So everybody needs to pitch in, like, 90 dollars."
April Ludgate,90 dollars?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because I ordered a beautiful bouquet of daffodils, from a website, after a few glasses of wine."
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, I think you might be getting some daffodils, too."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you're definitely getting some."
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,Time will tell.
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm leaving early tonight because I am a judge in the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Tom Haverford,You get to be a judge in that thing?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously."
Tom Haverford,But I want to be a judge.
April Ludgate,I can't believe you like beauty pageants.
Leslie Knope,"April, whoever Miss Pawnee is, is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town."
Leslie Knope,"And as a judge, let me assure you that this year's Miss Pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise."
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,The girls from Talent and Poise gonna be there?
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,Talent and Poise.
Tom Haverford,It's the strip club by the VA hospital.
Tom Haverford,I have some meetings there.
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,What's disgusting is the Glitter Factory.
Tom Haverford,Do not go to the Glitter Factory.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
April Ludgate,"So, I was just at The Grind and I thought you might want an iced mocha with extra, extra whipped cream."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, April."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
April Ludgate,"Oh, by the way, completely unrelated, I just signed up for the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant."
Leslie Knope,That's wonderful.
Leslie Knope,"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge."
Leslie Knope,"So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy."
April Ludgate,Beauty pageants are idiotic.
April Ludgate,But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets 600 dollars.
April Ludgate,I can be idiotic for 600 dollars.
April Ludgate,"So, are you gonna vote for me, sister?"
Leslie Knope,"April, it's unethical for me to show you favoritism."
Leslie Knope,You and I are like family.
April Ludgate,The coffee is 7 dollars.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Tom Haverford,Just bump that clown.
Tom Haverford,Tell them they already have another Asian judge.
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you so much, I owe you."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Peace.
Tom Haverford,Guess who's also gonna be a judge in the beauty pageant?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How?
Tom Haverford,I know a guy.
Tom Haverford,I had to call in a few favors.
Tom Haverford,"But if you don't call in favors to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What you doing in these parts?
Dave Sanderson,I just came by to see the murals.
Dave Sanderson,This one's pretty amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, this one's a beauty."
Leslie Knope,"You know, in the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven."
Leslie Knope,"The original title of this was ""A Lively Fisting."""
Leslie Knope,"But you know, they had to change it for obvious reasons."
Dave Sanderson,She's got him by the hair pretty good there.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie's really cool, and she's smart."
Dave Sanderson,It's a little intimidating.
Dave Sanderson,"To tell you the truth, I didn't come here to look at the murals."
Dave Sanderson,I came to ask her on a date.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, Leslie, I really like you."
Dave Sanderson,"And I was wondering if maybe you'd want to get a cup of coffee or something, sometime."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah, sure."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Let me check my schedule.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's see.
Dave Sanderson,Is that your grandma?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's Madeleine Albright.
Dave Sanderson,That's her name?
Dave Sanderson,"Cause I usually just call mine ""Nana."""
Leslie Knope,"No, that's Madeleine Albright."
Leslie Knope,The first female Secretary of State.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, so, not-- That's not your grandma, then."
Dave Sanderson,All right.
Dave Sanderson,I got it.
Dave Sanderson,How's that schedule looking?
Leslie Knope,"Good, a couple days are free."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we could just, you know"
Dave Sanderson, Just lock it in later?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,Talk later about it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Ladies.
Leslie Knope,You want to hear something awful?
Leslie Knope,He didn't even know who Madeleine Albright was.
Ann Perkins,Who?
Leslie Knope,"Not you, too."
Leslie Knope,"Madeleine Albright, the first female Secretary of State."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,Who didn't know?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave."
Leslie Knope,That cop that I met.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I just don't know if I can date someone who doesn't share my interests.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, could you date someone who doesn't love giving vaccinations?"
Ann Perkins,I've never dated anyone who loves giving vaccinations.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Weird question for you.
Ann Perkins,Are you handy?
Ann Perkins,"Like, can you fix things?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, what's broken?"
Ann Perkins,My shower.

Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow judges."
Leslie Knope,"I am Judge Leslie Knope and this is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,He's also gonna be a judge.
Jessica Wicks,Hi.
Jessica Wicks,"Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994."
Tom Haverford,I recognized you right away.
Tom Haverford,And may I say that you look even more beautiful now than you did when you won the crown.
Jessica Wicks,"Ooh, I like you!"
Ray Holstead,Hello.
Ray Holstead,"Ray Holstead, Ray's Sandwich Place."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course, Ray."

Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom and I are very happy to be here."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm sure between the five of us, we will choose the most well-rounded, intelligent, modern and forward thinking woman to represent our fine town."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,Tom?
Tom Haverford,You don't believe me?
Tom Haverford,Watch.
Tom Haverford,"34C, 36B, 34B, 34D. 32A? How did you get in here?"

Announcer,"And our first one up is Trish lanetta, whose talent is baton."
Tom Haverford,My girl Trish is talented.
Leslie Knope,She's not even twirling the baton.
April Ludgate,I'm going to do impressions.
Announcer,"Oh, celebrity impressions."
Announcer,That's wild.
Announcer,Wild stuff.
April Ludgate,Yep.
April Ludgate,This is an impression of my sister.
April Ludgate,"Hi, I'm Natalie."
April Ludgate,I love Ritalin and have low self-esteem.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"This is an impression of my boss, Leslie Knope."
April Ludgate,Women should do everything.
April Ludgate,Check out my four color pen.
April Ludgate,"Hey, everybody."
April Ludgate,Listen up while I talk about some really important stuff.
April Ludgate,"Parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, parks, Michelle Obama, parks."
April Ludgate,"Gay penguins, parks, sugar, parks."
Leslie Knope,She got me.
Leslie Knope,She got me good.
Leslie Knope,She got
Extra,"Ooh It's so good, it's so good It's so good, it's so good, it's so good"
Tom Haverford,I'm texting Trish to tell her how good she did earlier.
Leslie Knope,"No, Susan isn't a perfect 10."
Leslie Knope,"But in my mind, Susan is the perfect Miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Her values are strong, her commitment to her job is very admirable, she has a real sense of…"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,Over here.
Ann Perkins,How's it going in here?
Mark Brendanawicz,Good.
Mark Brendanawicz,I hooked your toilet up to your shower.
Mark Brendanawicz,"That's what you wanted, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,Excellent.
Ann Perkins,Was that Andy?
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,I know you're in there because I can see you through the screen.
Andy Dwyer,Ann!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,Do you live down here?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you live down here."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe this is happening!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I can't be at my house and see my exboyfriend living in a hole in my backyard like a gopher.
Ann Perkins,"That's so weird, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I have been trying really hard not to bother you."
Andy Dwyer,"Like, when you had that barbecue last week, I didn't come up, even though it smelled so good."
Ann Perkins,You've been here a whole week?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,One week only.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I guess I guess that's the office you were telling me about that you go to work to every day."
Ann Perkins,Excellent.
Andy Dwyer,Listen.
Andy Dwyer,Are we gonna talk about anything other than the lies that I told you?
Ann Perkins,I can't do this right now.
Ann Perkins,I have a guy fixing my bathroom.
Ann Perkins,I got to go.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that's cool."
Andy Dwyer,"I got to zoom out, too, 'cause I have some people coming over."
Andy Dwyer,"So, why don't you call first next time?"
Andy Dwyer,You know the way out.
Announcer,"All right, it's time now for the dreaded Q&A."
Announcer,And the first question goes to Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I have a question for the hot one."
Tom Haverford,"First off, I just want to say I'm a little bit surprised, because I didn't think angels could fly so low."
Trish Ianetta,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"You truly are a beautiful, beautiful woman."
Trish Ianetta,You're so funny.
Tom Haverford,You're funny.
Tom Haverford,You're funny.
Announcer,"Do you have a question, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have a real question, if you don't mind, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Trish, Alexis de Tocqueville called America ""The Great Experiment."""
Leslie Knope,What can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment?
Trish Ianetta,"Well, uh, I think that America is the land of the free, which is a wonderful thing, and also the brave, where people can live, and no one can ever take that away from you and it never gives up."
Trish Ianetta,But the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me.
Trish Ianetta,"No offense to anyone out there, but if it were up to me and my family, I would actually call it ""Ourmerica,"" and not ""Theirmerica."""
Trish Ianetta,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Don't applaud that.
Leslie Knope,"No, she didn't-- She didn't answer my question."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, you don't think it's weird that my exboyfriend lives in a tent in the pit outside my house?"
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not ideal.
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe you should try to relax.
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe take one of those Ativans I saw in the medicine cabinet.
Ann Perkins,Dude!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, I peeked."
Mark Brendanawicz,I also didn't see any toothpaste.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you not use toothpaste?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I always knew he was lazy, but this is, like, a new low for him."
Mark Brendanawicz,I feel like we should invite him inside.
Mark Brendanawicz,Have you not been listening to anything I just said?
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, it's just It's raining outside, and he's living in a pit, you know?"
Announcer,"Okay, folks, just a couple more contestants, and then the judges will decide our next Miss Pawnee, a winner of 600 dollars in gift certificates to Big Archie's Sporting Goods and Emerson Fencing Company."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,We don't get cash?
April Ludgate,This is for a fence?
Announcer,"Well, it won't cover a whole fence."
Announcer,But it will defray the cost considerably!
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I quit.
April Ludgate,I quit.
Announcer,"Okay, I guess she really is quitting."
April Ludgate,"No, I didn't win."
April Ludgate,But at least I didn't make any new friendships.
Tom Haverford,"So, how long do we have to pretend to deliberate until we go back out there?"
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,We're all in agreement.
Tom Haverford,"The hot one, by a landslide."
Leslie Knope,"Well, her name is Trish."
Leslie Knope,"And I don't think we should rush this, you know?"
Jessica Wicks,What is there to talk about?
Jessica Wicks,"I mean, I thought Trish was just adorable."
Leslie Knope,"Well, take Susan, for example."
Leslie Knope,I think--
Tom Haverford,Susan Boring Stories?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,It's Trish.
Tom Haverford,Let's go back out there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hold on, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Look, whoever we choose is going to represent the ideal woman for a year."
Leslie Knope,She'll be someone that little girls in South Central Indiana look up to.
Leslie Knope,"Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Consider yourselves sequestered.
Leslie Knope,"I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial."
Leslie Knope,But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.
Jessica Wicks,"Look, I am the only one here who has entered and won this contest in the past."
Jessica Wicks,And I think Trish is a no-brainer.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, may I ask, what was your talent?"
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, I packed a suitcase."
Ray Holstead,"I have to say, Leslie does make a good point."
Ray Holstead,Trish is not the brightest bulb in the bunch.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ray."
Leslie Knope,"Good, I like what you're saying."
Leslie Knope,Let's keep talking.
Ann Perkins,Just stand over there and don't drip on anything.
Andy Dwyer,"Is Mark the guy who's ""fixing your shower""?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know about you, Mark, but I've seen a ton of porn."
Andy Dwyer,"And I know what ""fixing your shower"" means."
Ann Perkins,Andy…
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, you guys are on a date."
Andy Dwyer,That's cool.
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's all right."
Andy Dwyer,Don't let me interrupt your date.
Ann Perkins,Keep eating.
Andy Dwyer,I already ate.
Andy Dwyer,I'm super full.
Andy Dwyer,I don't I don't want any.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so, it's still 3- 2 for Trish."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, ""Who is the most impressive woman here tonight?"""
Announcer,It's the hot one.
Announcer,Trish lanetta!
Mark Brendanawicz,These are amazing.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you... Do you put a little hot sauce on these or something?
Ann Perkins,A good chef never reveals her secrets.
Andy Dwyer,It's hot sauce.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is an extraordinary cook.
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,Memories.
Ann Perkins, Do you want some more? Are you hungry still?
Andy Dwyer,"You know what's funny? I was just sitting over here on the couch and I was thinking, that there was once a time when Mark used to be the stranger in the house."
Andy Dwyer, And now it's me.
Leslie Knope," Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,  Why don't we just take a moment to give a round of applause to all the contestants this evening?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope, Especially Susan.
Leslie Knope," This isn't the first time that Susans have lost to Trishes, and it won't be the last."
Leslie Knope," Susan and I will continue on until the women of Pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies, but by the contents of their brains."
Leslie Knope," And, Trish, I may not have voted for you, but now is the time for us to come together."
Leslie Knope," I hope you honor this crown with dignity, and a devotion to all--"
Trish Ianetta,"One, two, three!"
Jessica Wicks,"One, two, three!"
Andy Dwyer,"As usual, Ann, a delicious meal."
Andy Dwyer, Are we doing anything in the way of dessert or coffee?
Ann Perkins,We are leaving.
Andy Dwyer," Okay, I get it."
Andy Dwyer, Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer, I'm very good at picking up signals.
Andy Dwyer," Let's go, Mark."
Ann Perkins," No, dummy."
Ann Perkins, Just you.
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Andy Dwyer, All right.
Ann Perkins, Take care of yourself.
Andy Dwyer," Just don't worry about me, Ann."
Andy Dwyer, Okay? I'll be fine.
Andy Dwyer," That went really well! We had dinner! I got to see her! Oh, God, I was so tempted to look back at her."
Andy Dwyer, Was she looking? I had to walk so slow.
Andy Dwyer, A good day.
Tom Haverford," Well, well, well, look who's here."
Tom Haverford, It's Officer John McClane.
Tom Haverford," Welcome to the party, pal."
Dave Sanderson, Who's that?
Tom Haverford,Die Hard.
Dave Sanderson, The battery?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope, What are you doing here?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you know the other day I asked you if you wanted to have coffee?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson, You said yes.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Dave Sanderson," Okay, and then afterwards, I saw you again, you kind of acted like you didn't want to have coffee anymore."
Dave Sanderson, We left it kind of open-ended.
Leslie Knope, We did.
Dave Sanderson, And that's made me uncomfortable.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Dave Sanderson," So I thought I'd come in and ask you, and just get some clearance on this."
Leslie Knope," Dave, I like you."
Dave Sanderson," I like you, too."
Dave Sanderson," Okay, so, we'll get coffee, then."
Leslie Knope, But I'm just busy.
Leslie Knope," Right now, my schedule is just so full."
Dave Sanderson, Okay.
Dave Sanderson," Okay, I get it."
Dave Sanderson," Look, I'm not a guy who plays games."
Dave Sanderson," Okay, I just came to tell you that I like you, and I like coffee and I If you want to get some coffee, here's my number."
Dave Sanderson," Hey, coming through, buddy."
Dave Sanderson, Hey.
Dave Sanderson, I got your message.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Thanks for coming.
Leslie Knope," Look, I'd love to go out with you."
Leslie Knope, How about Friday for dinner?
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,Great.
Dave Sanderson," Hey, will Sandra Day O'Connor and Michelle Obama and Condoleezza Rice and Nancy Pelosi, are they gonna join us?"
Leslie Knope,"No, they will not be joining us."
Dave Sanderson," Okay, well, good, 'cause I don't happen to agree with Miss Pelosi's views about the Troubled Assets Relief Program."
Leslie Knope, Hmm.
Dave Sanderson, I looked that up to impress you.
Leslie Knope, I figured.
Dave Sanderson, Yeah.
Tom Haverford," If you guys like grilling, you want to come over and use my grill--"
Tom Haverford,"Look, let me do you a favor."
Tom Haverford, Take a key.
Tom Haverford," Just come by, grill up whatever you want."
Tom Haverford, This is one of my favorite pick-up strategies.
Tom Haverford, I'm constantly giving one of my keys.
Trish Ianetta, This is your house key?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford, I just happened to have a spare.
Tom Haverford," Just come by, go for a dip, whenever you want."
Tom Haverford," So far, none of them have shown up."
Ann Perkins," That's a very appealing offer, thank you."
Tom Haverford, Matter of time.
Tom Haverford," Hey, Craig."
Craig," Hey, Tommy."
Tom Haverford," Fifty more copies, please."
Craig, You got it.
Tom Haverford, I have been robbed twice.

Councilman Dexhart,"And to my wife, I apologize."
Councilman Dexhart,"All I can say is I wasn't just having sex, I was making love to a beautiful woman and her boyfriend, and a third person, whose name I never learned."
Councilman Dexhart,"Furthermore, it was wrong of me to say I was building houses for the underprivileged, when I was actually having four way sex in a cave in Brazil."
Tom Haverford,I bet cave sex is insane.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Tom Haverford,Because of the echoes and the humidity.
Donna Meagle,Mmmhmm.
Councilman Dexhart,"In my defense, it was my birthday and I really wanted to do it."
Leslie Knope,I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.
Leslie Knope,"Personally, all I care about is Councilman Dexhart's policies."
Leslie Knope,Not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex.
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, I heard he was."
Perd Hapley,One more shocking revelation in a story that just won't stop unfolding.
Perd Hapley,It turns out Councilman Dexhart may have also had sex with a prostitute in the limousine on the way to and from the press conference where he apologized for having an affair.
Perd Hapley,"Perd Hapley, Channel Four Eyewitness News."
Mark Brendanawicz,Why does anybody wanna run for public office?
Mark Brendanawicz,You're just asking to have your entire life exposed.
Tom Haverford,"Well, if you're squeaky clean, like I am, there's no problem."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, you're married, and you hit on women constantly."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but I've never sealed the deal."
Tom Haverford,Just window shopping.
Tom Haverford,"You can fly to Brazil, just don't enter the cave."
Tom Haverford,Am I right?
Tom Haverford,Up top!
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sure that you think that you're clean, but I bet that we could find something on you."
Tom Haverford,"I changed my name, which is legal, and once in high school, a girl beat me in a wrestling match."
Tom Haverford,That's it.
Tom Haverford,I bet anything I could find worse stuff on all you guys.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you suggesting a game?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm in.
Donna Meagle,I'm in.
Jerry Gergich,I'm out.
Tom Haverford,"Not an option, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,You're going down.
Jerry Gergich,"No, seriously, I really don't wanna play."
Tom Haverford,"No, no."
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, you are playing."
Tom Haverford,We're gonna nail you.
Ron Swanson,"I will play, too, if only to prove that I can find more dirt on you than you can on me."
April Ludgate,That's why we're all playing.
Ron Swanson,Your desk is over there.
April Ludgate,I love games that turn people against each other.
Donna Meagle,You guys will never believe what I just found on Jerry's Facebook.
April Ludgate,A friend.
April Ludgate,Burn.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, again, I'd really rather not play."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,What are you guys doing?
April Ludgate,Trying to see who has the least amount of dirt on them in case someone wants to run for office.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, it ain't Jerry."
Dave Sanderson,That's for sure.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, he's got a couple of 359s on him."
Dave Sanderson,Public urination.
Jerry Gergich,I don't like this game.
Jerry Gergich,I just don't like it.
Dave Sanderson,He's probably gonna go anger pee in the courtyard.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you crazy park people, I'm out of here."
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie, I'll see you tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, will be our first official... First date."
Dave Sanderson,Roger that.
Leslie Knope,Copy.
Leslie Knope,Over and out.
Leslie Knope,Dave and I are going on our first date tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,I'm not nervous.
Leslie Knope,Why should I be nervous?
Leslie Knope,We're just two people going on a first date.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to be nervous about.
Leslie Knope,That was my phone.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hi there.
Mark Brendanawicz,What are you... What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,Just having lunch with Leslie.
Ann Perkins,What are you up to?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I'm looking for scandalous information about my coworkers, for a game that we're playing."
Ann Perkins,"My taxes pay your salary, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"And he looked up at me, and he said, ""Thank you."""
Ann Perkins,"""You saved my life."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, listen, I'm really nervous about this date tomorrow night."
Leslie Knope,"Do you have, like, a first date outfit I can borrow?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, a pair of cargo pants?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I wouldn't go with a cargo pant."
Leslie Knope,"What about, like, a sexy hat?"
Ann Perkins,I don't know what that even is.
Leslie Knope,Helping already.
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna just come by after work today?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Tonight?
Leslie Knope,Several hours from now?
Ann Perkins,Or you could just come over now?
Leslie Knope,I think that would be better.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that would give us more time."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what you doing, guys?"
Tom Haverford,Looking for dirt on me?
Tom Haverford,No point.
Tom Haverford,Give up now.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, wait, there's this."
Tom Haverford,"Everybody, I bought a Croissan'wich this morning."
Tom Haverford,This isn't even a real receipt.
Tom Haverford,Just a scrap of paper.
Ron Swanson,Taliban robes!
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Where'd you get that photo from?
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Tom."
Donna Meagle,Nice Taliban robes.
Tom Haverford,Those aren't Taliban robes.
Tom Haverford,"That's from Halloween, 10 years ago."
Tom Haverford,I was dressed like a Jedi.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm sure that the voters would be able to tell the difference.
Ron Swanson,"Mmm, looks to me like you're in the Taliban."
Tom Haverford,"Well, did everybody know that Ron's ex-wife, Tammy, is actually his second ex-wife named Tammy?"
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,"Ron has two ex-wives, each named Tammy."
Ron Swanson,Both of them bitches.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, my mom's name is Tammy."
Ron Swanson,What's your point?
Ron Swanson,"Tom, that was a Jaeger secret."
Ron Swanson,You just breached a Jaeger secret.
Donna Meagle,"Damn, this just heated up quick!"
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Ann Perkins,That looks great.
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Ann Perkins,"Will you be wearing it out of the store today, madame?"
Leslie Knope,"I think I will, good lady."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, while I have you, can I ask you a question?"
Ann Perkins,Shoot.
Leslie Knope,What if he asks me if I've been married?
Ann Perkins,Have you?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ann Perkins,"Well, then, say that."
Leslie Knope,But then he'll wonder why I haven't been married.
Leslie Knope,You know what I'm gonna do?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say that I was married.
Leslie Knope,"The real question is, should I say that I have kids?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys like girls that have kids, right?"
Ann Perkins,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,What if I get drunk and I talk about Darfur too much?
Leslie Knope,Or not enough?
Leslie Knope,What if I don't bring up Darfur enough?
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, relax."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I just have a few more questions for you, Ann."
Leslie Knope,What if he shows up with another woman?
Leslie Knope,What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?
Leslie Knope,"What if instead of Tic Tacs, I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?"
Ann Perkins,Those are all insane hypotheticals.
Ann Perkins,And I promise you they won't happen.
Leslie Knope,They have happened.
Leslie Knope,All of these have happened to me.
Leslie Knope,"No, there's more."
Leslie Knope,"One time, I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar."
Leslie Knope,I thought it was terrible wine.
Leslie Knope,Once I went out with a guy who wore 3D glasses the entire evening.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, one time I rode in a sidecar on a guy's motorcycle, and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs."
Leslie Knope,"Another time, I went to a really boring movie with a guy, and while I was asleep, he tried to pull out one of my teeth."
Leslie Knope,I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.
Leslie Knope,"We went out a couple times after that, but then he got weird."
Leslie Knope,"I know it sounds crazy, I'm a grown woman, but I am just not good on first dates."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, okay."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"You have a problem, and this is how we're gonna fix it."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're thinking.
Leslie Knope,"I wear an earpiece, you sit at a table nearby, you speak into a mic, you tell me what to say on the date."
Leslie Knope,"But let me tell you something, Ann, it never works."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,We are gonna go to a restaurant and have a practice date.
Ann Perkins,"I will pretend to be Dave, and you will practice on me."
Leslie Knope,That's a way better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Dave, it's me."
Leslie Knope,It's Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,It's good to see you.
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Ann Perkins,You don't wanna do that quite yet.
Leslie Knope,"So, Dave."
Leslie Knope,Let's begin our conversation.
Ann Perkins,What's on the note cards?
Leslie Knope,They're possible topics of conversation.
Ann Perkins,"""Whales, parades, electricity."""
Ann Perkins,And the rest are blank.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I couldn't think of anything else."
Ann Perkins,Leslie's in worse shape than I thought.
Ann Perkins,Is she practice laughing?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Dave You!"
Leslie Knope,"The Danish call it ""op og ned apparat,"" which literally translated means the ""up and down machine."""
Ann Perkins,"Wow, that's a thorough history of the teeter-totter."
Leslie Knope,Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora and fauna found in Pawnee.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,What's amazing--
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,Just ask me a question.
Ann Perkins,Just try to get to know me.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I can't think of anything to ask you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,My mind is blank.
Ann Perkins,Just ask me the first thing that comes to your head.
Leslie Knope,How big is it?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Wendy,"Hey, Tommy."
Wendy,Hi.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Wendy,Are you ready?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am."
Tom Haverford,Just give me one second.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Donna."
Tom Haverford,Let me ask you something.
Tom Haverford,Do you hate black people?
Donna Meagle,Excuse me?
Tom Haverford,"'Cause, apparently, in 1988, you donated money to the presidential campaign for David Duke."
April Ludgate,The KKK guy?
Donna Meagle,I got a phone call.
Donna Meagle,They said he would lower taxes.
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,How's it feel to lose so hard?
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, honey."
Tom Haverford,Let's get coffee.
Tom Haverford,Re Ron!
Tom Haverford,"You remember my wife, Wendy Haverford."
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Wendy,"Yeah, hi."
Ron Swanson,How are things at the hospital?
Wendy,"Very good, thank you."
Wendy,I just got a pediatric surgery fellowship.
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Tom Haverford,"We're celebrating, 'cause she's super rich and super hot also."
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,"Come on, Tommy."
Wendy,Cut it out.
Tom Haverford,You're super hot.
Tom Haverford,Everybody else has to deal with it.
Tom Haverford,Let's get out of here.
Tom Haverford,"See you later, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I've established a scientifically perfect ten point scale of human beauty.
Ron Swanson,"Wendy is a 7.4, which is too high for Tom, who is a 3.8."
Ron Swanson,Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Dave."
Ann Perkins,You're late.
Ann Perkins,And I can see your nipples through your dress.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ann Perkins,"In nursing school, we took a psych course on how to treat phobias with a method called ""exposure therapy."""
Ann Perkins,"So, like, if you were afraid of snakes, they would immerse you in a tank of snakes."
Ann Perkins,"So, I am going to immerse Leslie in a tank of bad date."
Ann Perkins,"You're 20 minutes late, I almost left."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,God!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was dropping my niece off."
Ann Perkins,What's your niece's name?
Leslie Knope,Torple.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,That's not a name.
Leslie Knope,I don't have a niece.
Leslie Knope,My niece's name is Stephanie.
Ann Perkins,Stop lying.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look."
Leslie Knope,There's bread.
Leslie Knope,You want some?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,I got flowers in your soup.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Leslie Knope,Just I have to go to the whiz palace.
Leslie Knope,"You know, Dave, the place where you... You know, the toilet thing."
Leslie Knope,It's a bathroom!
Leslie Knope,It's called a bathroom!
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Mark."
Jerry Gergich,A little birdie told me that you have one unpaid parking ticket.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, that's funny, because a little birdie told me that your adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana possession."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, snap!"
Jerry Gergich,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You didn't know that, huh?"
Jerry Gergich,I didn't know I was adopted.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, Jerry."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, Jerry."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm so sorry.
Jerry Gergich,I really didn't wanna play.
Mark Brendanawicz,You... That was not my intention.
Tom Haverford,It's not your fault.
Tom Haverford,He totally baited you with that unpaid parking ticket.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, could you come into my office?"
Ron Swanson,Tomato sauce.
Tom Haverford,Rontonamo Bay.
Ron Swanson,Do be seated and congratulate me.
Tom Haverford,For what?
Ron Swanson,Winning the game.
Ron Swanson,"I just found out, through some pretty impressive investigating, that your wedding was a sham."
Ron Swanson,It's a green card marriage.
Tom Haverford,That's crazy.
Tom Haverford,I was born in South Carolina.
Tom Haverford,"These colors don't run, baby."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa, Canada."
Ron Swanson,Her visa was set to expire the day after you got married at the county courthouse in front of three strangers and no family.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,We met in college.
Tom Haverford,"She wanted to work in the States, she couldn't get a permit--"
Ron Swanson,I knew it.
Ron Swanson,I knew you couldn't get a wife as hot as her.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Games aside, you gotta keep this between us."
Tom Haverford,"Don't tell anybody, please."
Ron Swanson,"Now, come on."
Ron Swanson,Don't worry.
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna turn you in.
Ron Swanson,"Just admit that when it comes to digging up dirt, I bested you in this game."
Ron Swanson,Say it.
Ron Swanson,"Say, ""I bested you."""
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,You bested me.
Tom Haverford,Is that all?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'll have your wife tonight.
Tom Haverford,What?
Ron Swanson,I'm just kidding.
Ron Swanson,Get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Why would you say that, Dave?"
Leslie Knope,"That dog was, like, my best friend."
Leslie Knope,"And when she died, it was one of--"
Ann Perkins,"Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tiffany."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I definitely wanna see you tonight."
Ann Perkins,"No, I can't really talk right now, 'cause I'm on a date with this drip."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I can ask."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, do you wanna watch a porno after this with me and my wife?"
Leslie Knope,"No, Dave."
Leslie Knope,'Cause you're disgusting.
Ann Perkins,"So, it's definitely a no?"
Leslie Knope,I don't understand why you're being so terrible.
Leslie Knope,We're just two people trying to go on a date.
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be fun.
Leslie Knope,It's just a date.
Ann Perkins,"You're right, it is."
Ann Perkins,Well done.
Ann Perkins,Sorry I had to get all medical on you.
Ann Perkins,"But now you see that even if everything goes wrong, you'll survive."
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,You coy bastard.
Tom Haverford,Mark.
Mark Brendanawicz,Tom.
Tom Haverford,"You hate Ron, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think Ron is fine.
Tom Haverford,"So, we're on the same page."
Tom Haverford,You gotta help me take this guy down.
Tom Haverford,There's gotta be something on him.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, I'm starting to feel kind of gross about this game."
Tom Haverford,It's not about the game anymore.
Tom Haverford,Ron has some serious dirt on me.
Tom Haverford,I need to balance things out.
Tom Haverford,"You must know how that feels, you got tons of dirt in your past."
Tom Haverford,"Please, you gotta help me."
Mark Brendanawicz,There is a man named Duke Silver.
Mark Brendanawicz,He hangs out at a bar in Eagleton.
Mark Brendanawicz,"He's an old friend of Ron's, maybe you should ask him."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, man."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna dig up so much dirt on this guy, there's gonna be worms all over the place."
Tom Haverford,It sounded snappier in my head.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ann is so awesome.
Leslie Knope,I'm lucky to have a friend who would spend a whole day being so mean to me.
Leslie Knope,Catch.
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your dress anymore, I'm gonna wear my own stuff."
Leslie Knope,Me power.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Ann Perkins,You're officially first date proof.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dave."
Ann Perkins,"Listen, it is impossible that he's not gonna like you."
Ann Perkins,He's gonna freak out about how awesome you are.
Leslie Knope,"No, he's not."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, he is."
Ann Perkins,He's gonna love you.
Ann Perkins,You're cool and you're sexy and you're funny and you're smart…
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Look, any guy would be lucky to date you."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hell, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Hells, yeah!"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I am awesome.
Ann Perkins,You are awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and you are, too."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"You are, too."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"You are, too, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,You're awesome.
Leslie Knope,You're awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Help, police!"
Leslie Knope,Help!
Leslie Knope,Help!
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know today is today, and it's not tomorrow, but I felt like you should know that I'm awesome, and you're lucky to have me."
Leslie Knope,"And I think our first date tomorrow is gonna go awesome, off the charts amazing."
Leslie Knope,Up top.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's do this bitch!"
Leslie Knope,I'm not scared.
Leslie Knope,Can I come and sit down for a little bit?
Leslie Knope,"Cause I walked here, 'cause... The drinking."
Dave Sanderson,I don't know…
Leslie Knope,I do know.
Leslie Knope,I'm coming inside.
Leslie Knope,"So, move, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You make a better door than a guy.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,This is gonna sound weird.
Tom Haverford,I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.
Bartender,"Yeah, he goes on in a second."
Emcee,"Ladies, ladies, ladies, it's just about that time."
Emcee,"It's with the jazziest pleasure that I bring out for you, my man, Mr. Duke Silver!"
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Dwayne."
Ron Swanson,"As always, it is a thrill to be here, during this witching hour with you lovely ladies."
Ron Swanson,"Now, relax, and let the Duke Silver Trio take you on a little journey to yourself."
Leslie Knope,Ann was helping me because I was panicking about tomorrow.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, did I say something to make you worry about--"
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Just the whole idea of first dates just kind of freak me out.
Leslie Knope,But not anymore.
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe that I was scared to go on a date with you.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you should be scared of me."
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think I need to return this sweater.
Leslie Knope,I think it fused with my shirt in the dryer or something.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, I think that's a sweater shirt combo."
Leslie Knope,I think it's going pretty well with Dave.
Leslie Knope,He wants me.
Leslie Knope,I can totally tell that he wants me.
Dave Sanderson,I'm right here.
Dave Sanderson,"You know I'm here, right?"
Leslie Knope,Did you see my bra?
Leslie Knope,Mmm?
Leslie Knope,"Bee, boop."
Leslie Knope," Guess what? I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow, the black one."
Dave Sanderson, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Can I use your bathroom?
Dave Sanderson,Yes.
Leslie Knope, Are you impressed that I know what it's called?
Dave Sanderson,"Look, maybe I ought to give you a lift home."
Leslie Knope, Good.
Leslie Knope," Well, in London, they call elevators ""lifts."""
Leslie Knope,"So, you're gonna give me an elevator home?"
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Dave Sanderson, Okay.
Dave Sanderson," Let's, Let's go."
Dave Sanderson, Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope, Let's go down to the pub.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,That's right.
Leslie Knope, To the pub.
Leslie Knope, get a pint.
Dave Sanderson, Yes.
Leslie Knope, We'll put our knickers in The Beatles records.
Dave Sanderson," Okay, yeah."
Leslie Knope,This is an English accent.
Extra, What I cannot believe is Dexhart's wife.
Extra," I mean, how clueless can you get? How did she not know this was going on? More importantly, how does she stay with him after all this? I think Dexhart's credibility"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins, Can I help you at 11:48 p.m?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, here's the whole thing."
Mark Brendanawicz, Here are all my skeletons.
Mark Brendanawicz," When I was 16, I had sex with a married woman."
Ann Perkins, Right.
Mark Brendanawicz," When I was in college, I smoked a decent amount of pot."
Ann Perkins, Uh-huh.
Mark Brendanawicz, Nothing insane.
Mark Brendanawicz, When I tell you what--
Ann Perkins,What the hell are you doing?
Mark Brendanawicz,"What I'm doing is, I'm trying to tell you that I've done some stuff that I'm not very proud of."
Mark Brendanawicz, But I like you.
Mark Brendanawicz," So, I would rather you not find out about this from anyone but me."
Mark Brendanawicz, This was a bad idea.
Ann Perkins," No, no."
Ann Perkins, It's fine.
Ann Perkins," I get what this is, and why you did it."
Mark Brendanawicz," Is there anything that you would like to share from your past, to sort of balance the scales?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins," One time this guy rang my doorbell at midnight, to brag about getting laid when he was 16, so I shot him."
Mark Brendanawicz, Good night.
Ron Swanson, It's been a real gift making sonic love to you tonight.
Ron Swanson," If you want more of the Duke, both my albums are for sale here, ""Smooth As Silver"" and ""Hi Ho, Duke""."
Ron Swanson," And look for my new CD next month, ""The Memories of Now."""
Ron Swanson," So, come see me, come talk to me, come love with me, and maybe we can walk through fire together."
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
Ron Swanson, Good night.
Tom Haverford, Duke! Huge fan.
Ron Swanson," Look, Tom."
Ron Swanson," I imagine you'll wanna tell everyone about this, but I have worked pretty hard to cultivate a certain authoritative, or intimidating image around the office."
Extra,"Can I, can I get a picture?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Tom Haverford," Say, ""I bested you!"""
Extra,I bested you.
Ron Swanson, All right.
Ron Swanson, Thanks for loving the Duke.
Extra, Thank you.
Extra, Thank you.
Tom Haverford, That... That was a lovely photo.
Ron Swanson, Truce?
Tom Haverford,Truce.
Tom Haverford, You're kidding me.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, I'm not.
Tom Haverford," You showed up at the guy's house in the middle of the night, drunk, and you didn't even sleep with him?"
Leslie Knope,Should I have?
Tom Haverford,It never hurts.
Leslie Knope, God.
Dave Sanderson, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Tom Haverford, Hey!
Dave Sanderson,You left quite a bit of stuff at my place last night.
Dave Sanderson," Purse, and earrings, and a shoe."
Leslie Knope, I am so sorry for what happened last night.
Leslie Knope," On my list of embarrassing things that I've done in my life, that was numbers one through seven."
Leslie Knope, I totally understand if you wanna cancel.
Dave Sanderson, It's okay.
Dave Sanderson, You can make it up to me tonight on our second date.
Leslie Knope, Second?
Dave Sanderson,"Well, yeah."
Dave Sanderson, Last night was our first date.
Dave Sanderson," So, that would make tonight our second."
Dave Sanderson, I'm looking forward to it.
Dave Sanderson,8 o' clock?
Leslie Knope,8 o' clock.
Dave Sanderson, You like dancing?
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Dave Sanderson,"I don't, I'm a, I don't like dancing."
Leslie Knope, Then we don't have to go.
Dave Sanderson, Okay.
Leslie Knope," Well, we went on our first date, and I didn't even know it. A.K.A, I nailed it."
Leslie Knope," No fires, no ambulances, just good old-fashioned showing up drunk at a guy's house late at night."
Councilman Dexhart," However, I wanna be clear, I have no plans to resign."
April Ludgate, Is it weird that my feelings are hurt that no one's found any dirt on me yet? Hello!
April Ludgate, I drove a riding lawn mower through a Nordstrom! There's video that I took! It's on the Internet.
April Ludgate, Nothing.
Tom Haverford, Jerry.
Tom Haverford, Plastic surgery?
Jerry Gergich,I got hit by a fire engine.
April Ludgate, You are so lucky.
Jerry Gergich, How?

,Season: 2 Episode: 05
Leslie Knope,"Today we are welcoming a delegation from the Parks Department of our sister city, Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,Our photo-op with the mayor is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm gonna need your suggestions about my wardrobe ASAP."
Tom Haverford,"I told you, gold sequin sweatpants."
Leslie Knope,"Also, remember, everyone, Venezuela is a poor country."
Leslie Knope,These men are not used to the wealth and flash that we have here in central Indiana.
Leslie Knope,Our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am a little nervous."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has kind of a tricky history with welcoming foreign visitors.
Leslie Knope,But things have changed.
Leslie Knope,"Our guests are gonna stay in a motel, for sure."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,What if they don't speak English?
Leslie Knope,"April, you know Spanish, right?"
April Ludgate,Tu entierres en tu trabajo porque tu eres enfeliz en tu vida personal.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
April Ludgate,My mom's Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate,That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Here they are.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, clean up."
Leslie Knope,Pull your thing up.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, just be Good."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, hit it."
Leslie Knope,This is my baby.
Leslie Knope,"I've put this whole trip together, and let me tell you something."
Leslie Knope,"It's not been easy, you know?"
Leslie Knope,How do you fit all of Pawnee in a 48 hour visit?
Leslie Knope,I had to drop the Rock and Roll bowling alley from our itinerary.
Leslie Knope,That was one of the most difficult phone calls I've ever had to make.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, most excellent representatives of the great Parks Department of Boraqua, Venezuela."
Leslie Knope,"I am Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and Chairwoman of the Departmental Ad Hoc Subcommittee for Pit Beautification, Leslie Knope."
Raul,It's a pleasure to meet you.
Raul,"I'm Vice Director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departamento de Parques, Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Maldonado."
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom.
Raul,"These are my colleagues, Antonio Rivera-Fonseca, Minister of Small Fountains."
Raul,"And Elvis Correja, Administrator of Hedges."
Leslie Knope,And he is?
Raul,Pay no attention to him.
Raul,"He is our intern, Johnny."
Raul,He is worthless.
Raul,We are quite tired from our trip.
Raul,"Could you have your servant collect our bags, please?"
Tom Haverford,What'd he call me?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, please."
Leslie Knope,"It's a different culture, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just be a good host.
Leslie Knope,Do this for me?
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,We will get our pathetic servant boy to fetch your luggage.
Leslie Knope,"Go, boy!"
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know you gentlemen had a long flight, but I have prepared a welcome party in your honor."
Raul,Excellent.
Raul,I like to party.
Leslie Knope,"Well, my job is to see to your every need."
Antonio,Do we just select the woman we desire?
Antonio,I will take the large black one.
Tom Haverford,Interesting choice.
Leslie Knope,What?
Raul,Do you have some kind of book with photos of the women available to us?
Raul,"If not, I will also take the sexy black one."
Donna Meagle,I am not surprised at all.
Donna Meagle,I've been to South America.
Donna Meagle,I did very well there.
Leslie Knope,I think there might've been a translation problem.
Leslie Knope,"When I said party, I meant one that did not include sex for pay."
Leslie Knope,"But one that had food and drink and dancing, that sort of thing."
Raul,"So, no women?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Off to kind of a weird start.
Leslie Knope,We have so much to learn from each other.
Leslie Knope,What kind of birds do you guys eat?
Raul,Chickens.
Leslie Knope,"Us, too!"
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Raul,What is this?
Leslie Knope,"Water, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,Agua.
Raul,"In our country, government officials drink only bottled water."
Leslie Knope,I can assure you that that water's very safe to drink.
Raul,No.
Raul,"Bottled, please."
Raul,Send the boy.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get water."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, come on!"
Raul,For your troubles.
Tom Haverford,"You got it, Chief."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, April, can you help me out a second--"
April Ludgate,"Go away, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Raul,This is a gold plated replica of the gun Hugo Chavez used in the 1992 Socialist revolution.
Raul,It is a gift.
Leslie Knope,This gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace between our two nations.
Leslie Knope,A key aspect to diplomacy is gift giving.
Leslie Knope,"The gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest, but not so nice that it shames him."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it needs to represent the local culture."
Leslie Knope,And I found the perfect thing.
Leslie Knope,"A bottle of high fructose corn syrup, made right here in Pawnee's own Sweetums factory."
Leslie Knope,Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, Sweetums!"
Leslie Knope,Since 1891.
Leslie Knope,"And eight and a half dozen rubber baby bottle nipples, also made here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Kernston's Rubber Nipples, tastes like the real thing."
Raul,Yes.
Raul,And we too are pleased to be here in your dirty alleyway.
Raul,"We thank you for the container of sap, and the bag of garbage."
Leslie Knope,"His English isn't perfect, so I don't think he realizes how insulting he's being."
Raul,"We're also sister cities with Kaesong, North Korea."
Raul,Their town is far nicer.
Leslie Knope,"That's fine, it's my job."
Leslie Knope,I'm a diplomat.
Leslie Knope,I'm not supposed to take it personally.
Raul,"We haven't been here for a very long time, but what we have seen is, really, from the bottom of our hearts, truly depressing."
Raul,"Really, really sad stuff."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, that's why people respect Hillary Clinton so much."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause, nobody takes a punch like her."
Leslie Knope,"She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world."
Raul,"It's funny because Antonio said to me, ""Can we turn this car around and say we're sick or something, or that we lost our way?"""
Raul,"Of course, that would be rude to you."
Elvis,What is your profession?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm a city planner.
Elvis,This city was planned?
Elvis,"On the drive in, I saw a tattoo parlor, next to a school next to a Taco Bell."
Elvis,It looks like it was designed by a very stupid rodent.
Ann Perkins,He's actually a pretty smart rodent.
Mark Brendanawicz,Uhoh!
Elvis,Ah!
Elvis,You have a quick wit.
Elvis,You know what?
Elvis,"I've changed my mind, I will have you for the evening."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Boy.
Mark Brendanawicz,She'll get back to you on that.
Ron Swanson,"Politically, no, I don't support Chavez."
Ron Swanson,I despise him and everything that he does.
Ron Swanson,"On the other hand, this is a pretty sweet-ass gun."
Tom Haverford,"The banana you wanted, senor."
Raul,Ah!
Raul,Finally.
Raul,You peel.
Tom Haverford,What?
Raul,"With your hands, you peel the banana."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Let's get started, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,I have a full day of activities planned.
Elvis,I would like to see where the children are fed the sweeteners.
Leslie Knope,A restaurant?
Raul,American children are fattened more efficiently than any other children in the world.
Raul,"I mean, they're like little basketballs."
Raul,"I mean, they're huge, little porkers."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,This is our thermometer!
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park.
Leslie Knope,"But I need 35,000 dollars, and the city doesn't have enough money in its budget."
Raul,I do not understand.
Leslie Knope,You've never had a budget shortage?
Elvis,No.
Raul,Venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves.
Raul,"Massive, I mean, tremendous, like, you would not believe."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Raul,"The state sells the oil, and keeps all the money, and we build whatever we want."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, well."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I do not understand."
Raul,I feel my English was very clear.
Raul,Shall I repeat?
Raul,"Venezuela, Venezuela, my country, has a lot of oil."
Raul,Oil is food for cars.
Leslie Knope,The Venezuelans are a very confident people.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, I know these guys didn't turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be."
Tom Haverford,You said they might not know what toilet paper is.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling an audible.
Leslie Knope,We can't be humble anymore.
Leslie Knope,"What we're gonna do is, we're gonna take them to our best park and we're gonna blow their socks off."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I don't think that's gonna blow their socks off."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, we'll go further."
Leslie Knope,We'll take them to Chicago and pretend it's part of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Or New York.
Leslie Knope,Or London!
Leslie Knope,"No, wait, the money's different there."
Leslie Knope,They'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,We'll go to the park.
Leslie Knope,Everybody doing okay back there?
Leslie Knope,Comfortable?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the motel we're putting you up in is really nice."
Leslie Knope,You can watch TBS.
Leslie Knope,Do you have TBS in Venezuela?
Raul,I have everything in Venezuela.
Raul,I have four satellite dishes on my estate.
Raul,"We get 14,000 channels."
Raul,Fourteen thousand.
Raul,I already know who wins Project Runway.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I'm coming over to your house then.
Raul,"I see what you're getting at, but no, thank you."
Raul,I am still primarily interested in the large black woman.
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,"Take it in, boys."
Raul,This is an embarrassment to America.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry?
Raul,You are right to want to correct this.
Leslie Knope,Correct what?
Raul,"This is the giant pit of dirt you were telling us about, is it not?"
Raul,The one you want to turn into a park?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,This is already a park.
Leslie Knope,And it's one of our best loved parks.
Elvis,Why are the trees so small?
Leslie Knope,They're not that small.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, size doesn't matter."
Raul,"Yes, it does."
Raul,Our trees are huge.
Raul,We build tunnels through them.
Raul,The parks in Boraqua are far superior.
Raul,"The park in my hometown, El parque del Este, we have a monorail, and we have an aquarium, and we have the Jaripa Amphitheater."
Raul,It's huge.
Elvis,Lady Gaga played there last week.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't have Lady Gaga."
Leslie Knope,And I don't think she's going to come here unless her career takes a very bad turn.
Leslie Knope,But we have something more beautiful than Lady Gaga.
Leslie Knope,Democracy.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna show you an example of that.
Leslie Knope,Let's go to a town hall meeting.
Tom Haverford,"Elvis, Oh Henry!"
Tom Haverford,"Raul, Butterfinger."
Tom Haverford,"Antonio, Nestle Crunch with the crispy rice removed."
Tom Haverford,"Weird choice, but for you, I got it done."
Raul,Gracias senor.
Tom Haverford,Gracias.
Tom Haverford,I find it incredibly demeaning.
Tom Haverford,But guess what?
Tom Haverford,Cash money.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna make it rain. I'm just gonna pick that up real quick.
Leslie Knope,"So, are you guys ready?"
Leslie Knope,We're about to start.
Raul,This is where you have your meetings?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the location rotates."
Leslie Knope,Sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts.
Leslie Knope,Where do you hold your meetings?
Raul,"Well, now that you ask, we usually rotate as well between different fortresses and citadels, and palaces."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,We don't need palaces.
Leslie Knope,The ideas are what shine in our meetings.
Mel,What are you?
Mel,Some kind of moron?
Mel,Why don't you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms?
Mel,They're so much more sanitary than paper towels!
Mel,Anyone knows that!
Gretel,My dog went to one of your parks and ate another dog's feces.
Gretel,And I'm going to sue you for that.
Lawrence,How do you like it?
Leslie Knope,No!
Lawrence,How do you like that?
Lawrence,Now imagine you're holding coffee.
Raul,This is outrageous.
Raul,Where are the armed men who come in to take the protesters away?
Raul,Where are they?
Raul,This kind of behavior is never tolerated in Boraqua.
Raul,"You shout like that, they put you in jail."
Raul,Right away.
Raul,"No trial, no nothing."
Raul,Journalists?
Raul,We have a special jail for journalists.
Raul,You're stealing?
Raul,Right to jail.
Raul,You're playing music too loud?
Raul,Right to jail.
Raul,Right away.
Raul,You're driving too fast?
Raul,Jail.
Raul,Slow?
Raul,Jail.
Raul,"You're charging too high prices for sweaters, glasses, you right to jail."
Raul,"You undercook fish, believe it or not, jail."
Raul,"You overcook chicken, also jail."
Raul,"Undercook, overcook."
Raul,You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up?
Raul,"Believe it or not, jail, right away."
Raul,"We have the best patients in the world, because of jail."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was tough going, but it was lively."
Leslie Knope,What did you think of the open forum?
Elvis,This meeting of ugly people yelling?
Elvis,It is like torture.
Leslie Knope,That's one perspective.
Raul,"In Boraqua, the government moves like a hot knife through butter."
Raul,"Not as this here, listening to people yelling, these fat faces turning all red?"
Raul,Are you kidding me?
Raul,We're like kings!
Raul,We walk down the street and they treat us like rock stars.
Raul,We answer to nobody.
Leslie Knope,"In a true Democracy, we believe that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable."
Lawrence,Hey!
Lawrence,These pretzels suck!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,See?
Raul,No wonder nothing ever gets done in this country.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Nothing gets done?
Leslie Knope,Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge.
Leslie Knope,Or American Idol.
Leslie Knope,Or the moon!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there."
Raul,"Look, this is not personal."
Raul,We just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting.
Leslie Knope,I think you're rude.
Leslie Knope,And I think you've been rude since you came here.
Leslie Knope,"And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!"
Raul,Hey!
Raul,Do not disrespect Chavez.
Leslie Knope,Stupid Chavez.
Raul,I just told you not to disrespect him.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I just did."
Raul,That's twice.
Leslie Knope,I don't like Chavez.
Raul,"Yes, you do."
Raul,And do not disrespect him.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Raul,"Yes, you do!"
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't, Raul."
Leslie Knope,"Look, if you don't like it here, then go, okay, Raul?"
Raul,Great.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Raul,"We're shutting up, yeah."
Raul,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Those are our pens.
Raul,Right.
Raul,We don't even need them.
Leslie Knope,"Great, then don't take them."
Raul,We didn't.
Leslie Knope,They started it.
Leslie Knope,"Look, those guys were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I may have lost my cool, but they deserved it."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Don't do that!
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Then call the Venezuelans and apologize.
Leslie Knope,"No, they were rude, arrogant, narrow minded, class A jerks!"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Then I'll call the mayor and cancel the photo-op.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ron Swanson,Do you see the problem here?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,But I don't want to!
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I was tough and direct and today I have to be charming.
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, yesterday I was Hillary Clinton, and today I'm Bill."
Tom Haverford,Gracias.
Tom Haverford,Can I get anyone anything to drink before we start?
Tom Haverford,Coffee?
Tom Haverford,Brandy?
Leslie Knope,I'd love some coffee.
Tom Haverford,"Anything, guys?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Some nuts?
Leslie Knope,I'll have some nuts.
Tom Haverford,Gummi Bears?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Tom Haverford,Apple crisps?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Granola bars?
Leslie Knope,I'll take those.
Tom Haverford,Nothing?
Tom Haverford,Sure?
Tom Haverford, Okay.
Tom Haverford, I'll be right out there if you need me.
Leslie Knope," Well, Raul, gentlemen, thank you for coming."
Leslie Knope," Well, I would just like to first say, I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday."
Leslie Knope, It was completely uncalled for.
Raul," Well, we are sorry as well."
Raul, We were very tired from our long journey.
Elvis," Also, we were a bit jealous."
Elvis, Our colleagues from Caracas are visiting their sister city of Miami.
Raul, Yeah.
Raul, They've been partying with Dwyane Wade.
Raul, They sent us all these photos and QuickTime files.
Raul," I mean, you have to see this place Miami."
Raul," Just gorgeous, everything."
Raul," There's so much soul and life everywhere! Every little tiny street, so much culture, and history! And the cars! People really take care of their cars there."
Raul," You notice that and they're a little older, but still just beautiful."
Elvis,Clean and shiny
Raul," Really, really nice."
Elvis, Yeah.
Raul," And the food, so spicy and wonderful."
Raul, We could not even believe it.
Raul, But Pawnee is really good as well.
Elvis, Yes.
Raul," In any case, I made a few phone calls, and the government of Venezuela has authorized a special gift for you."
Leslie Knope," 35,000 dollars?"
Raul,"Yes, it is to fill your pit to start to build a park."
Leslie Knope," No, no, we can't take this."
Raul," Yes, yes, yes."
Raul, Please.
Raul, We will see you later today at the photo opportunity.
Raul, And I think we're good here.
Raul, No? Okay.
Raul," Okay, gracias."
Raul, Good meeting.
Leslie Knope, I don't know.
Leslie Knope, Maybe I should return the money.
Leslie Knope," It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys."
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna return the money.
Tom Haverford, Are you crazy? You could buy a low-end Lexus with that money.
Ann Perkins," Or, you could build a park with that money."
Leslie Knope, Let's look at the pros and cons.
Ann Perkins," Pro, we could fill in the pit and build a park."
Leslie Knope," Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money."
Tom Haverford," Pro, 35,000 dollars worth of dirty money."
Leslie Knope," Con, not quite sure why that's a pro."
Mark Brendanawicz," Pro, we can fill in the pit."
Leslie Knope," Con, Ann already said that."
Leslie Knope, Pro and con never works!
Tom Haverford,"Pro, yes it does."
Leslie Knope, Fine.
Leslie Knope, Fine.
Leslie Knope, We'll keep the money.
Leslie Knope," Okay? Everybody happy? Jerry, are you happy?"
Jerry Gergich,What did I do?
Leslie Knope,"Meeting adjourned, Jerry!"
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, I still feel kind of weird about this money."
Ron Swanson, Okay.
Ron Swanson," Look, I know they've given you a hard time."
Ron Swanson," When the mayor gets here, we'll do the photo-op, they'll be out of our hair, you'll get to build your park."
Raul, Ah! Leslie! Hello.
Leslie Knope, Raul.
Leslie Knope, The mayor will be with us in just a few minutes.
Raul," If you don't mind, we would like to take a video of you to show our superiors."
Leslie Knope," Okay, sure."
Raul, Do you have the check that we gave to you?
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yes, I do."
Raul," Okay, you're gonna show it to the camera and say how much it is and what it is for."
Leslie Knope," Okay, this is a check for 35,000 dollars and it is to build a park."
Raul, How generous!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it's really generous."
Raul," Now say ""Viva Venezuela!"""
Leslie Knope,Viva Venezuela!
Raul,Viva Chavez!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Venezuela!"
Raul," ""Viva Chavez!"" Say it!"
Leslie Knope,"Aw, come on."
Leslie Knope," I don't want to ""viva"" that guy."
Raul," We just gave you 35,000 dollars."
Raul," That's worth one ""viva."""
Leslie Knope,Viva Chavez.
Raul, Yes! Viva Chavez!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, What is he saying?
April Ludgate,They are very happy.
April Ludgate, They say Hugo Chavez will love this video because it is another success for their committee.
Leslie Knope, Committee?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate, They're a Committee to Humiliate and Shame America.
Raul, It will be a good video.
Leslie Knope, The Committee to Humiliate and Shame America?
Raul,Yes.
Raul, It is Hugo Chavez's passion project.
Raul, And we just had an idea.
Raul," Why don't you call the park after Chavez? You know, you call it Hugo Chavez Park."
Raul," And you can have a nice, big fountain of his head, so that when the water is coming out he is spitting at you all the time."
Raul, You should write this down.
Leslie Knope, Viva America! Viva Pawnee! Viva Mayor Walter Gunderson!
Raul,You have offended us.
Raul, You have offended the government of Boraqua.
Raul, You are no longer our sister.
Leslie Knope," No, America is not perfect."
Leslie Knope, But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover.
Leslie Knope, Sometimes you got to get tough.
Leslie Knope," I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome."
Leslie Knope, And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone.
Leslie Knope, Unless that's what the people want.
Leslie Knope," And that, sir, is democracy."
Tom Haverford," Leslie, come see this!"
Tom Haverford,Check out this video April sent me.
April Ludgate," Hey, guys."
April Ludgate, I'm at Johnny's place in Venezuela.
April Ludgate," It's okay, I guess."
April Ludgate, He has like five million rooms.
April Ludgate, And this is only his guesthouse.
Leslie Knope, Holy cow!
April Ludgate,There's a lot of guys with guns here.
April Ludgate," It's better than my mom's house, I guess."
April Ludgate," So, tell Leslie I don't know when I'm gonna be back."
April Ludgate," Oh, and Donna's here."
Donna Meagle," Hey, guys! Hola!   "

Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Extra,20 dollars to Netflix?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Extra,20 dollars to Blockbuster Online?
Tom Haverford,Both?
Leslie Knope,I needed all eleven disks of Gossip Girl at the same time.
Extra,120 dollars in tuition to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry?
Leslie Knope,"They give you a little wand, and a diploma."
Leslie Knope,It's fun.
Tom Haverford,What did you major in?
Leslie Knope,Potions.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm gonna take you off speaker phone."
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Extra,Jessica Simpson clip-in hair extensions?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay-- Um, I wore those once."
Leslie Knope,"It was a moneyback guarantee, but I forgot to return them."
Leslie Knope,"Man Pillow, the pillow shaped like a man?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Also something called ""Bucket of Cake."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,I think someone definitely stole my credit card.
Leslie Knope,So why don't you just cancel it?
Extra,Do you wanna hear what else they purchased?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't have to refund anything."

Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"So, what does a Man Pillow look like?"
Leslie Knope,Daniel Craig.
Leslie Knope,It's for my lower back.
Keef,"My name is Keef, and I am your friend."
Keef,Are you guys my friends?
All,Yeah.
Keef,All right!
Keef,Awesome!
Keef,It is playground time!
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're here in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,It's two towns over.
Leslie Knope,"And we're all volunteering for Kaboom, a service organization that says it builds a playground in a day."
Keef,High five!
Keef,High five!
Keef,High five!
Leslie Knope,I never trust anything that comes that quickly.
Leslie Knope,That's why I don't eat Minute Rice.
Leslie Knope,"So this whole ""build a playground in a day"" thing, I mean, that's just a slogan, right?"
Keef,Nope.
Keef,"One day, 24 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Keef, that is so incredible."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I work in Parks, and I know how hard it is to get something done."
Keef,Not if you have the Kaboom spirit.
Keef,"You can look at a problem, and you can either go, ""Oh, this is a problem"" or you can kaboom, blow it up and turn it into something great."
Keef,You literally kaboom the problem.
Keef,"Come on, people!"
Keef,I see more ground than playground!
Keef,Kaboom.
Ron Swanson,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Ann Perkins,"Man, this is tough."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but just think of all the kids that'll swing on this swing: fat kids, skinny kids, brainiacs, sluts, the gay drama kids, goths, jocks, the alternative crowd."
Ann Perkins,Mmmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Hi.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,Ann.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,I'm volunteering.
Andy Dwyer,I love to volunteer.
Andy Dwyer,The key to volunteering?
Andy Dwyer,A lot of pockets.
Andy Dwyer,For putting all the food in.
Andy Dwyer,The Red Cross has amazing cookies.
Andy Dwyer,I go there all the time.
Andy Dwyer,Meals On Wheels was a bonanza.
Andy Dwyer,"Suicide Hotline, surprisingly lame spread."
Andy Dwyer,I thought I'd give back to those less fortunate than myself.
Ann Perkins,You live in a pit.
Andy Dwyer,Not anymore.
Andy Dwyer,Living with the drummer of my band.
Andy Dwyer,"Living indoors, pretty cool, not to brag."
Andy Dwyer,Kind of hard not to.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyhow, got to go, me and an old Asian lady are double-teaming some monkey bars."
Keef,"Hey, look."
Keef,I got a remote control and I'm controlling you.
Keef,Go faster.
Keef,Go faster.
Keef,"Go faster, Ron's the master."
Leslie Knope,Well.
Leslie Knope,You have been officially kaboomed.
Keef,Whoa.
Keef,Look at you two and your big kabooms.
Keef,Great job.
Keef,I got gifts.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Keef,"There you go, for you."
Keef,And one more for you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Keef,"So, you guys gonna join us tomorrow in Muncie?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I wish, but back to the real world."
Keef,"At least you guys will be kabooming somewhere, right?"
Keef,"Remember, you take a man kabooming, he kabooms for a day."
Keef,But you teach a man how to kaboom.
Keef,"Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so pumped."
Leslie Knope,Feel I could take on the world.
Ann Perkins,"I could prep, like, a thousand diagnostic tests."
Ann Perkins,In an hour.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Ann Perkins,"There it is, the pit."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Ann Perkins,There's something I wish I could kaboom.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we are."
Leslie Knope,It's just a slow boom.
Leslie Knope,"A slower, more deliberate kaboom."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Totally.
Ann Perkins,See you tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know what this mess is?
Leslie Knope,This is a list of things we have to complete before we fill in the pit behind Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,You know what this is?
Leslie Knope,This is a kaboomer.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, did you use permanent marker again?"
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, guys, I I just grabbed the wrong--"
Leslie Knope,This is a big--
Jerry Gergich,I grabbed the wrong-- 
Leslie Knope,"This is gonna open very big, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.
Leslie Knope,And this is clean.
Leslie Knope,How do we speed up the process?
Leslie Knope,How do we kaboom it?
Leslie Knope,"Rules, codes, permits, red tape."
Leslie Knope,I never realized how frustrating it is to be in the government.
Leslie Knope,"In my next life, I'm going into private industry."
Leslie Knope,Maybe strip mining.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody take out their thinking caps and rip them up."
Leslie Knope,"Then take out your doing caps, 'cause we're gonna do something today."
Tom Haverford,I have a couple of doing caps in my wallet.
Tom Haverford,That's what I call condoms.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Focus, please."
Leslie Knope,How do we cut through the red tape and how do we get this pit filled in?
Leslie Knope,Ideas?
Tom Haverford,We need to cut through the red tape and get the pit filled in.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody else needs to participate."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,These suggestions aren't gonna suggest themselves.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,This idea better be good.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,I support you.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Mark Brendanawicz,You could petition to expedite the Architecture Review Board process.
Leslie Knope,"Mark, buddy, you're not listening to me."
Leslie Knope,I want to kaboom it.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Mark Brendanawicz,Can I talk to you outside really quick?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Mark's gonna help me, so thanks for nothing, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Good job, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,So you really wanna get this pit filled in?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz,And you'll do whatever it takes?
Leslie Knope,"Mark, I am so sick of moving like a slug."
Leslie Knope,I want to move like a cheetah.
Leslie Knope,Or a slug driving a remote controlled car.
Leslie Knope,"Something more plausible than that, but fast."
Mark Brendanawicz,Would you break the rules?
Leslie Knope,I won't murder.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's good to know.
Mark Brendanawicz,But it's actually very simple.
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you wanna fill in the pit, just go fill it in."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I like that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wow."
Leslie Knope,So who gives me the go ahead to not ask for permission but ask for forgiveness?
Leslie Knope,Is it Ron?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's nobody.
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's nobody, it's you."
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to be bold.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, look."
Mark Brendanawicz,You wanna get the pit filled in?
Mark Brendanawicz,Go rent a bulldozer and fill in the freaking pit.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,What's up?
Leslie Knope,"Say you had a friend who wanted to do something good, but a little risky, and she was kind of nervous about it, and this friend is me."
Leslie Knope,What should I do?
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,"You should do it, and you should ask your friend to help you, because your friend totally has your back."
Ann Perkins,And that friend is me.
Leslie Knope,You'll help me?
Ann Perkins,"Of course, I'll do anything I can to help."
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What are we doing?
Ann Perkins,Is it dangerous?
Leslie Knope,We're not gonna murder anyone.
Leslie Knope,It was crazy.
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a single permit.
Leslie Knope,Nobody stamped anything.
Leslie Knope,"All I did was order a backhoe, and it came with a guy who runs it."
Leslie Knope,I've never rented a guy before.
Leslie Knope,I wish I knew about that during prom.
Ann Perkins,"There was a girl at my prom who was known as ""the back ho."""
Ann Perkins,Mary Dunbar.
Ann Perkins,She'd let anyone massage her back.
Leslie Knope,I'm so excited we're doing this.
Leslie Knope,And we're doing it without permission.
Leslie Knope,We're giving ourselves permission.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I had these hard hats made."
Leslie Knope,Check it out.
Leslie Knope,"Kick, Ass."
Ann Perkins,I'll take that one.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann, this is so cool."
Leslie Knope,Do you feel giddy?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud of us.
Construction Worker,"Miss Montague, you ready?"
Leslie Knope,"I didn't wanna tell him my real name, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"First, speech."
Leslie Knope,Is important moment here.
Leslie Knope,"We are about to fill this hole now, not with dirt, but with the courage of a thousand lions and the solemn memory of all of our friends who have fallen in this cursed hole."
Leslie Knope,Dump it!
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Andy Dwyer,What the [bleep].
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,I'm okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that beeping was sure annoying."
Andy Dwyer,But this is even more annoying.
Ann Perkins,I'll handle this.
Ann Perkins,"The monitor is not a toy, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Anything is a toy if you play with it.
Ann Perkins,I'll chalk that up to your concussion.
Ann Perkins,The good news is your CAT scan's clear.
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I'm really happy you're okay."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie was worried, too."
Ann Perkins,We should've checked before to see if you were home.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I told you."
Andy Dwyer,I moved out of the pit.
Andy Dwyer,I just had to go back because I forgot my headphones.
Andy Dwyer,"Then I laid down on this really comfy tarp, I saw an old cereal box I hadn't read before, so I must have drifted off."
Andy Dwyer,Next thing you know... Dirt.
Ann Perkins,Scooch up for one sec.
Ann Perkins,And back down.
Ann Perkins,There you go.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,That is perfect.
Andy Dwyer,It's like I'm lying in a cloud.
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann and Andy, just like old times."
Andy Dwyer,The pit works in mysterious ways.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry about Andy, but I'm not sorry about what I did."
Leslie Knope,What's my crime?
Leslie Knope,I got bold?
Leslie Knope,And a little negligent?
Ron Swanson,Knope!
Ron Swanson,My office!
Ron Swanson,Now!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Can I smoke in here?
Ron Swanson,You don't smoke.
Leslie Knope,Just asking if I can.
Ron Swanson,Are you high?
Leslie Knope,I'm high on kaboom.
Leslie Knope,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness."
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,"You never did ask me for permission, did you?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'm sorry to burst your ka- bubble, but I just had my ass ka- handed to me by the City Manager."
Ron Swanson,And now this entire department is ka- screwed.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry."
Ron Swanson,What the K- [bleep] were you thinking?
Ron Swanson,I would prefer that she ask me for my permission so I can say no.
Ron Swanson,I like saying no.
Ron Swanson,It lowers their enthusiasm.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Ann Perkins,"So, I brought you some clean clothes that I found at my house."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,My sexy sweater.
Andy Dwyer,It has a hole cut out over the bicep.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,No problem.
Andy Dwyer,"No, A-Cakes, seriously, thank you."
Ann Perkins,You're welcome.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,What... What are you... What do you think is happening right now?
Andy Dwyer,"A tragic accident reignited feelings you thought were long dead, and we are finally back together."
Ann Perkins,"Andy, we're not back together."
Ann Perkins,You know that I'm kind of with Mark now.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,Is that still happening?
Andy Dwyer,I don't get it.
Andy Dwyer,What does he have that I don't have?
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Everything.
Ann Perkins,"He has, literally, everything you don't have."
Ann Perkins,"A job, a car, a steady income, an address, a second pair of shoes, table manners, the ability to say ""tampon"" without giggling."
Ann Perkins,Mark has his life together.
Ann Perkins,I'll get you a different nurse.
Leslie Knope,It's awful what happened to Andy.
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes when you make an omelet, you got to break a few eggs."
Leslie Knope,What's the alternative?
Leslie Knope,No omelets at all?
Leslie Knope,Who wants to live in that kind of world?
Leslie Knope,Maybe birds.
Leslie Knope,Then all their babies would live.
Scott Braddock,Miss Knope?
Scott Braddock,Miss Knope.
Scott Braddock,Hi.
Scott Braddock,"Scott Braddock, City Attorney."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Scott."
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that you were friends with Andy.
Scott Braddock,I never met him.
Scott Braddock,What I do know is that he could sue us at the drop of a hat.
Scott Braddock,"I mean, right now, he's the most dangerous man in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Is that all you lawyers think about?
Leslie Knope,"Lawsuits, and laws and legalese?"
Scott Braddock,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can relax."
Leslie Knope,"All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, ""We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault"""
Scott Braddock,"No, no, no, no."
Scott Braddock,You can't say any of that.
Scott Braddock,It admits liability.
Scott Braddock,"You can't say ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I apologize."""
Scott Braddock,It implies guilt.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,I have to apologize.
Leslie Knope,Andy was a victim--
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""victim."""
Leslie Knope,Of an extremely unfortunate situation.
Scott Braddock,"Can't say ""unfortunate,"" and you can't say ""situation."""
Leslie Knope,"I can't say the word ""situation""?"
Scott Braddock,No.
Scott Braddock,It implies there was a situation.
Leslie Knope,Can I give him the pig?
Scott Braddock,"Yeah, the pig's fine."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I got this for you.
Leslie Knope,Hope you squeal better.
Andy Dwyer,Aw!
Leslie Knope,This is my friend Scott.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Scott."
Scott Braddock,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I just wanted to say, I am so, so"
Scott Braddock,"Mmmmmm, mmmmmm, mmm."
Leslie Knope,"Filled with emotions, as any person would."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Scott Braddock,No miming.
Leslie Knope,Uh... you were in the pit.
Scott Braddock,We're not conceding that point.
Leslie Knope,You were in a place.
Leslie Knope,We're both here now.
Leslie Knope,The government--
Scott Braddock,"No, no."
Scott Braddock,No.
Scott Braddock,We got to go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Scott Braddock,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Scott Braddock,Wendell Adams.
Wendell Adams,I'm Andrew's attorney.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, no."
Andy Dwyer,It's my only option.
Wendell Adams,"Andy, stop."
Wendell Adams,I've advised my client not to speak with you.
Wendell Adams,He's suing the City of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you're suing your hometown?"
Wendell Adams,"Andy, no."
Leslie Knope,"Look, can we just talk about this?"
Scott Braddock,"Leslie, no."
Leslie Knope,This is terrible.
Scott Braddock,"Don't say ""terrible."""
Scott Braddock,Don't look back.
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Psych.
Andy Dwyer,Leave a message after the beep.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said it's your only option?
Leslie Knope,I think we should talk.
Leslie Knope,Without lawyers present.
Leslie Knope,"If you wanna meet, just put a white chalk ""X"" on the mailbox across the street from City Hall."
Leslie Knope,Or call me back.
Leslie Knope,Just call me back.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why aren't you returning my calls?"
Leslie Knope,Is it because of your lawyer?
Leslie Knope,It's because of your lawyer.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy, it's your aunt, your mom or dad's sister."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to tell you this but your uncle has passed.
Leslie Knope,He's with Jesus now.
Leslie Knope,So we're having a memorial in 30 minutes at City Hall.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Free guitars at City Hall!
Leslie Knope,Everybody run!
Leslie Knope,"Because of a local disaster, you, Andy Dwyer, must go to the evacuation center at Pawnee City Hall."
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,That was weird.
Leslie Knope,How long have you been there?
Leslie Knope,I promise that Andy isn't suing just for the money.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, the man lived in a pit."
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ann Perkins,"He couldn't find a place to live on the Earth's surface, so he went under the ground."
Ann Perkins,You're dealing with a grown man who thinks like a gopher.
Leslie Knope,"I feel like if I could get past the lawyers and find out what's really going on, I think I could get him to drop the lawsuit."
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, is that you?"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins, We need to talk somewhere private.
Andy Dwyer," Oh! Baby, I'm back."
Leslie Knope, Thank you so--
Ann Perkins,Why are you naked?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, because of what you said."
Andy Dwyer, We're getting back together.
Ann Perkins," No, we're not."
Andy Dwyer," Yes, we are."
Andy Dwyer, You should've heard the super sexy stuff she was saying to me.
Ann Perkins," I said, ""Hey, Andy."""
Ann Perkins," ""It's Ann."""
Ann Perkins,""" Can we talk at my house?"""
Andy Dwyer,That's not how you said it.
Andy Dwyer," You were like, ""Hey, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer," ""It's Ann."""
Andy Dwyer," ""Can you talk at my house?"""
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you are such a baby."
Ann Perkins, Ugh! Literally.
Ann Perkins," Big, naked baby."
Ann Perkins, Put clothes on.
Ann Perkins, You know what? I should have seen this coming.
Leslie Knope, Has he showed up naked before?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins," Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays."
Ann Perkins, Good luck.
Leslie Knope, Where are you--
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann. Just--"
Andy Dwyer,None of your clothes fit me.
Andy Dwyer, So I'm putting an apron over the front stuff.
Andy Dwyer, Is she gone?
Leslie Knope,What did you mean when you said this was your only option?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm completely broke, and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of 100,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope, I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.
Andy Dwyer," I want Ann back, and she said she really needs a guy with a lot of money."
Leslie Knope, That doesn't sound like Ann.
Andy Dwyer," Well, I can't really do her voice, but she said she likes Mark because he's a grown-up with a bank account."
Andy Dwyer, I put two and two together.
Andy Dwyer,"100,000 dollars, I could probably get a bank account."
Leslie Knope," Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts."
Leslie Knope," I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either."
Andy Dwyer, Fine.
Andy Dwyer, I'll get a job.
Andy Dwyer, Ann will respect that.
Andy Dwyer, I can make six bucks a day playing guitar on the street.
Andy Dwyer, I can't make six bucks a day.
Leslie Knope, Wait a second.
Leslie Knope," I know I just said that maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut."
Scott Braddock,"Mr. Dwyer, we're very happy that you're dropping the suit."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, it's really terrific."
Andy Dwyer, I have my conditions.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, Never.
Leslie Knope, I will not negotiate with greedy street people.
Scott Braddock," Wait, Leslie."
Scott Braddock, Let's hear him out.
Leslie Knope, We planned this.
Andy Dwyer, Kaboom.
Scott Braddock, All right.
Scott Braddock, What's it gonna take?
Andy Dwyer,"One, I want that pit filled in, sir."
Scott Braddock, Is there a two?
Andy Dwyer,"A guaranteed starting spot in the Indianapolis Colts, inside linebacker."
Scott Braddock," Well, we can't accomplish that."
Leslie Knope," I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit."
Leslie Knope," What do you say, Scott?"
Scott Braddock, Yeah.
Scott Braddock," I mean, eventually, we're gonna fill in the pit."
Andy Dwyer," ""Eventually""?"
Andy Dwyer,I've already been injured in that thing twice.
Andy Dwyer," And I could fall in 10 more times by ""eventually."""
Andy Dwyer,"Every time I walk past that pit, I'm forced to relive the most traumatic two separate days of my life, and wanna sue you again."
Leslie Knope," Well, I hate to say it, but it really seems like Andy has us over a barrel here, Scott."
Scott Braddock, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, This is really happening.
Ann Perkins, I just can't believe it.
Leslie Knope," Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope," Usually, in these situations, a person says ""pinch me."""
Ann Perkins,Is that Andy?
Leslie Knope,"Ah, yeah."
Leslie Knope," Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess."
Ann Perkins, He settled?
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope," Gave up 100,000 dollars probably just for one thing, the city fill in the pit behind your house."
Ann Perkins, Why?
Leslie Knope,Who knows? Who knows why that gopher does what he does?
Andy Dwyer,You always hated this pit!
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, pit."
Leslie Knope," Hello, lot."
Leslie Knope, How does taking risks make me feel? Amazing.
Leslie Knope, Tingling sensation throughout my whole body.
Leslie Knope, I feel flushed.
Leslie Knope," My muscles are relaxed, yet I feel awake."
Leslie Knope, Just waves of pleasure.
Leslie Knope, I wish there was something physical that could make me feel this way.
Ann Perkins," Wow, you did it."
Leslie Knope, Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Ann Perkins,There's so much more to do.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, we're so close."
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," I'm gonna call Kaboom, and check on their availability for next year."
Ann Perkins, Great.
Extra, Information.
Leslie Knope," Hi, yes, I'd like the number for Kaboom, the national playground building charity."
Leslie Knope, I hope they can work us in.
Extra," Sorry, there's no listing for that name."
Leslie Knope, What? Are you sure?
Keef,Kaboom is a word I made up.
Keef, It's not in any dictionary.
Keef, I trick people into building playgrounds on empty lots in their neighborhoods.
Keef, It's an elaborate prank.
Keef," For my next prank, I'm going to build a hospital in a poor part of China."
Keef, They'll never see it coming.

Leslie Knope,Greg Pikitis.
Greg Pikitis,"You're the Parks lady, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's right."
Leslie Knope,I'm the Parks lady.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,And I'm here to tell you that this year it ends.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, this kid makes me crazy."
Leslie Knope,"We got a history, Greg and I."
Leslie Knope,He absolutely terrorizes the Parks system.
Leslie Knope,Every Halloween someone defaces the statue of Mayor Percy in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,"And I know it's Greg Pikitis, but I've never been able to prove it."
Leslie Knope,"He's like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond super villain criminal mastermind."
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe someone else is doing it, but I really feel like it's this kid."
Leslie Knope,"I've got the entire Parks Department watching you, my boyfriend's a cop, so don't even try it."
Greg Pikitis,I don't know what you're talking about.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I think you do."
Leslie Knope,"It ends today, Pikitis."
Leslie Knope,It ends.
Leslie Knope,Today.
Greg Pikitis,"Thanks for stopping by, Leslie."
Greg Pikitis,You look great.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Ends today.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Parks Department."
April Ludgate,"Yay, Ann's here."
Ann Perkins,"Uh, just to remind you, tonight, 7 o' clock, my house, in costume. Everybody in?"
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Yup.
Ann Perkins,Cool.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Halloween is my favorite holiday, it's just the best."
Ann Perkins,And I don't have to work.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, slutty teenage girls dressed as sexy kittens, pump your own stomachs this year."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, one more thing, the people in this room now are the people I invited, plus Leslie and Donna, so, don't tell anybody."
April Ludgate,"Who's not invited, then?"
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"What's going on, cupcake?"
Tom Haverford,Excited about the party tonight.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, you're coming?"
Ann Perkins,I was just about to tell you.
Tom Haverford,Jerry already told me.
Tom Haverford,Can't wait to see how tiny your costume is.
Tom Haverford,What time does it start?
Ann Perkins,7:00
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,These are all the possible routes from Greg Pikitis' house to the statue.
Ann Perkins,That looks like something you would find on the wall of a serial killer.
Leslie Knope,"In a way, that's a compliment."
Leslie Knope,Shows dedication.
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,"What's the big deal, anyway?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, a kid TPs some statue."
Leslie Knope,And all the trees and all the benches.
Leslie Knope,"It takes us, like, 10 days to clean his mess up."
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, Greg Pikitis sucks, and I wanna destroy him."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you destroy him early, please come by."
Leslie Knope,I will.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Extra,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,What the... Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Relax.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, William Percy."
Leslie Knope,One of Pawnee's greatest mayors.
Leslie Knope,And a true hero.
Leslie Knope,"During the Pawnee Bread Factory fire of 1922, he ran back into a burning building and saved the beloved secret recipe for Pawnee Pumpernickel."
Dave Sanderson,"Didn't, like, 30 people die in that fire?"
Leslie Knope,He wasn't Superman.
Andy Dwyer,He looks like Ron Swanson.
Andy Dwyer,Is that who this is based on?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's based on William Percy.
Leslie Knope,Were you listening to what I just said?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy."
Leslie Knope,Good news.
Leslie Knope,You're officially on the Parks Department payroll.
Leslie Knope,8 dollars an hour.
Leslie Knope,Commit this to memory.
Leslie Knope,"You see him, you stop him."
Leslie Knope,Knock his head off if you have to.
Dave Sanderson,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,But I give you permission to use excessive force.
Dave Sanderson,Don't use excessive force.
Leslie Knope,Don't go overboard.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,By any means necessary.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just stop him.
Leslie Knope,You know what I mean?
Andy Dwyer,A week ago I had nothing.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I have a part-time job."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna make 32 bucks tonight.
Andy Dwyer,I owe Leslie everything I have.
Andy Dwyer,"Which, after tonight, will be 39 bucks."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ron Swanson,Am I early?
Ann Perkins,"Nope, you are right on time."
Ron Swanson,I like your costume.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks."
Ann Perkins,Raggedy Ann.
Ann Perkins,It was one of my favorite books when I was a kid.
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,I'm a pirate.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Dr. Harris."
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Dr. Harris,Ann.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,"Um, this is Ron Swanson, from the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,I know him from that thing that I'm doing.
Ann Perkins,This is Dr. Harris.
Ron Swanson,You're a doctor.
Dr. Harris,Yup.
Ron Swanson,I meant your costume.
Dr. Harris,I got it.
Ann Perkins,"Worlds colliding, always awkward."
Leslie Knope,"8:22 p.m, suspect still with friends in parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"He looks obnoxious and irritating, even from a great distance."
Dave Sanderson,"Uh, confirmed."
Dave Sanderson,"Normally, I hate working on Halloween, but it's nice hanging out with Leslie."
Dave Sanderson,"You know, she's focused, she's committed, and she made out with me in my cop car, which is pretty neat."
Dave Sanderson,I shouldn't have said that.
Dave Sanderson,That's clear to me now.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Remember my boyfriend Derek, and his boyfriend Ben?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, hi."
Ann Perkins,It's totally okay that you didn't wear a costume.
Derek,I did.
Derek,I'm a straight person.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, sorry I'm late."
Derek,See?
Ann Perkins,Sorry it's a little bit lame right now.
Ann Perkins,But we'll get it going.
April Ludgate,I passed up a gay Halloween party to be here.
April Ludgate,Do you know how much fun gay Halloween parties are?
April Ludgate,"Last year, I saw three Jonas Brothers make out with three Robert Pattinsons."
April Ludgate,It was amazing.
Nurse,"So, you're the Mark that Ann is dating."
Mark Brendanawicz,I suppose that I am.
Nurse,We're very protective of Ann.
Nurse,We look out for her.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you kind of dropped the ball with Andy then, didn't you?"
Nurse,Aw!
Nurse,Andy.
nurse,I loved Andy.
nurse,"Ah, such a sweetheart."
Nurse,Is Andy coming tonight?
Nurse,You should get back with Andy.
Ann Perkins,Who needs a drink?
Ann Perkins,I do.
Leslie Knope,"Suspect laughing with friends and playing with his stupid skateboard in a snide, turdish manner."
Dave Sanderson,Turdish?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Like a turd.
Leslie Knope,Like a little turd.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, listen, your scare tactics clearly worked."
Dave Sanderson,You got Andy guarding the statue.
Dave Sanderson,Why don't we go to Ann's party?
Dave Sanderson,Have a little fun.
Dave Sanderson,Oh.
Dave Sanderson,Uh... We wanted to cover that block anyway.
Dave Sanderson,"Wanted a police presence on it, so, this is within the bound, confines of…"
Leslie Knope,"Sure, let's go."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We'll go by my office and pick up my costume.
Dave Sanderson,Got it.
Leslie Knope,Can't we just fire a warning shot over his head as we drive by?
Dave Sanderson,"No, babe."
Dave Sanderson,Don't touch that.
Leslie Knope,Leaving location.
Leslie Knope,Look at stupid suspect.
Leslie Knope,I hate suspect.
Leslie Knope,Where are my keys?
Dave Sanderson,Looks like it's open.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Dave Sanderson,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Pikitis!
Dave Sanderson,We've been tailing that kid for a couple of hours.
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, it must have been somebody else."
Leslie Knope,It was Pikitis.
Leslie Knope,Believe me now?
Dave Sanderson,That doesn't mean anything to me.
Leslie Knope,This is a peach pit.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,He was eating a peach when I went to go talk to him.
Dave Sanderson,Mmmhmm?
Leslie Knope,This is his ace of spades.
Leslie Knope,This is his calling card.
Leslie Knope,This is what he leaves all his victims.
Leslie Knope,And it's still warm.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go and arrest him."
Leslie Knope,And send this to the lab.
Dave Sanderson,We don't have a lab.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, April."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you're underage."
April Ludgate,You're not.
Dr. Harris,Hey.
Dr. Harris,"Yeah, I'm gonna leave."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Dr. Harris,This isn't that fun.
Ann Perkins,Didn't need to tell me that.
Dr. Harris,I'm gonna take this home.
Dr. Harris,"Nobody was drinking it, so I'm gonna take it."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Dr. Harris,"Gonna take this, too."
Dr. Harris,Been meaning to read it.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, this isn't strictly legal."
Dave Sanderson,"We can talk to him for maybe an hour, and then I gotta let him go."
Leslie Knope,You talk to him first.
Leslie Knope,You have a scary face.
Dave Sanderson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"No, in a good way."
Leslie Knope,Scary cute.
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Go talk to him.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Greg Pikitis,"I didn't do this, man."
Greg Pikitis,I promise.
Dave Sanderson,"Now, son, I'm a police officer."
Dave Sanderson,Okay?
Dave Sanderson,You shouldn't lie to me.
Greg Pikitis,I'm not.
Greg Pikitis,I've never been here before.
Greg Pikitis,And why would I do this?
Dave Sanderson,Because you've had runins with Miss Knope in the past.
Dave Sanderson,Just a second.
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Ask him about the peach pit.
Greg Pikitis,"This isn't one way glass, you know."
Greg Pikitis,I can see you.
Greg Pikitis,"You know, I like Knope."
Greg Pikitis,"I screw with her 'cause she gets all riled up, and her face gets all scrunched up like this."
Greg Pikitis,But I like her.
Greg Pikitis,She's all right.
Greg Pikitis,You see?
Leslie Knope,What?
Ann Perkins,"I spent the whole day decorating this place, and everybody's in the kitchen."
Ann Perkins,Why is everyone always in the kitchen?
Mark Brendanawicz,I think it's going fine.
Ann Perkins,It's so quiet.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,This is a total failure.
Ann Perkins,This party is a failure.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's not a failure, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Come on.
Ron Swanson,"Ann, do you have any Mounds?"
Ron Swanson,Because all I can find are Almond Joys.
Ron Swanson,And almonds give me the squirts.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I'm here."
Andy Dwyer,Statue's fine.
Andy Dwyer,"""Crappy Hallowieners."""
Andy Dwyer,That's hilarious.
Andy Dwyer,Where's the kid?
Leslie Knope,In the conference room.
Leslie Knope,Trying to hide his obvious guilt.
Dave Sanderson,"Leslie, I don't know what to tell you."
Dave Sanderson,I don't think he did it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he did."
Leslie Knope,And we need a confession.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Andy and I are going to take a walk.
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be just you, Pikitis, and these pliers."
Dave Sanderson,"Look, I'm not gonna torture this kid."
Leslie Knope,Nobody said torture.
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you let me take a run at him, boss?"
Andy Dwyer,"In order to think like one of these guys, you have to think like them."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He's never seen you before.
Leslie Knope,So imply that you're someone very important and that you can make his life hell.
Andy Dwyer,Greg Pikitis?
Andy Dwyer,Would you like some boiling hot coffee in your face?
Andy Dwyer,My name is Bert Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,I'm with the [bleep] FBI.
Ron Swanson,Ooh.
Ron Swanson,Are these the same kind of chips?
Tom Haverford,Ann!
Tom Haverford,"What's up, gorgeous!"
Ann Perkins,Perfect.
Tom Haverford,"Get your Raggedy ass over here, girl."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Tom."
Ann Perkins,Mad Hatter?
Tom Haverford,"T Pain, baby!"
Tom Haverford,"She poppin', she rollin', she rollin' She climbin' that pole and I'm in love with a stripper"
Tom Haverford,This is not a stripper.
Tom Haverford,"It's my wife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,You remember her?
Wendy,Hi.
Wendy,Thank you so much for inviting us.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, hi."
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Tom Haverford,"She's a surgeon at County General, and she's super hot."
Ann Perkins,"Well, thank you for being a doctor and not coming dressed as a doctor."
Wendy,"Oh, my God."
Wendy,Who'd be boring enough to do that?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, what happened here?"
Tom Haverford,Did you tell everyone they're gonna have to get a bone marrow transplant tomorrow?
Tom Haverford,They look miserable.
Tom Haverford,This party's a disaster.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, it's not."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, it is."
Tom Haverford,Don't worry about it.
Tom Haverford,We can fix this.
Wendy,Totally.
Tom Haverford,Give us a second.
Leslie Knope,Looks like Andy's wearing him down.
Andy Dwyer,Shut up!
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go finish him off.
Greg Pikitis,That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you just shut up for a second?
Leslie Knope,What's going on in here?
Andy Dwyer,He's a jerk.
Andy Dwyer,He's being such a jerk.
Andy Dwyer,That's an awful thing to say to a human being!
Greg Pikitis,Are you crying?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I am not crying, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm allergic to jerks!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, out."
Andy Dwyer,"Fine, and I don't even care!"
Andy Dwyer,It's stupid--
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,The gloves are coming off.
Greg Pikitis,What's that?
Leslie Knope,I think you know what that is.
Leslie Knope,"When I came to visit you at the school, you were eating a peach."
Leslie Knope,"Then my office gets vandalized, and somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk?"
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a coincidence, Greg."
Greg Pikitis,"Wow, you nailed me."
Greg Pikitis,"I mean, there's no way that two different people could have eaten the same fruit in the same day, in the same area of Indiana."
Greg Pikitis,Never mind that I was actually eating a plum when you saw me earlier.
Leslie Knope,I know you did this.
Leslie Knope,I don't care what you say.
Leslie Knope,I don't care that you were in the parking lot all night.
Leslie Knope,Somehow you found a way to get in here--
Greg Pikitis,"Wait, wait, wait."
Greg Pikitis,How did you know that I was in the parking lot all night?
Leslie Knope,"Because I followed you, genius!"
Greg Pikitis,If you followed me all night then you know that it wasn't me.
Greg Pikitis,"Knope, what is your problem?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have been very civil."
Leslie Knope,But I will waterboard you.
Dave Sanderson,"No, nope."
Dave Sanderson,I don't think she would make a good cop.
Dave Sanderson,"I would be frightened to live in a town that she's the cop of, frankly."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, do you want me to liven things up or not?"
Ann Perkins,Course I do.
Tom Haverford,"All right, then relax."
Tom Haverford,And turn off all the lights that don't have colored bulbs.
Tom Haverford,"All right, y'all!"
Tom Haverford,Take the pigs in the blanket and put them to sleep!
Tom Haverford,It's time to get wild!
Tom Haverford,"Get this furniture out of here, y'all, we're making a dance floor."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, y'all."
Tom Haverford,Put the turkey wraps down.
Tom Haverford,We're about to get wild.
Tom Haverford,"Ron Swanson's in the building, y'all!"
Leslie Knope,His mom's gonna be here soon.
Leslie Knope,"Please, Dave, just arrest him."
Dave Sanderson,On what charge?
Leslie Knope,Just handcuff him to something.
Greg's Mom,Greggy?
Greg's Mom,Greg!
Greg's Mom,Gregsy!
Greg Pikitis,Mom!
Leslie Knope,Mrs. Pikitis?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, this is Officer Sanderson."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Greg's Mom,What the hell do you think you're doing?
Greg's Mom,You can't just hold a 16 year old kid against his will.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, we were trying to question him about this vandalism."
Greg's Mom,Do you have any evidence?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson,We don't.
Leslie Knope,"Two words, peach pit."
Greg's Mom,Peach pit?
Leslie Knope,"His DNA is all over it, I assume."
Dave Sanderson,We don't know that.
Leslie Knope,We can get it tested.
Dave Sanderson,We can't.
Leslie Knope,"And if it matches your DNA, then you're going away for a long time."
Dave Sanderson,It won't.
Greg's Mom,Is this a joke?
Leslie Knope,No.
Greg's Mom,I'm calling your shift commander.
Greg's Mom,"Monday morning, I am calling your boss."
Greg's Mom,I don't know who to call about you--
Andy Dwyer,The President of the United States of America.
Greg's Mom,Fine.
Greg's Mom,"And if any of you ever come near my son again, I swear to God I will sue you and everyone in this building."
Greg's Mom,"Come on, honey."
Leslie Knope,Let them think they've lost us.
Leslie Knope,Then we're--
Leslie Knope,Where are you going?
Dave Sanderson,I gotta go tell my boss why I illegally detained a teenager.
Dave Sanderson,I shouldn't have gotten involved with this.
Dave Sanderson,It's just... It's just bad police work.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it was bad FBI work, too."
Andy Dwyer,My bad.
Tom Haverford,"Tonight, the ""T"" in T-Pain stands for Tom Haverford!"
Tom Haverford,Nurses versus doctors.
Tom Haverford,"On my mark, three, two, one."
Tom Haverford,Go!
Tom Haverford,Vodka!
All,Go!
Ron Swanson,Son.
Ron Swanson,That is one hell of a costume.
Ben,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, that's good."
Ron Swanson,Nice party.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Why would anyone do this?
Andy Dwyer,Kids are kids.
Andy Dwyer,Everybody does stupid stuff like this in high school.
Leslie Knope,I didn't.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but you were probably a nerd, though, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I mean that in a good way."
Andy Dwyer,Look at you now.
Andy Dwyer,You're the coolest person I've ever met.
Andy Dwyer,I even met John Cougar Mellencamp once.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, why don't you go home?"
Leslie Knope,I'll finish cleaning this up.
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you got me a job and you're helping me turn my life around."
Andy Dwyer,I go home when you go home.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, it's city planning."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mostly like regulating things and just making sure people obey the city code.
Nurse,You wanna get out of here?
Nurse,Go back to my place?
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm dating Ann.
Nurse,Good.
Nurse,That was a test.
Nurse, You passed.
Nurse," Let's celebrate you passing the test, over a drink, at my place."
Mark Brendanawicz, No.
Mark Brendanawicz, Still no.
Nurse, You passed the second test.
Nurse, But we're still watching you.
Nurse," So, you wanna get out of here, go back to my place?"
Wendy,Hey.
Wendy, Ron.
Ron Swanson," Hello, Wendy."
Ron Swanson," Well, you and Tom really turned the party around."
Wendy, We have a good time together.
Wendy, Tom told me that you know about our green card marriage.
Wendy, And I just want to say thank you for not telling anyone.
Ron Swanson, No worries.
Ron Swanson, I'd hate for you to have to go back to Canada.
Ron Swanson, All that socialized medicine up there.
Tom Haverford, Wendylicious.
Tom Haverford, Where have you been?
Wendy,I was just thanking Ron.
Wendy," For, you know, not telling anyone."
Tom Haverford," Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford, Thank you.
Tom Haverford, That was cool of you.
Wendy," You know, you won't have to keep it a secret much longer, because in a few months we can split up without raising any eyebrows."
Wendy, And we'll invite you to the divorce party.
Leslie Knope," Huh, maybe Greg is innocent."
Leslie Knope," If that's the case, then there's another kid out there who's tormenting me."
Andy Dwyer, Maybe.
Leslie Knope, I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country.
Leslie Knope, That's the cornerstone of democracy.
Andy Dwyer, Sure.
Leslie Knope," On the other hand, Greg Pikitis is a little punk."
Leslie Knope, And I kind of wanna TP his house.
Andy Dwyer, Let's do it.
Leslie Knope," Wait, wait! Wait, wait! This is fun! This is fun! What do I do?"
Andy Dwyer,"You just grab the toilet paper, unroll it a little bit like this, and throw it on the tree."
Leslie Knope, This is for Mayor Percy! This is for the Parks Department office! This is for pooping on the handball court!
Leslie Knope,Yeah! This is really fun! But I don't condone it!
Ann Perkins,"Bye, guys."
Mark Brendanawicz, Bye.
Ann Perkins," You're the man, Swanson."
Ann Perkins, Thanks for coming.
Tom Haverford, Ann!
Ann Perkins,Dude.
Ann Perkins, Thank you so much.
Ann Perkins, I don't even know what to say.
Tom Haverford, Don't mention it.
Mark Brendanawicz," Also, Tom, your wife is super cool."
Mark Brendanawicz," So, well done."
Tom Haverford," Yeah, she's pretty great, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins," I don't know how you landed that chick, but she's awesome."
Ann Perkins, Nice work.
Ann Perkins, You're lucky.
Wendy," Hi, you ready to go?"
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Wendy, All right.
Wendy, Thank you so much.
Wendy, We had so much fun.
Ann Perkins," Bye, thank you."
Tom Haverford, About to head home and have crazy sex.
Ann Perkins, That's cool.
Ann Perkins, I don't--
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Five-O! Five-O!
Andy Dwyer,"I see you in there, Andy."
Andy Dwyer, Leslie? What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Greg's Mom," That's them, Officer! Right there!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope," Oh, no."
Leslie Knope," I'm so sorry, I think we have the wrong house."
Greg's Mom, Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,"It's really hard to explain, but we were trying to get revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and we thought this was his house, but I guess we got the address wrong."
Greg's Mom, I'm Greg's mom.
Leslie Knope, You are?
Greg's Mom,Yes.
Greg's Mom, Oh.
Greg's Mom," Did he hire a fake mom again, to get him out of trouble?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Greg's Mom,"Whenever he gets in trouble, he goes on Craigslist and hires a woman to play his mother and bail him out."
Greg's Mom," Oh, that little SOB! Greg! Gregory!"
Leslie Knope,I knew it!
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer, Dude.
Andy Dwyer, That kid is amazing.
Greg's Mom, He's not in his room.
Greg's Mom, I don't know where he is.
Leslie Knope, I do.
Leslie Knope, Make sure you--
Extra,"I need more, man."
Dave Sanderson, Hey!
Leslie Knope,Let them go! Stay on the leader!
Greg's Mom,I am gonna wring your neck!
Leslie Knope,How did you get into the Parks Department? I have to know.
Greg Pikitis, Maybe the FBI can figure it out.
Andy Dwyer," I'm not even in the FBI, stupid."
Greg Pikitis," Wow, you're amazing."
Leslie Knope, Hey! You're going to jail for a very long time.
Greg Pikitis, You can't--
Dave Sanderson,"He's not gonna go to jail, you know."
Dave Sanderson, He's a minor.
Leslie Knope," Well, we'll let the jury decide."
Dave Sanderson, There's not gonna be a jury--
Leslie Knope,Then the judge will decide where he goes.
Dave Sanderson, Look.
Dave Sanderson," He's going to do probation, he's a minor."
Leslie Knope," Dave, just let me have this."
Mark Brendanawicz, Wow.
Mark Brendanawicz," Nice work, Knope."
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, That is amazing.
Leslie Knope, Thanks.
Leslie Knope," But the thing that's driving me nuts is, how did he do it?"
Ann Perkins,"If you destroy him early, please come by."
Leslie Knope, I will.
Ann Perkins, How is someone gonna be able to get through that door?
Jerry Gergich,Oh! What the... Are you
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we were here all afternoon."
Leslie Knope," How did he get in? First of all, we always lock the doors when we leave."
Leslie Knope, And Dave and I tailed Pikitis from the moment he left his house at 7:00 p.m.  to the moment we came back here.
Leslie Knope," Does he have a lookalike or something? Did he have an accomplice? I mean, did he have help? How did that little turd do it?   "

Ron Swanson,"""Thank you, Old Gus, for brightening our lives, our hearts, and most importantly, our shoes."""
Leslie Knope,This truly is a day of mixed emotions for me.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sad that Old Gus is leaving, but it allows me to help Andy restart his life as Pioneer Hall's new shoeshine guy."
Old Gus,"Well, I've been listening to your boring speeches for the last 50 years, and now it's time for you to listen to one of mine."
Old Gus,"You know, a day like this makes a man reflect upon his life, and I've come to the conclusion that I've completely wasted mine."
Old Gus,"And just for the record, I never ever liked being called ""Old Gus."""
Old Gus,"I didn't understand it when I was in my 20s, and I sure hate it now."
Old Gus,"So go to hell, every single one of you."
Old Gus,"Screw Pawnee, and screw your damn shoes."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,That's classic.
Leslie Knope,"So, I propose that we change our name from the Subcommittee for Pit Beautification to the Subcommittee for Lot Beautification."
Leslie Knope,"April, stop that."
Leslie Knope,Who are you texting?
April Ludgate,You.
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Leslie Knope,She's texting me.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry you're bored.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, hey, everyone."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge."
Leslie Knope,Keep the momentum going.
Leslie Knope,Keep these minds working.
Tom Haverford,"Absolutely, chief."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Would you rather be able to fly, or speak fluent French?"
Tom Haverford,"Donna, go."
Donna Meagle,French.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't wanna freak you out, but another department filed a planning claim for Lot 48."
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,The library?
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope,"They're like a biker gang, but instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's gonna be okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's not a done deal.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for pulling me out of there.
Leslie Knope,"I need a good plan, though."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I don't wanna cause a panic."
Leslie Knope,"News flash, we're screwed."
Leslie Knope,We got a big problem with the library.
Tom Haverford,Punkass book jockeys.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,Why do we hate the library?
Leslie Knope,The library is the worst group of people ever assembled in history.
Leslie Knope,"They're mean, conniving, rude, and extremely well read, which makes them very dangerous."
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to steal Lot 48 for a new branch.
All,What?
Donna Meagle,Get out of here.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,On 48?
Ann Perkins,I actually think a library would be nice that close to my house.
April Ludgate,Let's bring the library down.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,But I'm not about to say that in there.
Tom Haverford,A new branch?
Leslie Knope,Jerks.
Jerry Gergich,You're kidding.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I hate them."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We need to make contact with someone there.
Leslie Knope,Does anybody know anybody that works at the library?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, we actually kind of do."
Mark Brendanawicz,The new Deputy Director of the department is Tammy Swanson.
Leslie Knope,Ron's ex-wife?
Leslie Knope,That's terrific.
Leslie Knope,Or is that awful?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he hates her, but he knows her."
Leslie Knope,Everything's okay.
Leslie Knope,Or is it just the same?
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you're thinking out loud again."
Leslie Knope,Am I?
Leslie Knope,I am.
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,That bitch of an ex-wife is working for the library now.
Ron Swanson,That is perfect.
Ron Swanson,The worst person in the world working at the worst place in the world.
Leslie Knope,I have to go talk to her.
Leslie Knope,And you got to give me something I can use.
Leslie Knope,Does she have any weaknesses?
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, no?"
Leslie Knope,Everybody has a weakness.
Ron Swanson,Not machines.
Ron Swanson,I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.
Leslie Knope,I see.
Leslie Knope,"I knew that you had two ex-wives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and--"
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,I hate them both.
Ron Swanson,"On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my ex-wives rushed to my side, so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time."
Ron Swanson,Would I get married again?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, absolutely."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't believe in love, what's the point of living?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with Tammy about the relative merits of parks versus libraries.
Leslie Knope,"And in case something bad goes down, I wore my sharpest rings."
Leslie Knope,This one will tear you up.
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I called a little while ago.
Tammy 2,You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Tammy 2,"You have overdue book fees totaling 3 dollars, missy."
Leslie Knope,That is so typical.
Leslie Knope,"I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that."
Tammy 2,No--
Leslie Knope,That's why everybody hates the library.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,Here's your 3 dollars.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, no--"
Leslie Knope,And I'll see you in hell.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, Leslie, Leslie."
Tammy 2,I'm just kidding.
Tammy 2,"My gosh, I mean, you did have 3 dollars worth of fines, but I cleared them."
Tammy 2,"We government gals have to watch each other's backs, right?"
Leslie Knope,I know this is a trap.
Leslie Knope,But I don't know how.
Tammy 2,Okay.
Tammy 2,Did you talk to Ron?
Tammy 2,Ron tends to exaggerate when it comes to me.
Tammy 2,I swear I don't have cloven feet.
Tammy 2,Please.
Tammy 2,Sit down.
Andy Dwyer,"Shine, shine, shine your shoes."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say, sir?"
Andy Dwyer,Ma'am?
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine?
Andy Dwyer,I won't look up your skirt.
Andy Dwyer,Ann.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,Crazy.
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,It's me.
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"So, Ann, how you been?"
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Leslie told me you were working here now."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I just joined the rat race."
Andy Dwyer,Chasing the cheese.
Andy Dwyer,"Racing the rats, trying to get the cheese."
Andy Dwyer,Enough technical business talk.
Andy Dwyer,You look ravishing.
Ann Perkins,"Not a lot of customers, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, business is a little slow."
Andy Dwyer,It is definitely due to the economy.
Andy Dwyer,I've been hearing a lot of people say that a lot about a lot of stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,You want those shoes shined?
Andy Dwyer,I'll give you a discount because you're a friend of Ann's.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I'm more than a friend of Ann's."
Andy Dwyer,Not for long.
Mark Brendanawicz,Sorry?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,At least he finally has a real job.
Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, the only job he had was sending audition tapes to Survivor and Deal or No Deal."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer, and I would be a perfect contestant for Deal or No Deal."
Leslie Knope,"I want it to be a perfect park with a state-of-the-art swing set, and basketball courts, and off to the side, a lovely sitting area for kids with asthma to watch other kids play."
Tammy 2,Wow.
Tammy 2,"If I'd had a park like that when I was growing up, I probably wouldn't have gone through such a prolonged mall slut phase."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the goal, Tammy."
Tammy 2,"Listen, you guys got there first."
Tammy 2,"I'm gonna withdraw my request for the lot, as a professional courtesy to you."
Tammy 2,"Government gals, right?"
Leslie Knope,Government gals.
Ron Swanson,So you talked to Tammy?
Ron Swanson,What's it like to stare into the eye of Satan's butthole?
Leslie Knope,"She's changed, Ron."
Leslie Knope,She's a different person.
Leslie Knope,I think it would be healthy for you to get a sense of closure.
Leslie Knope,Look at Mark and me.
Leslie Knope,We slept together.
Leslie Knope,"We talked about it, we're still friends."
Ron Swanson,You slept with Brendanawicz?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,"Look, Tammy and I don't work."
Ron Swanson,We are oil and water.
Ron Swanson,"Or oil, and TNT, and C4, and a detonator, and a butane torch."
Ron Swanson,Nothing good will come... Wait.
Ron Swanson,"She's here, isn't she?"
Tammy 2,"Hi, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Good start.
Tammy 2,"I'm sorry about this, but I just really wanna talk to you."
Tammy 2,Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?
Ron Swanson,Let's get this over with.
Tammy 2,"Thanks, Ron."
Tammy 2,It means a lot.
Tammy 2,You're a miracle worker.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Do you know what you just did?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I got two people to put aside years of hostility and open a door to the possibility of friendship.
Donna Meagle,You were not here when Ron and Tammy got divorced.
Donna Meagle,I was.
Donna Meagle,Those two are crazy.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,And you just opened the gates to Crazytown.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I think Ron was acting like a baby, a little bit."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what is he afraid of?"
Leslie Knope,Tammy's just a woman.
Leslie Knope,A nice woman.
Leslie Knope,"You know, she's not a murderer."
Leslie Knope,She's not a dragon.
Tammy 2,"It's really good to see you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,You've aged horribly.
Tammy 2,You son of a bitch.
Ron Swanson,That didn't take long.
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God."
Tammy 2,What is your problem?
Tammy 2,"Nothing's changed, has it?"
Tammy 2,"Who set the bed on fire, huh?"
Waiter,"Excuse me, folks."
Ron Swanson,I did.
Ron Swanson,Okay?
Ron Swanson,Is that what you wanna hear?
Waiter,"Please, folks."
Ron Swanson,We're fine.
Ron Swanson,We're fine.
Tammy 2,Okay.
Tammy 2,I'm so sorry.
Waiter,Please.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Take it easy.
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"When you meddle in someone's personal life, it's just so rewarding."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God, yes."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Tammy 2,"Oh, wow."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Waiter,Sir.
Waiter,Ma'am.
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Tammy 2,"Oh, yes."
Tammy 2,Baby.
Tammy 2,Gun it.
Tammy 2,The usual place.
Ron Swanson,Have Gun Will Travel reads the card of a man A knight without armor in a savage land.
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,That is a beautiful sweater vest.
Ron Swanson,April.
Ron Swanson,You look like you could use 20 dollars.
Ron Swanson,Am I right?
April Ludgate,Why?
Ron Swanson,"'Cause you're a kid, and kids always need money."
Tom Haverford,I need money.
Ron Swanson,Ha!
Ron Swanson,"That's why you're my favorite, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"When Tiger Woods feels invincible, he wears a red shirt and black pants."
Ron Swanson,"Good morning, Deputy."
Tom Haverford,Ron wears the same thing after he's had sex.
Ron Swanson,I'm a simple man.
Ron Swanson,"I like pretty, dark haired women and breakfast food."
Ron Swanson,But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real.
Ron Swanson,"Today, I got the real thing."
Ron Swanson,A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning.
Ron Swanson,I should have taken a picture of it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Mark Brendanawicz,My girlfriend's ex is working 100 feet away from my desk and he's been pretty clear about wanting her back.
Mark Brendanawicz,What do I do with that?
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,That's a tough one.
Tom Haverford,"You should break up with her, and tell her to go out with me."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's good.
Mark Brendanawicz,Can I ask you another question?
Mark Brendanawicz,Why did I come to you for advice?
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"I think you should play this one cool, man."
Tom Haverford,Be the grown-up.
Tom Haverford,Take the high road.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Ann's a classy chick.
Tom Haverford,"If you get down in the mud, you're just gonna lose her respect."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You've just made a surprising amount of sense, Tom."
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,I've never taken the high road.
Tom Haverford,But I tell other people to.
Tom Haverford,'Cause then there's more room for me on the low road.
Leslie Knope,"So, how did your coffee with Tammy go?"
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I can't thank you enough for sticking your nose where it didn't belong."
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,So what did you guys talk about?
Leslie Knope,Old times?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love talking about old times."
Leslie Knope,"New times are great, too, but there's just something about old times, you know what I mean?"
Ron Swanson,We didn't talk.
Ron Swanson,We made love.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, spare me the details."
Leslie Knope,I'm just happy.
Ron Swanson,"It was so intense, I didn't know where my flesh stopped and hers began."
Ron Swanson,You know what I mean?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"Our marriage was always a complete disaster, but we did have that."
Ron Swanson,The two of us.
Ron Swanson,"It's like doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours."
Leslie Knope,"This seems like a private matter, but I'm so--"
Ron Swanson,That woman really knows her way around a penis.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm happy that it went well and that you enjoyed your coffee."
Leslie Knope,I truly believe that everyone should be friends with their exes.
Leslie Knope,I can't even tell you how many of my exes' weddings I've been to.
Tom Haverford,They're reading their old divorce papers.
Tammy 2,"""Three fistfuls of hair."""
Tammy 2,That's not even possible.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm too classy to say ""I told you so,"" Donna."
Leslie Knope,So I wrote it on a Post-it.
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you take the rest of the day off?
Ron Swanson,"I mean, you spend so much time worrying about this park, but really, who cares?"
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,I care a lot.
Leslie Knope,"It's kind of my thing, remember?"
Ron Swanson,"But at the end of the day, what does it matter if the lot becomes a park, or a museum, or a megachurch?"
Leslie Knope,Or a library.
Ron Swanson,"Nobody said ""library."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, have you been talking to Tammy about the lot?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I swear on a grave.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, tell me the truth."
Leslie Knope,Are you giving her the lot?
Ron Swanson,Not giving.
Ron Swanson,We have discussed a trade.
Leslie Knope,For what?
Ron Swanson,More…
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Ron Swanson,More sex.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, can I speak with you for a second?"
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You don't care about Ron.
Leslie Knope,You're just using him to get Lot 48 for your library.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, that's crazy."
Tammy 2,And correct.
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Tammy 2,"Les, there are two kinds of women in this world."
Tammy 2,There are women who work hard and stress out about doing the right thing.
Tammy 2,And then there are women who are cool.
Tammy 2,You could either be a Cleopatra or you could be an Eleanor Roosevelt.
Tammy 2,I'd rather be Cleopatra.
Leslie Knope,What kind of lunatic would wanna be Cleopatra over Eleanor Roosevelt?
Tammy 2,Haven't you ever messed with a man's head just to see what you could get him to do for you?
Tammy 2,We do it all the time in the Library Department.
Tammy 2,You should come join us sometime.
Leslie Knope,I would never work at the Library Department.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna tell Ron what you just said, and this little game that you're playing is gonna be over."
Tammy 2,Okey-doke.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you better run."
Leslie Knope,We're no longer government gals.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, no."
Leslie Knope,The Planning Department Reprioritization Document?
Ron Swanson,"Calm down, I haven't signed it yet."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, you're going to."
Leslie Knope,"Because Tammy wants you to, and you do everything that she wants."
Ron Swanson,She made some really good points about libraries.
Leslie Knope,Are you even listening to yourself?
Leslie Knope,You're defending the library now?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, the library?"
Leslie Knope,"Of all the horrifying, miserable things in the world?"
Ron Swanson,Some people like libraries.
Leslie Knope,I can't even believe what I'm hearing.
Leslie Knope,"""Some people like libraries."""
Leslie Knope,"Ron, she's in your head."
Leslie Knope,"You said that she was a manipulative monster, and you were right."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Tammy's changed.
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye and tell me that she's changed.
Leslie Knope,Look me in the eye.
Ron Swanson,"I'm so screwed, Knope."
Ron Swanson,Her hooks are in my brain.
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Ron Swanson,She has all the power and I have nothing.
Ron Swanson,I'm so little.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you just break up with her?
Ron Swanson,I don't think I can.
Ron Swanson,"We would just end up naked, and I'd give her your lot, and my house, and God knows what else."
Ron Swanson,I have no control over my actions.
Ron Swanson,It's like she's crawled up inside of me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Ron, I don't wanna hear about your disgusting sex anymore."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Now sack up.
Leslie Knope,You are Ron freaking Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Not around her, I'm not."
Ron Swanson,"It took years of intense, focused hatred to get over her, and now I've undone all that great work."
Ron Swanson,You've got to help me break up with her.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I should get involved in this.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, now you don't wanna get involved?"
Ron Swanson,"""It's just coffee, Ron."""
Ron Swanson,"""She's changed, Ron."""
Ron Swanson,"""I let Mark nail me and we're still friends."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I would never use those words.
Leslie Knope,I never said-- Point taken.
Leslie Knope,Let's go dump your ex.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"So, would you like to be in the room when I tell her it's over, or would you rather wait outside?"
Ron Swanson,In the room.
Ron Swanson,I don't want her to think I'm a wimp.
Leslie Knope,Here are the ground rules.
Leslie Knope,Don't talk to her.
Leslie Knope,Do not make eye contact with her.
Leslie Knope,Don't believe anything she says.
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, like a potted plant."
Leslie Knope,Can you do that?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you have any--
Andy Dwyer,Mark.
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Donna.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, how's the shoeshine game?"
Andy Dwyer,"I'm on a break, one of the many advantages of owning your own business."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know that's not your situation, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, Donna."
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Quick question.
Andy Dwyer,Ann is trying to decide between Mark and myself.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, she's not."
Andy Dwyer,"If you had to choose, who would you choose?"
Andy Dwyer,"Right now, on the spot."
Donna Meagle,I'm not sure.
Donna Meagle,Why don't you spin around for me?
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,Can we talk privately?
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Mark Brendanawicz,Just out here.
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tammy, for that and many other reasons, Ron has decided to end this relationship."
Tammy 2,Wait a minute.
Tammy 2,Ron brought you here to break up with me for him?
Ron Swanson,She volunteered.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, Ron doesn't wanna break up with me."
Tammy 2," What Ron wants to do is leave here right now, go to the sleaziest motel in town, and wrap himself around me like a coiled snake."
Leslie Knope," No, he doesn't."
Tammy 2, I'm pretty sure he does.
Leslie Knope, See?
Leslie Knope,He's completely over you.
Mark Brendanawicz," Look, I understand that this Ann situation is awkward."
Mark Brendanawicz, But I like you a lot as a dude.
Mark Brendanawicz," And I just hope that there is some way that we can both be mature, and maybe be friends."
Andy Dwyer, Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, I doubt it.
Andy Dwyer," I mean, I think you're a cool dude, too."
Andy Dwyer, I like you as well.
Andy Dwyer, But I'm still in love with Ann.
Andy Dwyer, I couldn't have been more upfront about that.
Mark Brendanawicz, Is punching allowed on the high road?
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ron Swanson, She wins.
Ron Swanson, I can't resist her.
Leslie Knope," God, Ron, you have to."
Tammy 2, Stay out of this.
Tammy 2, This is our relationship.
Tammy 2, He's my man.
Tammy 2, And we have something twisted and beautiful.
Tammy 2, Oh.
Tammy 2, You want Ron.
Tammy 2, That's what this is all about.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, That's insane.
Leslie Knope," Fine, I had one dream."
Leslie Knope," But no, no."
Tammy 2," Baby, don't you see what's happening here? She's manipulating you because she's jealous of me, and the things I get to do to your body and face."
Leslie Knope," I'm here because Ron is my friend, and I don't like seeing my friends miserable."
Leslie Knope," And you, Tammy, you make him miserable."
Leslie Knope," So, Ron, you can give her the lot, or don't, whatever."
Leslie Knope," Just, please, find a way to be happy."
Ron Swanson, Knope.
Ron Swanson, Wait.
Leslie Knope," Ron, it's okay."
Leslie Knope, Just sign the thing.
Ron Swanson," No, Leslie, it's not okay."
Ron Swanson, You just put my needs in front of your own.
Ron Swanson, No woman has ever done that for me before.
Leslie Knope, I'm sure that's not true.
Ron Swanson," You see the kind of women that I choose, right? Look, just wait for me downstairs."
Ron Swanson," If I'm not down in five minutes, it's only because I'm receiving a pleasure so intense--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins," What the hell are you doing? ""Andy and Ann's Family Shoeshine""?"
Andy Dwyer,"Andy, Ann, I thought it had a nice ring to it."
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins," Look, Mark has been really cool about all this, and you're throwing it in his face."
Andy Dwyer," Look, I still have feelings for you."
Andy Dwyer, Okay? I said it.
Andy Dwyer, What do you want me to do? Not mention those feelings to your boyfriend?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz, Yes.
Mark Brendanawicz, And you might wanna take these pictures down.
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins, Take those pictures down.
Andy Dwyer, What? Fine.
Ann Perkins,All of it.
Andy Dwyer, I'm gonna.
Ann Perkins, Now.
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins, Give me the bikini one.
Andy Dwyer, The teeny one?
Ann Perkins,Bikini one.
Leslie Knope, You didn't give her the lot.
Ron Swanson, Let's get out of here.
Leslie Knope, Is part of your mustache missing?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson, Just keep walking.
Leslie Knope, There's a push-pin in your face.
Ron Swanson, Leave it in.
Ron Swanson, Can't you walk faster?
Leslie Knope,My legs are shorter than yours.
Ron Swanson, Mmm.
Ron Swanson, We had a good run.
Leslie Knope, Thank you for saving my future park.
Leslie Knope, I know that must've been hard for you.
Leslie Knope," You didn't kill Tammy, did you?"
Ron Swanson,I'm afraid she can't be killed.
Ron Swanson, To exes.
Ron Swanson, May they always stay that way.
Ron Swanson, Tammy is a mean person.
Leslie Knope," Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope, You can do better than that.
Ron Swanson, She's a grade A bitch.
Leslie Knope, There we go.
Ron Swanson," Every time she laughs, an angel dies."
Ron Swanson, Even telemarketers avoid her.
Ron Swanson, Her birth was payback for the sins of man.
Ron Swanson, But you know the worst thing about her?
Leslie Knope,She works for the library.
Ron Swanson, She works for the library.

,Season: 2 Episode: 09
Paul,Okay.
Paul,"As everybody knows, The Spirit of Pawnee was defaced again last night."
Leslie Knope,What was it this time?
Paul,Chocolate pudding.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,That's new.
Leslie Knope,The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And it's very controversial.
Leslie Knope,"We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce."
Leslie Knope,Someone tried to stab it once.
Leslie Knope,We really need better security here.
Leslie Knope,"We also need better, less offensive history."
Paul,"So, the city council has decided that The Spirit of Pawnee should be changed to something just a little less horrifying."
Paul,"Now, since the murals were made by government employees back in the 1930s, we thought it might be fun if each department submitted a design for a new mural."
Paul,And you'll submit your concepts tomorrow afternoon.
Paul,"All righty, folks?"
Paul,Thank you very much.
Joe From Sewage,"Hey, Leslie."
Joe From Sewage,What's your design going to be?
Joe From Sewage,A tree?
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you work in Sewage."
Leslie Knope,Your department literally specializes in crap.
Leslie Knope,You really want to do this?
Joe From Sewage,I told you before.
Joe From Sewage,"""Crap"" is a slang term."
Joe From Sewage,And I don't like that term.
Joe From Sewage,"But at least we don't specialize in losing, like you guys."
Joe From Sewage,Sewage.
Joe From Sewage,Let's roll.
Tom Haverford,Damn!
Tom Haverford,How does Sewage always get the hottest interns?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever."
Leslie Knope,This could be our legacy.
Ann Perkins,I thought building a park on Lot 48 was going to be our legacy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you can have two legacies."
Leslie Knope,Look at Madonna.
Leslie Knope,"Great singer, amazing arms."
Tom Haverford,Look at O.J. Simpson.
Tom Haverford,"Heisman Trophy winner, Naked Gun."
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Donna Meagle,"No offense, Leslie, but I'm not an artist."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's not true, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I've seen your fingernails.
Donna Meagle,"Um, I pay someone to do this."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, shoot."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm ordering all of you to design a mural."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, only Ron can order the whole department to do something."
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Order them to do this.
Ron Swanson,Do whatever Leslie says.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, here are your supplies."
Leslie Knope,I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And make me a sketch.
Leslie Knope,And it needs to be breath-taking and moving and historical and better than every department.
Leslie Knope,And you have one hour.
Leslie Knope,Designers.
Leslie Knope,Make it work.
Leslie Knope,Tim Gunn.
Andy Dwyer,"You, my friend, are ready to go dancing."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, sir."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Next?
Ron Swanson,Andrew.
Ron Swanson,Looking good.
Ron Swanson,Business is booming.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, how about you?"
Andy Dwyer,Need a little dog waxing?
Andy Dwyer,"It's only 5 bucks, and I'll let you cut in front of this guy."
Kyle,What?
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Beat it.
Andy Dwyer,This is Ron Swanson we're talking about.
Ron Swanson,I'm impressed with Andy.
Ron Swanson,Pulling himself up by his bootstraps.
Ron Swanson,He reminds me of me.
Ron Swanson,I got my first job when I was nine.
Ron Swanson,Worked at a sheet metal factory.
Ron Swanson,"In two weeks, I was running the floor."
Ron Swanson,Child labor laws are ruining this country.
Andy Dwyer,Do you have a key in your shoe?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"No, I have a bunion that's practically its own toe."
Ron Swanson,"Normally, the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors."
Ron Swanson,"But for these past three minutes, it's been reduced to a faint growl."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,That was neat.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, hey."
Andy Dwyer,We are all finished.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that was great."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, son."
Andy Dwyer,No sweat.
Andy Dwyer,Next?
Kyle,You shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
Kyle,It's not good business.
Andy Dwyer,You want to know what else isn't good business?
Andy Dwyer,That guy's my friend.
Kyle,Right.
Kyle,I'm saying you shouldn't let your friends cut in line.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry Kyle.
Andy Dwyer,Here.
Andy Dwyer,Give me this.
Andy Dwyer,Next.
Artist,"So, what are you looking for exactly?"
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, man."
Tom Haverford,"""The spirit of Pawnee."""
Tom Haverford,That's all I got.
Tom Haverford,Here.
Tom Haverford,Just give me 20 dollars worth of art.
Tom Haverford,"Just something that seems personal, that only I could have done."
Artist,Tell me about yourself.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Just paint.
Tom Haverford,I have no interest in art.
Tom Haverford,Let me clarify.
Tom Haverford,I have no interest in non-nude images.
Tom Haverford,"Dude, what the hell kind of art is this?"
Tom Haverford,It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles.
Artist,I'm an abstract expressionist.
Tom Haverford,"No, you're a con artist."
Tom Haverford,And I'm a guy that's out 20 bucks.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,Whatever.
Ann Perkins,I'm a terrible artist.
Ann Perkins,"But the Parks Department has done so much for me that if I can help them out in any way, I will."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,Maybe I should just give them all free flu shots.
Leslie Knope,I know everything about this town and these murals.
Leslie Knope,And that's why this is a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,Literally.
Leslie Knope,I have had a dream where I designed a mural.
Leslie Knope,"But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering."
Leslie Knope,"And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me."
Leslie Knope,"At one point, Gina Gershon was there."
April Ludgate,My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,"I never understood the term ""elbow grease."""
Andy Dwyer,I guess it's not really grease.
Andy Dwyer,Just hard work.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Nice, shiny shoes you got there."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hey."
Ron Swanson,"I was just, I think…"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,Shoot.
Ron Swanson,"Actually, it looks like I scuffed this one."
Andy Dwyer,"Do you need your money back, Ron?"
Andy Dwyer,Because I already spent it.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,How did... Never mind.
Ron Swanson,I think I'll just take another full polish.
Ron Swanson,Can I cut in line again?
Andy Dwyer,I feel right at home as a shoe shiner.
Andy Dwyer,"I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I'm doing it really, really well."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Let's get going with the spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go first."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Um... Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Well, since it's the Parks Department, I thought I would design a pretty park."
Ann Perkins,With dogs playing.
Ann Perkins,"And I can't really draw, so I just cut some stuff out of a magazine."
Tom Haverford,That looks like something a death row convict would make in art therapy.
Ann Perkins,"Dude, I tried."
Tom Haverford,And you failed.
Ann Perkins,It's dogs and people playing in a park.
Ann Perkins,It's cute.
Tom Haverford,"It's okay, sweetheart."
Tom Haverford,"You can't make art, because you are art."
Tom Haverford,You're beautiful.
Tom Haverford,But that sucks.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Let's see yours.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Mine is amazing.
Tom Haverford,It's going to blow your mind.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,This is some professional-ass art right here.
Leslie Knope,I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at.
Tom Haverford,"It's abstract, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"Over here, you've got some shapes."
Tom Haverford,"And then you come over to this side... You know, it's actually kind of interesting."
Tom Haverford,Each shape is its own thing.
Tom Haverford,"But then when it comes together, it really gives you a sense of... completion."
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,A piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction.
Tom Haverford,Is that normal?
Donna Meagle,"So, it's the Last Supper, but with famous people from Indiana."
Donna Meagle,"John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, uh, David Letterman, Vivica A. Fox."
Donna Meagle,"Okay, so, here's where it gets a little dicey."
Donna Meagle,Because there's not that many celebrities from Indiana.
Donna Meagle,"So, a NASCAR."
Donna Meagle,"Uh, my friend, Becky."
Donna Meagle,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,Who's the Jesus?
Donna Meagle,That would be Greg Kinnear.
Leslie Knope,I didn't know he was from Indiana.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you know, I read that he was."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he was great on ER."
Tom Haverford,Greg Kinnear wasn't in ER.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, he was."
Ann Perkins,I don't think that he was.
Leslie Knope,Who am I thinking of?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Next?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Really good, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,"For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma."
Tom Haverford,"You said ""murinal."""
Jerry Gergich,"She... No, I didn't."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did."
Ann Perkins,"You said ""murinal."""
Ann Perkins,I heard it.
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, she--"
April Ludgate,Jerry.
April Ludgate,Why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?
Tom Haverford,Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Go to the doctor.
Tom Haverford,You might have a murinary tract infection.
Jerry Gergich,I just wanted to show you my art.
Tom Haverford,Murinal!
Tom Haverford,Murinal!
Tom Haverford,Murinal!
Leslie Knope,Disqualified!
Jerry Gergich,It's pointillism.
Jerry Gergich,And each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town.
Tom Haverford,No one cares.
Tom Haverford,At all.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"So, this is a multimedia project."
April Ludgate,"First, a bunch of rats made out of garbage."
April Ludgate,And this is a TV screen.
April Ludgate,"It'll be like a big, flatscreen TV, and it will play looped video of knee surgeries."
April Ludgate,And then this is a human-sized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one.
April Ludgate,"And it will be spinning and there will be, like, a fat guy in it all the time, like, screaming and, like, eating raw beef and, like, bleeding."
April Ludgate,"And, like, blood will, like, come out of his mouth and stuff."
April Ludgate,"And that'll be, like, right next to the mural."
Leslie Knope,I have one question.
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,"If you have to ask, you don't get it."
Leslie Knope,I don't think they really got the assignment.
Leslie Knope,"If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time."
Leslie Knope,Like the Mona Lisa.
Leslie Knope,Or the music of Squeeze.
Leslie Knope,"June 8, 1922."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.
Leslie Knope,We lost a lot of good bread that day.
Leslie Knope,As well as several human lives.
Leslie Knope,And it also made the whole town smell like toast.
Leslie Knope,"Which one resident described as ""disturbingly enticing."""
Leslie Knope,But I digress.
Leslie Knope,The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.
Tom Haverford,Why would you want a mural that shows people dying when you could have shapes that come alive?
Leslie Knope,"Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history."
Leslie Knope,And people love voting for tragedy.
Leslie Knope,Look at the Oscars.
Leslie Knope,This is our Holocaust movie.
Leslie Knope,"This is our ""English Patient."""
Ann Perkins,It sounds like you're exploiting the tragedy.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ann gets it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Time to vote, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Cast your votes.
Leslie Knope,"May the best, most tragic project win."
Leslie Knope,"When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural."
Leslie Knope,And then those six voices came together as a team.
Leslie Knope,There are no losers today.
Leslie Knope,"But there is one winner, us."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, the results of the vote, please."
Tom Haverford,One to one to one to one to one to one.
Leslie Knope,"We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Third time today.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,That's a good shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,What the [bleep] man?
Ron Swanson,I I don't know what happened.
Ron Swanson,Frankly.
Ron Swanson,I emitted a noise.
Ron Swanson,The noise was involuntary.
Ron Swanson,"Sometimes, a sound is just a sound."
Ron Swanson,You know?
Leslie Knope,We need to whittle these down.
Leslie Knope,Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?
April Ludgate,Ann's blows.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Don't hold back.
April Ludgate,"No offense, but it's a giant picture of a park."
April Ludgate,That's not art.
Ann Perkins,"Well, at least it's not a fat human hamster eating meat."
April Ludgate,You don't even work here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you both have a point."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, yours was a little trite."
Leslie Knope,"And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"Look, there's something about those shapes."
Tom Haverford,There's some emotional art right there.
April Ludgate,Any kid could do that.
Tom Haverford,No kid could do that.
Tom Haverford,Only God could do that.
Donna Meagle,What is so great about the shapes?
Leslie Knope,"He likes the shapes, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And he's part of the team.
Leslie Knope,"So, here."
Leslie Knope,Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.
Leslie Knope,And then we'll put them on a new team mural.
Leslie Knope,We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.
Leslie Knope,It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.
Leslie Knope,Imagine how good that painting would be.
Leslie Knope,I think it's really good.
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Leslie Knope,Brendanawicz!
Leslie Knope,We need you for something.
Mark Brendanawicz,Can it wait?
Mark Brendanawicz,I am so swamped here.
Leslie Knope,Ann's in trouble.
Leslie Knope,We think it might be pills.
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,But this is just as important.
Leslie Knope,We need you to look at a piece of art.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, God."
Mark Brendanawicz,What is that?
Leslie Knope,This is our entry for the mural contest.
Leslie Knope,"We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you made a camel."
Mark Brendanawicz,You've never heard that saying?
Mark Brendanawicz,The camel was actually a horse designed by a committee.
Mark Brendanawicz,And what you guys have here is one ugly camel.
Mark Brendanawicz,Featuring Bill Paxton.
Donna Meagle,Greg Kinnear.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,Greg Kinnear.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?
Leslie Knope,You have to save us.
Leslie Knope,You have to design something.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, I'm not an artist."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you sketch things.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Uh, yeah, like poles for stop signs."
Leslie Knope,That everybody stops and looks at.
Mark Brendanawicz,"By law, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,They're required to.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Mark."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.
Leslie Knope,I know you'll do something good.
Leslie Knope,"And I really, really want to win this."
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,What are you going to do tonight?
Mark Brendanawicz,I was going to go to Arby's and watch Frontline.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, it is an old man feeding pigeons in a park."
Mark Brendanawicz,Uh... The spirit of Pawnee?
Mark Brendanawicz,Maybe?
Tom Haverford,You got to be kidding me.
Ann Perkins,How is that better than my park scene?
April Ludgate,It isn't.
April Ludgate,And that's saying something.
Donna Meagle,And who's the man?
Donna Meagle,Is he famous?
Donna Meagle,Is it Martin Landau?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Look, I have no dog in this fight."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm just saying that this will win.
Tom Haverford,It's nothing.
Tom Haverford,It's mush.
Tom Haverford,"There's not even one shape in there, Mark."
Tom Haverford,Where are the shapes?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not saying that this is any good.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm saying that this will win.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's mass appeal.
Mark Brendanawicz,"It's like what motels put up, and it hangs there for years, and no one ever throws acid at it."
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,Who did this?
Ron Swanson,I like it.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,I mean... Sorry.
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,It comforts me.
Ron Swanson,That'll win.
Tom Haverford,This is garbage.
Tom Haverford,We've got to go back to the shapes.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,This is boring.
April Ludgate,We got to go back to the garbage.
Ann Perkins,I would take the shapes over this.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, come on."
Donna Meagle,I wouldn't take the shapes over anything.
Donna Meagle,I'd take Jerry's murinal over this.
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Leslie Knope,This is the one.
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Mark's right.
Tom Haverford,This is an outrage.
Tom Haverford,Mark's not even in the department.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Mark Brendanawicz,Neither is Ann.
Tom Haverford,But Ann's hot.
Tom Haverford,And that counts for something.
April Ludgate,"Whatever happened to, ""We're the Parks Department!"""
April Ludgate,"""Rah rah rah!"""
April Ludgate,"""Down with the Sewage Department!"""
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we spent all day here for no reason."
Leslie Knope,We have a reason.
Leslie Knope,We're going to win.
Leslie Knope,That's our reason.
Leslie Knope,Our designs are not going to win.
Leslie Knope,Mark's might win.
Leslie Knope,"How great would it be if we won, you guys?"
Leslie Knope,"You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win."
Leslie Knope,We're going with this one.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"That is an order, team."
Leslie Knope,Go team!
Leslie Knope,Team dismissed.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are a team."
Leslie Knope,But I am the team leader.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made a bold decision."
Leslie Knope,We're playing it safe.
Joe From Sewage,"Hey, Knope."
Joe From Sewage,How's life in the Parks Defartment?
Leslie Knope,Better than life in the Sewage Defartment.
Leslie Knope,Which makes more sense.
Joe From Sewage,Whatever.
Joe From Sewage,You guys are screwed.
Joe From Sewage,Get used to this.
Joe From Sewage,Because it's going to be hanging on the wall right outside your door for the next 100 years.
Leslie Knope,That was pretty good.
Leslie Knope,You think they're going to win?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,They went super patriotic.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a classic mistake.
Mark Brendanawicz,"It seems crowd pleasing, but it's still a stance."
Mark Brendanawicz,"And in government, there's always someone who will oppose a stance."
Mark Brendanawicz,Us?
Mark Brendanawicz,Old man feeding pigeons?
Mark Brendanawicz,No stance.
Mark Brendanawicz,Absolutely no point of view whatsoever.
Leslie Knope,No point of view.
Leslie Knope,Smart.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I haven't been back.
Ron Swanson,I wish him good luck in his business.
Ron Swanson,"And yes, I will absolutely go back to get my shoes shined soon."
Ron Swanson,"I don't, frankly, see why this is a topic for discussion."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Ron Swanson,"Uh Andy, you know, the thing the other day?"
Andy Dwyer,"Other day, other day... Yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yesterday?"
Ron Swanson,I am... That... That... Was... I feel--
Andy Dwyer,"I'm okay-- You know, I'd be okay if we... I'd be okay if we never mentioned it again."
Ron Swanson,Never mention what again?
Andy Dwyer,"The moan, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,The weird moan you made.
Andy Dwyer, That was super weird.
Andy Dwyer, Do you not remember that? I talked about it with the lady who went after you for a half an hour.
Andy Dwyer, She said she thought it was an animal--
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson, It was just an odd moment.
Ron Swanson," Let's just, let's just not talk about it anymore."
Andy Dwyer, That's what I was trying to say.
Andy Dwyer," But, yeah."
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Ron Swanson, Okay.
Andy Dwyer, Good time.
Chief Konner, Ms. Knope.
Leslie Knope, Chief Konner.
Leslie Knope, What do you got there?
Chief Konner,"Well, we aren't really artists."
Chief Konner, But we gave it a shot.
Chief Konner," It's your basic dogs playing poker, but with an everything's on fire theme."
Chief Konner, This is my nephew over here.
Leslie Knope, Hmm.
Chief Konner, And this is an attractive lady with a hamburger for a head.
Chief Konner," Just some stuff we liked, you know? Anyway, we had a lot of fun putting it together."
Leslie Knope," Well, good luck."
Chief Konner, Thanks.
Chief Konner, We think it's a winner.
Mark Brendanawicz, Go ahead.
Leslie Knope, What?
Mark Brendanawicz,Camel's way more fun.
Leslie Knope, I want my team back.
Leslie Knope," And my team made this hot, crazy camel mess."
Leslie Knope," So, this is what we're going to submit."
Leslie Knope, Even if it means we lose.
Leslie Knope," God, I hope we win."
Leslie Knope, But we're definitely going to lose.
Ann Perkins, Probably.
Leslie Knope, All right.
Leslie Knope, Let's get in there and show them how Parks gets it done.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, And Ann.
Ann Perkins, How Ann gets it done.
Donna Meagle, Yes!
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Paul,What are the shapes?
Ann Perkins,"The shapes are awesome, is what they are."
Ann Perkins, You can't handle it.
Paul," No, I actually like them."
Extra, Forgive me.
Extra, Is that Michael Jackson?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle, The pride of Indiana.
April Ludgate, That's right.
April Ludgate," So, it's relevant."
Extra, Who is he carrying?
Leslie Knope,Jesus Greg Kinnear.
Paul," You know, it looks like he's carrying Kinnear into the burning building."
Leslie Knope," Oh, well, that's because he's moonwalking."
Leslie Knope," So, he should be going the other way."
Leslie Knope, That did not occur to me.
April Ludgate, Sorry.
Leslie Knope," So, there you go."
Leslie Knope, The Spirit of Pawnee.
Leslie Knope, We didn't win.
Leslie Knope, But neither did anyone else.
Leslie Knope, They realized it was going to cost a ton of money to hire a muralist.
Leslie Knope," So, they're just going to restore the old one."
Leslie Knope," They're changing the title to ""The Diversity Express."""
Leslie Knope," Oh, well."
April Ludgate,Aw.
Jerry Gergich,Yay!
Donna Meagle,Ah! Look at that.
Tom Haverford, It's not as good as the other one.
Artist," I don't know what you mean by ""good."""
Tom Haverford,Neither do I! Just do another one.
Artist," You know, I have actual assignments that I have to finish for art school?"
Tom Haverford,Shut up and do more art for me.
Tom Haverford, This one's racist.
Tom Haverford, It's beautiful.
Tom Haverford, I've looked at this for five hours now.
Tom Haverford, I like the green one.
Tom Haverford, And the red circle right here.

Tom Haverford,It's pretty great having Andy working in the building.
Tom Haverford,The guy is so much fun.
Tom Haverford,His new thing?
Tom Haverford,Piggyback rides!
Tom Haverford,Anytime you want.
Andy Dwyer,Piggyback!

Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Councilman Howser,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Did you get my proposal for the possible rezoning of Lot 48?
Councilman Howser,I have been busy.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,But I think it would be a really great thing for the neighborhood.
Councilman Howser,I don't doubt it.
Councilman Howser,But it's really a question of resource allocation.
Leslie Knope,And I completely understand that.
Leslie Knope,"But you and I both know that if we wanna find the money, we can."
Councilman Howser,I'm running late.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'll walk with you."
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, when we allocate money for parks"
Ron Swanson,Just a reminder.
Ron Swanson,Tomorrow's a half day.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, Mark and I have to conduct the annual trail survey at Slippery Elm Park."
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I had the trail survey hats made to commemorate the trip."
Ron Swanson,"Nice, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, and if you have any questions about the details, feel free to shoot me an email."
Leslie Knope,The only trails he's gonna be surveying are trails of lies and deception.
Leslie Knope,Ron has a special deal with the park rangers.
Leslie Knope,"Every November, they let him use their cabin so he can go on a secret hunting trip with all the guys in the office."
Tom Haverford,Not all the guys.
Tom Haverford,He's never taken me.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, all the men."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, let's cut the bull."
Leslie Knope,"I want me, Tom and all the other ladies included on your hunting trip."
Ron Swanson,Hunting trip?
Ron Swanson,"We're doing a trail survey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,You're literally listening to turkey calls.
Ron Swanson,Is this not rap?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,"Look, it's not just a hunting trip, it's a tradition."
Leslie Knope,I am really good at hunting and I'm even better at being one of the guys.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's a work event, so legally I can't stop you from coming."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so fun!
Leslie Knope,I'll bring S'mores.
Ron Swanson,And just like that the one tiny aspect of government I enjoyed was clubbed to death before my eyes.
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,I need you to do something for me.
Leslie Knope,"I'm going hunting tomorrow, so call the State Parks Office and get verbal confirmation that our budget documentation is in."
Leslie Knope,Can I just tell you the 16 digit tracking number or do you want me to write it down?
Leslie Knope,I'll write it down.
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
April Ludgate,You want me to dial a number and then read another number out loud?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Can you handle this?
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,"Well, try, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"And if you do it, I will name the first turkey I shoot after you."
April Ludgate,Cool.
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Ready to bag some birds?
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Ann Perkins,But I am ready to relax by the fire and get my Real Simple magazine on.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you change your mind, you're now officially a licensed Indiana hunter."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, gross."
Phone Voice,"Hello, you have reached the Indiana State Parks Department."
Phone Voice,Your call is very important to us.
Phone Voice,Please stay on the line.
Leslie Knope,"All right, here we go!"
Ann Perkins,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,There he is.
Ann Perkins,There's Ron!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it's pretty!"
Leslie Knope,I know.
Ann Perkins,I thought it was gonna be gross.
Jerry Gergich,Holy cow.
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, it is good to be back."
Mark Brendanawicz,Sneak attack!
Jerry Gergich,Damn it!
Mark Brendanawicz,I am the Pants King!
Mark Brendanawicz,Bow to me.
Jerry Gergich,Bow!
Jerry Gergich,I bow!
Mark Brendanawicz,I am the Pants--
Leslie Knope,I am the Pants Queen.
Tom Haverford,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,Bow to the Pants Queen.
Leslie Knope,"When you're out with the boys, you gotta be ready for a good pantsing."
Leslie Knope,That's why I have suspenders that connect my bra to my jeans.
Tom Haverford,Ron 'P. Diddy' Combs.
Tom Haverford,"I have to admit, this place is pretty tight."
Tom Haverford,May I interest anyone in some chew?
Ron Swanson,"Nice touch, Haverford."
Leslie Knope,Let me get some of that.
Ron Swanson,You sure?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I would not have pegged you as a user of mouth tobacco.
Leslie Knope,"I'm full of surprises, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man."
Tom Haverford,My stomach's a little upset.
Tom Haverford,I feel a little queasy.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, that might be the chew."
Mark Brendanawicz,You could spit it out.
Tom Haverford,I swallowed it.
Tom Haverford,"You're supposed to swallow it, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Ron Swanson,Poor little buddy.
Leslie Knope,Why they call it chew and not swallow.
Leslie Knope,"Am I right, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, you are right."
Leslie Knope,"All right, safety basics!"
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can you tell me why it's bad to look down the barrel of your gun?"
Donna Meagle,Is that a trick question?
Leslie Knope,"No, Donna, don't!"
Leslie Knope,Please!
Ron Swanson,"Rule number one, do not point the weapon at a person."
Ron Swanson,"That includes your own face, Donna."
Ron Swanson,"Now, every year, before we go on our first hunt, we do a toast."
Ron Swanson,"So, grab a beer."
Ron Swanson,To the hunt.
Jerry Gergich,"Hear, hear."
Leslie Knope,And to the hunters!
Leslie Knope,The only way to defeat the beast is to find the beast within.
Jerry Gergich,Pretty good.
Jerry Gergich,"Here, here!"
Ann Perkins,"Here, here!"
Donna Meagle,Yeah!
Donna Meagle,Right on!
Donna Meagle,Cheers.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, your toast sucked."
Ron Swanson,"The traditional toast is ""To the hunt!"""
Ron Swanson,And it is said by me.
Ron Swanson,"You all set, Mark?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I was thinking maybe we could do mixed doubles, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"Boy girl, boy girl."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you said that we were gonna hunt together."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, I always forget because you're so pretty, you're not used to rejection."
Leslie Knope,I have to hunt with Ron.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, we'll go together."
Leslie Knope,Perfect!
Leslie Knope,"All right, I hope you're ready to discuss some college bowl game scenarios!"
Ron Swanson,Bully.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,"Can you come here, please?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
April Ludgate,"I've been on hold for, like, an hour and I really have to pee."
April Ludgate,"Can you just sit here for two seconds and just listen, please?"
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"And if they answer, can you just read those numbers out loud?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Okay, thanks."
Leslie Knope,Now here's the female adolescent turkey.
Leslie Knope,Could you hear the difference?
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Turkeys can.
Jerry Gergich,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ron Swanson,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ron Swanson,We do that the first time one of us hits something.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cool!"
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola--"
Ron Swanson,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,You missed it.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ron, I know this weekend, you were looking forward to a lot of man on man on man action, but I just wanted to say I'm very grateful that you let me come along on this trip."
Ron Swanson,That's fine.
Ron Swanson,I'm just glad you didn't end up inviting more of the motor--
Ron Swanson,What the hell?
Ron Swanson,Give me some warning!
Leslie Knope,I saw a quail.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, man, you snooze, you lose."
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Ann Perkins,"Boola, boola, boola!"
Leslie Knope,I think this is gonna be a really good bonding sesh for me and Ron.
Leslie Knope,Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check this out."
Andy Dwyer,"I am on hold with the State Parks Department I am on hold, so suck on my butt."
April Ludgate,Nice.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"They didn't answer, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,Where is everyone?
April Ludgate,Hunting trip.
Andy Dwyer,Hunting trip?
Andy Dwyer,Did Mark go?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"That's cool, at least he's not with Ann."
April Ludgate,"No, Ann's there."
Andy Dwyer,God!
Andy Dwyer,How come he gets to do all the things I wanna do?
Andy Dwyer,"Go hunting, Ann."
April Ludgate,Maybe a deer will eat him.
Andy Dwyer,That would be really awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"But I don't think that will happen, probably."
Leslie Knope,You're surprised that my breasts didn't throw my aim off?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, please."
Ron Swanson,I don't care that you're a girl.
Ron Swanson,I just don't like change.
Ron Swanson,"I like going to the same place with the same people, telling the same stories and seeing who can bag the most turkeys."
Leslie Knope,It seems like you like to go hunting with the same people 'cause you know you can beat them.
Ron Swanson,A hundred bucks says I bag more birds than you.
Ron Swanson,You're on.
Ron Swanson,Let's split up.
Ron Swanson,I do it better alone.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you do!"
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,Just one of the guys.
Tom Haverford,Your favorite kind of cake can't be birthday cake.
Tom Haverford,That's like saying your favorite kind of cereal is breakfast cereal.
Donna Meagle,"Mmm, I love breakfast cereal."
Tom Haverford,Look!
Tom Haverford,Some kind of bird!
Tom Haverford,Let's kill it!
Tom Haverford,"You talking to me, bitch?"
Jerry Gergich,What were you aiming at?
Donna Meagle,Nothing.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I can understand why people like that.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right?
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,Yeah!
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,And keeping one's eyes open is always a good rule of thumb around guns.
Jerry Gergich,This is such a great day.
Jerry Gergich,"See, at my house, I got a wife and three beautiful daughters."
Jerry Gergich,"But this trip, it is the one time of year I get to pee standing up."
Jerry Gergich,I love that sound.
Ron Swanson,I've been shot!
Ron Swanson,I've been shot!
Ron Swanson,Somebody shot me in the head!
Leslie Knope,"Boola, boola, boola."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,Over here.
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, right there."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I got your hat!"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have your hat!"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Are you in a lot of pain?
Ron Swanson,I was shot in the head with a shotgun.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, it's actually not that serious."
Ann Perkins,"I just need you to stay calm, okay?"
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I'm just gonna stay angry."
Ron Swanson,I find that relaxes me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, we called 911 and they're gonna send a ranger."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, damn!"
Ron Swanson,This is a mess.
Ron Swanson,The rangers won't let us come back next year.
Leslie Knope,No!
Ann Perkins,We're not gonna think about that right now.
Ann Perkins,"You guys, can you just put him on the day bed in the carcass room?"
Mark Brendanawicz,Day bed?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,Sure.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now."
Jerry Gergich,Hold on!
Jerry Gergich,Hold on!
Ann Perkins,Is that Donna?
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, easy."
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Mark Brendanawicz,Don't worry.
Ann Perkins,Are you okay?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,Is it your heart?
Ann Perkins,Are you having trouble breathing?
Donna Meagle,It's my car.
Donna Meagle,Someone shot my car!
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Here's your Scotch, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's here.
Jerry Gergich,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,"Here's your Scotch, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"There we go, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what is great?"
Leslie Knope,Ann's gonna take care of you.
Leslie Knope,And Ann is the best nurse in North America.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Ron Swanson,Did you shoot me?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"There was a bird kind of near me, and I know how desperate you were to prove yourself."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, I swear, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I swear to God, I've never shot anyone."
Ron Swanson,"Well, you better find out who it was."
Ron Swanson,"And then, purchase them a coffin, because I'm gonna rip them apart."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
April Ludgate,Polo!
Andy Dwyer,Marco!
April Ludgate,Polo!
Andy Dwyer,Marco?

April Ludgate,Polo!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,How are you feeling?
Leslie Knope,How are you feeling?
Ann Perkins,Are you dizzy?
Leslie Knope,Are you dizzy or--
Ann Perkins,Are you lightheaded?
Ron Swanson,"When I look at my palm, I see a lady's mouth French kissing a dog."
Ron Swanson,Is that normal?
Leslie Knope,Is that normal?
Ann Perkins,"Well, the pain medication I gave you is pretty strong."
Ann Perkins,Donna uses it for menstrual cramps.
Ann Perkins,How many did you take?
Ron Swanson,Seven.
Ron Swanson,Eight.
Ron Swanson,But I washed them down with plenty of fluids.
Ann Perkins,"No, Ron, you cannot drink Scotch with this."
Ann Perkins,"You're gonna need to purge, right now!"
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Ron Swanson,No!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ron Swanson,"No, I'm not wasting 20 year scotch."
Ann Perkins,Can you open his mouth?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,Open his mouth.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ann Perkins,Open his mouth.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'm not making myself throw up.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry we have to do this!
Ann Perkins,"Ron, you have to."
Ann Perkins,Ron?
Leslie Knope,This is for your own good.
Ron Swanson,I will bite you!
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, get, grab his mustache!"
Leslie Knope,Open your mouth!
Leslie Knope,Just-- Open your mouth!
Ann Perkins,His shoulders!
Leslie Knope,"Well, good news is Ron is resting comfortably."
Tom Haverford,Is he okay?
Tom Haverford,Is he gonna live?
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope,Although I am hoping that he has some memory loss.
Tom Haverford,"On a scale of one to Chris Brown, how pissed is he?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's very curious about who shot him."
Leslie Knope,"So, if you did it, just say, ""I did it."""
Leslie Knope,"Come on, person who shot Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I think it's a little weird that nobody wants to admit that they shot Ron in the head."
Tom Haverford,Maybe Ron shot himself.
Leslie Knope," Hmm, he has seemed really depressed lately."
Mark Brendanawicz, He was shot in the back of the head.
Leslie Knope, You're right.
Leslie Knope, He loves the back of his head.
Leslie Knope, He would never shoot himself there.
Tom Haverford, It could have been someone else that shot Ron.
Tom Haverford, Someone not in our group.
Jerry Gergich, You think someone is hunting us?
Tom Haverford,Man is the most dangerous game.
Donna Meagle, To The Predator.
Tom Haverford, I did smell something out there.
Tom Haverford, And it wasn't human.
Leslie Knope, That was pine trees.
Donna Meagle, The Predator can see heat.
Tom Haverford, We should cover ourselves in mud.
Tom Haverford, It could still be out there.
Donna Meagle, Did you hear that?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Actually, I did hear something."
Jerry Gergich, Okay.
Jerry Gergich, There's someone out there.
Tom Haverford, I'm gonna get my gun.
Jerry Gergich," Okay, Tom."
Jerry Gergich, Scare him off and shoot over his head!
Tom Haverford,What's that gonna do? I'm gonna shoot under its head!
Mark Brendanawicz, Don't shoot anyone!
Leslie Knope,Whoa! Where are you going?
Mark Brendanawicz,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Extra,Hey! Don't shoot! Hey!
Extra,It's Craig from Reinhold Mercedes!
Donna Meagle,"Craig! Craig, I got you, dog! Craig! Don't worry, I'm coming!"
Ron Swanson,"Attention, person who shot me in the head! I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna tear you apart."
Ann Perkins, Ron! Bed! Now!
Ron Swanson,Okay.
April Ludgate, That man wasn't my brother.
April Ludgate, He was my husband.
Andy Dwyer, How was that? That wasn't good?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you can do better."
Andy Dwyer, All right.
Andy Dwyer, Give me another one.
April Ludgate, Okay.
April Ludgate, I'm pregnant with Josh Groban's baby.
April Ludgate, That was good.
Andy Dwyer, You do one.
April Ludgate, Okay.
Andy Dwyer, What do you mean the squirrel took the nuts out of the... Out of that kid's backpack and ate them?
April Ludgate,But you have to give me a reason to spit.
April Ludgate, To spit! You asked me a…
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah."
April Ludgate, Don't ask me a question.
Andy Dwyer, I won't.
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Andy Dwyer, Not a question.
April Ludgate," Okay, ready?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, I've lived in Pawnee my whole life.
Andy Dwyer, That is a fact.
Andy Dwyer, A fact about me.
Andy Dwyer, And how…
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope, How is he?
Ann Perkins,He's pretty out of it.
Ann Perkins, He's talking about you in his sleep.
Leslie Knope, Good stuff?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins, How's it going out there?
Leslie Knope,Terribly.
Leslie Knope, No one will admit they shot Ron.
Leslie Knope, And no one saw it happen.
Ann Perkins, I know what happened.
Leslie Knope, You do?
Park Ranger,"Listen, I heard about the accident."
Park Ranger, And I need to know who is responsible.
Jerry Gergich, I don't know.
Donna Meagle, Ron and I saw Jerry
Jerry Gergich,That's the problem.
Leslie Knope, I am.
Leslie Knope, I shot Ron Swanson.
Donna Meagle, You shot my Mercedes?
Leslie Knope,What? No! No!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, follow my light."
Ann Perkins," No, not your whole head."
Ann Perkins, Just your eyes.
Ann Perkins, Just... Yeah.
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Ann Perkins, What month is it?
Leslie Knope,November.
Ann Perkins, Why are you taking the blame for this?
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope, I know what I'm doing.
Leslie Knope, Just go look after Ron.
Park Ranger, So what happened? Did you forget to check the entire field? I find a lot of women have problems with tunnel vision.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, I'm an excellent hunter.
Park Ranger, How did you end up shooting a guy in the head then?
Leslie Knope,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope, I was walking in the woods and then I tripped and my gun went off.
Park Ranger," Ah, so you forgot to put the safety on."
Leslie Knope," No, I always have the safety on."
Leslie Knope," I'm... While I was tripping, I saw a quail and I shot at it."
Park Ranger, In mid-trip?
Leslie Knope,"No, that's-- Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope, I got that tunnel vision that girls get.
Leslie Knope, And that's what happened.
Leslie Knope, End of story.
Park Ranger," I think you're hysterical because of all the excitement, obviously."
Park Ranger," So, I'm just not following your story."
Park Ranger, All right?
Leslie Knope,I let my emotions get the best of me.
Leslie Knope," I just I would I cared too much, I guess."
Leslie Knope, I was thinking with my lady parts.
Leslie Knope, I was walking and I felt something icky.
Leslie Knope, I thought there was gonna be chocolate.
Leslie Knope, I don't even remember.
Leslie Knope," I'm wearing a new bra and it closes in the front, so it popped open and it threw me off."
Leslie Knope," All I wanna do is have babies! Are you single? I'm just, like, going through a thing right now."
Leslie Knope, I guess when my life is incomplete I wanna shoot someone.
Leslie Knope, This would not happen if I had a penis.
Leslie Knope, What? Bitches be crazy.
Leslie Knope, I'm good at tolerating pain.
Leslie Knope, I'm bad at math.
Leslie Knope, And I'm stupid.
April Ludgate, I wonder what they're doing right now.
Andy Dwyer, Probably making out on top of a deer carcass.
Andy Dwyer, Super romantic.
April Ludgate," You know, if I gave you a hickey, it would totally make Ann jealous."
Andy Dwyer," I don't know, I think that would... That's pretty gross."
Andy Dwyer, Seems kind of weird.
April Ludgate, What's weird about one friend sucking on another friend's neck?
Andy Dwyer,"When you put it that way, it doesn't sound that weird at all."
April Ludgate," Yeah, it's not."
April Ludgate, I gave my gay boyfriend's boyfriend a hickey and it totally made my gay boyfriend jealous.
Andy Dwyer, Really? All right.
Andy Dwyer, Awesome.
Andy Dwyer, I'm in.
Andy Dwyer, I'm gonna go sterilize my neck.
April Ludgate, Okay.
April Ludgate, What?
Ron Swanson,"You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple of months."
Ron Swanson, I usually watch it with my brothers.
Ron Swanson, Maybe you could come by at halftime and shoot me in the head.
Leslie Knope," Ron, I'm really sorry that I ruined your weekend."
Ron Swanson," Perhaps next time I'm enjoying some alone time in the men's restroom, you could invite yourself into my stall and shoot me in the head."
Leslie Knope," Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you Sure."
Ron Swanson," How about you shoot me in the head? Oh, wait, you already did that."
Ann Perkins," Hey, Tom, can I talk to you for a second?"
Tom Haverford,"Hold on, this is amazing."
Ann Perkins, Now.
Ann Perkins, I need to talk to you now.
Tom Haverford, Okay.
Tom Haverford," Okay! Whoa! Ann! Whoa, are we finally gonna do this? Ow!"
Ann Perkins,I saw you shoot Ron.
Ann Perkins," Okay? Leslie covered for you, but I'm not gonna let her take any more crap from Ron on your sorry ass behalf."
Tom Haverford," Okay, for the record, I was gonna come forward and I'll do it right now."
Tom Haverford," But afterwards, can we come back here and talk about us?"
Ron Swanson,"Maybe the next time I'm at the doctor's office getting my prostate examined, you could come by and shoot me in the head!"
Tom Haverford,"Excuse me, everyone."
Tom Haverford," Ron, I have something to say."
Ron Swanson," Hang on a minute, Tom, I'm not done berating Leslie."
Tom Haverford, It wasn't Leslie's fault.
Tom Haverford, She was covering for me because I didn't have a hunting license.
Tom Haverford, I was the one who shot you.
Ron Swanson," You didn't get a license? What kind of moron doesn't get a license? That's reckless endangerment, my son."
Ron Swanson," That's a 25,000 fine dollars, minimum, and probably jail time."
Tom Haverford," But she covered for me, and I'm in the clear."
Ron Swanson, Yeah.
Ron Swanson, That's right.
Ron Swanson, She kept her mouth shut and now you're in the clear.
Leslie Knope," Well, Ron, you know, I couldn't let--"
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson, You did good.
Ron Swanson, You're a real stand-up guy.
Ron Swanson, I'm sorry I lost my temper before.
Ron Swanson, It was 'cause I was shot in the head by a moron.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Tom Haverford," Dude, Ron, I'm so sorry."
Ron Swanson," Apology not accepted, moron."
Ann Perkins, Pants King!
Leslie Knope,Pants Queen!
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Ann."
Ann Perkins, Hey.
Jerry Gergich, Mmm! Turkey's great.
Mark Brendanawicz," Hey, Ron Swanson!"
Jerry Gergich,Hey!
Mark Brendanawicz,Ron Swanson!
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson," Thank you, all."
Leslie Knope," Welcome back, Ron."
Ron Swanson," Oh, hey!"
Ron Swanson,"Welcome back, Ron."
Ron Swanson,That's terrific.
Ron Swanson," Thanks, you guys."
Ron Swanson, Let's eat!

Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need you to go up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles on the fourth floor.
Ron Swanson,We gotta talk ourselves out of this late registration fee for the Parks van.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to go to the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,That is the creepiest place on Earth.
Leslie Knope,The fourth floor is awful.
Leslie Knope,"The DMV, divorce filings, probation offices."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"They put a popcorn machine up there just to brighten things up, but they used the wrong kind of oil, and a bunch of people had to get their throats replaced."
Ron Swanson,"They'll only talk to you or me, and I can't go, because I don't want to."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Stranger,"Hey, boo."
Stranger,You're pretty.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Thank you, sir."
Stranger,"Hey, girl."
Stranger,Are you on probation?
Stranger,I got clean urine.
Stranger,You need female?
Stranger,I got female.
Leslie Knope,"I'm good, thank you."
Stranger,"Hey, you clean?"
Stranger,"I buy, too."
Background,Order.
Background,Order!
Background,Next case.
Background,Indiana vs--
Leslie Knope,Tom and Wendy?
Extra,Popcorn?
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, how's everything in your life, generally?"
Tom Haverford,Amazing.
Tom Haverford,Took a risk.
Tom Haverford,Bought some shoes online.
Tom Haverford,"Paid off handsomely, as you can see."
Leslie Knope,Uh-huh.
Leslie Knope,"And how are your institutions, that you're a part of?"
Tom Haverford,Ah.
Tom Haverford,You heard about my divorce?
Leslie Knope,I saw you on the fourth floor.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so, so sorry."
Tom Haverford,"Honestly, it's fine."
Tom Haverford,"Lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and the guy from Sum 41, am I right?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know what those are.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Tom, stop working."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Would have been nice to have saved that.
Leslie Knope,You should've autosaved that.
Tom Haverford,Right.
Leslie Knope,That kind of feels like your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I've heard your voice when she calls you on the phone."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you look at her ass when she leaves the room.
Leslie Knope,You love her.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm fine."
Tom Haverford,"Look, look at my face."
Tom Haverford,Are you watching?
Leslie Knope,"I did a little research, and divorce is the number two most stressful event in a person's life."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, marriage is number seven."
Leslie Knope,"So, watch out, everyone."
Leslie Knope,It's all bad.
Leslie Knope,"We have to step up, for Tom's sake."
Ron Swanson,I think Tom seems fine.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is the problem."
Leslie Knope,"Tom always seems like Mr. Slickster Cool Guy, but he's actually hiding his emotions underneath a very thick layer of Axe body spray."
Leslie Knope,We have to help him.
Leslie Knope,We are his safe bubble.
April Ludgate,She's kind of right.
April Ludgate,"None of his family lives here, and all of his friends are frat guys and morons."
Ron Swanson,This seems like none of our business.
Leslie Knope,"Be supportive, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Don't be all, like, ""No, I don't want to."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am a guy and I like fire and playing hockey and eating meat!"""
Leslie Knope,"""No, no, says I!"""
April Ludgate,That was a really good Ron.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know how to explain--
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand still doesn't have that syphilis medication you were asking about.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,What a coincidence!
Andy Dwyer,Are you in this office purely for business reasons?
Ann Perkins,"Pleasure, actually."
Ann Perkins,My boyfriend Mark works here.
Ann Perkins,He's sitting right next to me.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Andy."
Mark Brendanawicz,"What a surprise, running into you all day, every day, every single place that we are."
Andy Dwyer,Likewise.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I guess I'll see you guys around."
Ann Perkins,See you.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, also, Mark, again, we don't have those extra small condoms you ordered."
Andy Dwyer,"I called the factory, it's gonna take a special order."
Andy Dwyer,"Not just because of the size, but because of the weird shape as well."
Andy Dwyer,Something they've never dealt with before.
Andy Dwyer,We'll talk.
Andy Dwyer,"Mark never asked me for any small, weirdly shaped condoms."
Andy Dwyer,I made that up.
Andy Dwyer,"Every day, I subtly chip away at their relationship."
Andy Dwyer,"Weakening it, little by little."
Extra,Where's Tom Haverford?
Tom Haverford,For [bleep] sake.
Extra,"So, you had a divorce , of course, of course"
Extra,"And no one enjoys a divorce, of course"
Tom Haverford,"I don't know what to do, man."
Tom Haverford,"I can't be like, ""Hey, Leslie, it's a green card marriage, I'm fine."""
Ron Swanson,"You know, Leslie just thinks you're a wounded animal, so her female instincts are kicking in."
Ron Swanson,Here's what you do.
Ron Swanson,"Act sad, let her pull the thorn out of your paw and wrap a bandage around it."
Ron Swanson,That'll make her feel better.
Ron Swanson,She'll get off your jock.
Tom Haverford,You still can't tell anyone about the green card thing.
Tom Haverford,Apparently you can get in trouble even after a divorce.
Ron Swanson,Damn the man.
Ron Swanson,"Well, hey, your secret's safe with me."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Rondoleezza Rice."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, everyone."
Tom Haverford,The rumors are true.
Tom Haverford,Wendy and I are splitting up.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm really hurt."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry you feel that way, little friend."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we go out tonight, hit the town after work, huh?"
Leslie Knope,We'll make it Tom's night.
Leslie Knope,"You can go anywhere you want, our treat."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I know there's a really fun documentary about tandem bicycles at the art house."
Leslie Knope,It's supposed to be pretty unapologetic.
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to a restaurant--
Tom Haverford,Strip club?
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?
Leslie Knope,No…
Tom Haverford,Did somebody say strip club?
Leslie Knope,You did.
Tom Haverford,I definitely heard someone say strip club.
Leslie Knope,You just did.
Tom Haverford,Would the Glitter Factory be okay with whoever suggested strip club?
Leslie Knope,"I don't think that's a good idea, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,There is a great dinosaur themed restaurant in Patterson.
Jerry Gergich,It is called Jurassic Fork.
Jerry Gergich,I have gone there three times a week for the last 15 years.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Dinosaurs, huh?"
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Sounds okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"It's gonna be a crazy night, guys!"
Leslie Knope,I will see you at Jurassic Fork at 5:45 p.m.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Waiter,Hi.
Waiter,"Welcome to Jurassic Fork, where the only thing that'll be extinct is your appetite."
Waiter,You ready to order?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,I will have the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Veloci-Wrap.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna get the Tricera-chops, please."
Waiter,How do you want that cooked?
Leslie Knope,Medium roar.
Waiter,Medium rare?
Leslie Knope,"No, medium roar."
Waiter,"For legal reasons, we're not allowed to make puns about the temperature of the meats anymore."
Tom Haverford,"I'll have the surf and turf- asaurus, and a couple of bottles of wine."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna need a lot of wine, so keep it flowing."
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna be drinking anything.
Ann Perkins,Just wanted everybody to know that.
Ann Perkins,I'm not a big fan of group dinners where everybody splits the bill no matter what they get.
Ann Perkins,"I ordered a Tyranna-Caesar salad, and that's all I'm paying for."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out."
Andy Dwyer,They got pool.
Andy Dwyer,"Mark, you want to play a quick game?"
Andy Dwyer,Finally settle the debate about who's the better pool player?
Mark Brendanawicz,"I've never had that debate with anyone, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, we'll put a little money on it."
Andy Dwyer,Make it a little more interesting.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, please."
Andy Dwyer,"No, I just figured because pool is all about angles and he's a failed architect that he might want to play pool."
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,That worked?
Andy Dwyer,"How to hustle somebody in pool, by Andy Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,"Step one, find the person you want to hustle."
Andy Dwyer,Invite them to play pool.
Andy Dwyer,"Should they accept, you're in."
Leslie Knope,Here's what I think we should do.
Leslie Knope,Everyone should go around and say one thing that they love about Tom.
Jerry Gergich,I'll start.
Jerry Gergich,I really wish I could have your body.
Tom Haverford,What?
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,"Like, tied up, naked, in your basement?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, you're in good shape and you can eat whatever you want."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was weird, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you go ahead."
Ann Perkins,I think Tom is really nice.
Ann Perkins,"Also, if you guys want to give me your credit cards, I'll just divide it up myself, I don't mind."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,The restaurant will just divide it evenly.
Leslie Knope,Just enjoy yourself.
Leslie Knope,"April, go ahead."
April Ludgate,Tom is the only cool person in the office.
Leslie Knope,Ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Donna Meagle,"I love you, Tom."
Donna Meagle,You're my little prince.
Donna Meagle,I just want to put you in a little cape and a little hat and just fly you around.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, garcon."
Tom Haverford,I'm still feeling pretty sad.
Tom Haverford,Can I get two creme brulees and another glass of bronto grigio?
Leslie Knope,"I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad."
Leslie Knope,Why would he do that?
Mark Brendanawicz,And that's game.
Mark Brendanawicz,I think you now owe me 25 dollars.
Andy Dwyer,Shoot.
Andy Dwyer,"Someone had a pool table growing up, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,What do you say we play again?
Andy Dwyer,We'll make it a little more interesting.
Andy Dwyer,Go double or nothing?
Mark Brendanawicz,Why not?
Andy Dwyer,Step two.
Andy Dwyer,Lose to your opponent intentionally so they gain confidence.
Andy Dwyer,Step two has been completed easily.
Andy Dwyer,Very easily.
Andy Dwyer,Mark is pretty good at pool.
Ron Swanson,"So, how are you feeling, Tom?"
Ron Swanson,Are you feeling okay?
Tom Haverford,I like pretending to be sad.
Tom Haverford,I now see why girls do it.
Ron Swanson,"So, your arrangement with Wendy, it really was completely platonic?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Never so much as even kissed, except for a little peck at the wedding ceremony for appearances."
Ron Swanson,"Uh, now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy."
Ron Swanson,"Would it be okay with you if I was to ask her out, once the fake dust settles?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, why not?"
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Ron Swanson,"Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna take a leak.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh!
Mark Brendanawicz,"That would be 6,400 dollars."
Mark Brendanawicz,I accept checks and most major credit cards.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Mark is way better than me.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna... I'm gonna say that there is at least a chance that I didn't think this through completely.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I think I'm done, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Forget money.
Andy Dwyer,We'll play for something else.
Mark Brendanawicz,You have nothing else to give me.
Andy Dwyer,I have a T-shirt I tackled Eddie Vedder in.
Andy Dwyer,It's literally priceless.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, how about this?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, you don't owe me any money, but if I win, you have to stop bugging me and Ann."
Andy Dwyer,What are you talking about?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No more comments, no more showing up when we're hanging out together."
Mark Brendanawicz,You have to leave us alone.
Andy Dwyer,"That doesn't seem like a very fair bet, Mark."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if I win, I also get Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, fine."
Mark Brendanawicz,"If you win, then you get Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Rack them up!
April Ludgate,Somebody punch someone!
Leslie Knope,"So, how you doing, buddy?"
Leslie Knope,Want some steak?
Leslie Knope,Champagne?
Leslie Knope,Think of something extravagant and we'll get it for you.
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,A cheese fountain?
Leslie Knope,A ruby?
Leslie Knope,A goose heart?
Tom Haverford,How about a marriage?
Tom Haverford,How about a non-divorce?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, think about it."
Tom Haverford,Does our marriage really make sense to you?
Tom Haverford,"She's a tall, beautiful surgeon."
Tom Haverford,"I'm a short, beautiful government employee slash club promoter."
Leslie Knope,You're a club promoter?
Tom Haverford,Aspiring.
Tom Haverford,"The point is, I never meant anything to her."
Tom Haverford,It wasn't even a real marriage.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a T-Rex."
Leslie Knope,I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, crap."
Leslie Knope,We are going to the Glitter Factory.
Tom Haverford,What?
Donna Meagle,Not me.
Donna Meagle,I can't go back there.
Donna Meagle,"But if you see Jasmine, tell her she can keep Anthony, but I want my microwave back."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take April home.
April Ludgate,"No, I want to go to the Glitter Factory."
Leslie Knope,"Well, drop out of school and start doing meth."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, everybody."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but once you go in there, you will see things you cannot unsee."
Leslie Knope,"I'm a feminist, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I would never, ever go to a strip club."
Leslie Knope,"I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be ""Equality."""
Leslie Knope,But I'm willing to sacrifice all that I've worked for just to put a smile on your perverted little face.
Leslie Knope,So don't blow this.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Lap dances are on me.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm paying for them."
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna actually be on me.
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like Jane Goodall studying the chimps, you know?"
Leslie Knope,'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.
Tom Haverford,There is a girl here that also works at Quiznos.
Tom Haverford,"She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I'm gonna put these in places you've never heard of."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I've been a little down."
Tom Haverford,Totally natural.
Tom Haverford,I'm getting divorced.
Tom Haverford,"But now, I'm ready to pull myself up by some g-strings."
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,It is rough in here.
Leslie Knope,Is it always like this?
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't know.
Ron Swanson,Don't like strip clubs.
Ron Swanson,Smells like a wet mop in here.
Ron Swanson,And I get the feeling that every one of these women is running a low-grade fever.
Leslie Knope,"You're one of the good ones, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Wait a minute.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, beautiful."
Ron Swanson,Strippers do nothing for me.
Ron Swanson,"I like a strong, salt of the earth, self-possessed woman at the top of her field."
Ron Swanson,"Your Steffi Grafs, your Sheryl Swoopeses."
Ron Swanson,"But I will take a free breakfast buffet any time, any place."
Ron Swanson,"Tom cat, pull up a mouth."
Ron Swanson,This buffet is unstoppable.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm not hungry."
Ron Swanson,"By the way, you're doing a bang-up job of looking sad about Wendy."
Ron Swanson,Does she make scrambled eggs?
Tom Haverford,No.
Ron Swanson,Take it down a notch.
Ron Swanson,"You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio."
Announcer,Coming on stage next is Angel.
Announcer,Angel!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ann, in case I don't sink this, it's been a real pleasure dating you."
Andy Dwyer,Scratch on the eight!
Andy Dwyer,I'm victorious.
Andy Dwyer,I am awesome at pool and I hustled your ass.
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, take a moment to say goodbye."
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know how to say this.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I am so sorry, and I will do my best to visit you on holidays."
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, you tried."
Mark Brendanawicz,I guess you're his now.
Ann Perkins,Do you want to get out of here?
Mark Brendanawicz,I do.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"I know that, legally, Ann is now mine, but it weirdly doesn't feel that way."
Leslie Knope,"All right, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,This is Seabiscuit.
Sierra,Sierra.
Leslie Knope,Sierra.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,It's loud in here.
Leslie Knope,And I gave her money to writhe around on your parts.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I don't want to do that."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I already paid her."
Leslie Knope,Can I get my money back?
Sierra,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let her do her writhing."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,"I just gotta say, Sierra."
Leslie Knope,"I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting."
Leslie Knope,"But go crazy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Give my friend here the works.
Leslie Knope,Really grind the sorrow out of him.
Sierra,You got it.
Leslie Knope,"And then, afterwards, maybe reconsider your profession, but for now, grind away."
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Stripper dancing action!
Tom Haverford,This isn't working.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to do this.
Leslie Knope,"Is it because you have a strong, positive female figure watching you?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,It's because I'm miserable.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Seabiscuit."
Leslie Knope,That'll be all.
Announcer,"All Glitter Factory girls, please come backstage."
Leslie Knope, Tom.
Tom Haverford, I don't know what's wrong with me.
Tom Haverford, This is honestly the saddest I've ever been.
Announcer, Glitter Bomb! Ah!
Tom Haverford,I've been to the Glitter Factory a million times.
Tom Haverford," That girl up there, she's my emergency contact."
Tom Haverford," But right now, I hate it here, and I just want to see Wendy."
Leslie Knope," Tom, it's perfectly normal to feel devastated when something's over."
Leslie Knope, It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended.
Tom Haverford, Sixty days.
Tom Haverford, And then she's free to marry Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope, What? Ron?
Tom Haverford,He's gonna ask her out.
Tom Haverford, He told me.
Tom Haverford, But who cares?
Tom Haverford,"If it's not him, it'll just be some other guy."
Leslie Knope, Swanson! Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy?
Ron Swanson,It's complicated.
Leslie Knope," What is wrong with you? I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy."
Leslie Knope, I don't get men.
Leslie Knope," If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives."
Leslie Knope, It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies.
Leslie Knope, Tom.
Leslie Knope, Great!
Leslie Knope,"Good, okay."
Leslie Knope," Could you carry him out of here, please? And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife?"
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope, From the knees.
Ron Swanson, He weighs eight pounds.
Wendy, Oh! Oh.
Wendy," Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope," Hi, Wendy."
Leslie Knope," We took Tom out tonight, and he had a little bit too much to drink."
Wendy, Oh!
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy, Come on in.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, You insensitive little hussy.
Wendy, Excuse me?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, whoa."
Ron Swanson, Halt.
Leslie Knope, You're not even divorced yet and you're inviting other men over?
Extra,You're married?
Wendy,Uh... Technically.
Wendy," Yeah, that's... That's my husband."
Extra, Who's he carrying?
Wendy,No.
Wendy," No, that's his... That's his boss."
Wendy, My husband's the one that's being carried by his boss.
Ron Swanson, How's it going?
Extra,Good.
Leslie Knope," You know what, Wendy? You and Ron will be perfect for each other."
Leslie Knope, You two should get married and start a club for people who betray Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope, You have a lovely home.
Ron Swanson," So, where do you want this?"
Leslie Knope,"So, how you feeling? Rough morning?"
Tom Haverford,You know those hangover pills you can order on TV?
Tom Haverford, I threw up a bunch of them this morning.
Tom Haverford, I feel much better.
Leslie Knope," I know last night was really rough, but all I want for you is to be able to get over this."
Tom Haverford," Leslie, I need to tell you something."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Tom Haverford,The reason I was acting weird yesterday was Wendy and I have a green card marriage.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, because you're a Libyan!"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford, Damn it.
Tom Haverford, Wendy's from Canada.
Leslie Knope, Oh! Oh.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Wait.
Leslie Knope, Start again.
Mark Brendanawicz, This--
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ann."
Andy Dwyer, Mark.
Andy Dwyer, You guys got a second? It's about last night.
Ann Perkins, I hope I'm not gonna have to explain to you that you don't actually own me.
Andy Dwyer, Of course not.
Andy Dwyer, I never for one second thought that that was for real.
Andy Dwyer," Look, you don't have to worry about me bothering you anymore."
Andy Dwyer," You clearly have something going, and I should respect that."
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Ann Perkins," If you say ""psych"" right now I'm gonna be really pissed."
Andy Dwyer," You remembered how much I like to say ""psych."""
Andy Dwyer,"But no, no."
Andy Dwyer, This is no psych.
Mark Brendanawicz," Andy, thank you for saying all that just now."
Andy Dwyer, Sure.
Andy Dwyer," Goodbye, A-Cakes."
Andy Dwyer," Hello, Ann."
Andy Dwyer," Goodbye, Ann."
Ann Perkins," Goodbye, Andy."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, oh."
Andy Dwyer," I thought for a second you were gonna chase after me right there, but you didn't, and that's okay."
Andy Dwyer, I meant every word I said.
Leslie Knope," Aw, you like your wife?"
Leslie Knope,That's a bummer.
Leslie Knope, Does anyone else know that you like your wife? Does your wife know that you like your wife?
Tom Haverford,I didn't know until yesterday.
Tom Haverford, So don't tell anyone.
Tom Haverford, Don't tell Ron.
Tom Haverford, It's my problem.
Leslie Knope, How could there possibly still be glitter on me?
Tom Haverford,It takes forever to get off.
Tom Haverford, My crotch looks like a disco ball.
Extra," Leslie's sorry, She called you selfish, of course, She just didn't know the full story, of course, But now that she does, She's sorry, of course, She loves being your deputy. "

Leslie Knope,Prepare to laugh your Asnov!
Leslie Knope,Sid Asnov is a former city councilman.
Leslie Knope,Some of the jokes are sort of inside.
April Ludgate,"Councilman Dexhart, you're involved in yet another scandal?"
April Ludgate,"That's crazier than Mayor Gunderson's dog, Rufus."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there is a new one, and it's a doozy."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to go into the details, but let me just say that it involves multiple women, a love child, nurses, rabbis, priests."
April Ludgate,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope you can all join me at my fundraiser tonight."
Leslie Knope,"I am being supported, of course, by the Glitter Factory and 1-800-Mattress."
Leslie Knope,Classic!
Tom Haverford,"Pawnee is a city that ain't very pretty, And good government is our goal"
April Ludgate,We may not be big And our mayor wears a wig But at least the raccoon infestation is under control
All,It's the most wonderful time in Pawnee
Leslie Knope,"Lot 48 was once a horrible and disgusting pit, and now it's the site of Pawnee's Winter Wonderland."
Leslie Knope,This could not be more perfect if I had planned it myself.
Leslie Knope,Which I did.
Leslie Knope,And it's awesome.
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk skedge, guys."
Leslie Knope,"The kids are gonna come at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday, and everyone's gonna do Santa for two hours, so I would just advise everyone, before you get in your costume, to go to the bathroom, so we can avoid what happened last year."
Jerry Gergich,It was just farts.
Leslie Knope,"6:00 p.m., caroling with the youth choir, and I am proud to announce, for the first time ever this year, our tree lighting ceremony will be simulcast on Internet radio."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,That's a really big deal.

April Ludgate,"Councilman Dexhart wants to meet with you at 9:00 p.m., the Boardwalk Lounge."
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm not scared.
Leslie Knope,I got nothing to apologize for.
Leslie Knope,I could've been a lot harder on him.
Leslie Knope,He got off easy.
Leslie Knope,And often.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, I'll be here all week!"
Andy Dwyer,You gotta tell me about him.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know anything about him.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"He's 23, he's kind of my boyfriend, he's gay."
April Ludgate,"Last year we got drunk and he took me to the Ice Capades, and I didn't get him anything."
Andy Dwyer,And he's gay?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Brokeback Mountain DVD.

April Ludgate,You know what?
April Ludgate,Forget it.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Why are you asking me?
April Ludgate,Because I don't know.
April Ludgate,There's no one else to ask.
April Ludgate,At least you're kind of young.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, I'll tell you what."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna think about it.
Andy Dwyer,"Through the course of all day, I'm gonna mull it over."
Andy Dwyer,"It's all I'm gonna think about, but you're in good hands."

April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,You got that?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Dexhart?
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Councilman Dexhart,Thank you for meeting me.
Leslie Knope,It's my pleasure.
Leslie Knope,I am assuming this is about my performance in the Government Follies last night.
Leslie Knope,"I'd just like to say that I have nothing to apologize for, except for perhaps being too incisive."
Councilman Dexhart,I don't want you to apologize.
Councilman Dexhart,I want to know who told you.
Leslie Knope,Who told me?
Councilman Dexhart,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Nobody.
Leslie Knope,Nobody told me nothing!
Leslie Knope,What are we talking about?
Councilman Dexhart,"Based on that skit, I know you heard about the new scandal that's about to break."
Councilman Dexhart,Who told you?
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the babysitter?
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the nurse who delivered our love child?
Leslie Knope,What?
Councilman Dexhart,"All right, stop playing dumb."
Councilman Dexhart,You know damn well what happened.
Councilman Dexhart,"I got the babysitter pregnant, then when she was in the delivery room, I had sex with not one, but four nurses in a supply closet, as well as a woman whose husband was getting a liver transplant."
Councilman Dexhart,Mmm.
Councilman Dexhart,"Now, which one of them told you?"
Councilman Dexhart,Was it the liver lady?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I-- No one-- I haven't-- I haven't heard any of this, ever, in my whole life."
Councilman Dexhart,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Believe me, I would have remembered this."
Councilman Dexhart,Okay.
Councilman Dexhart,"Well, in that case, everything I just told you was just a funny prank."
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,Hi!
Tom Haverford,How was your meeting?
Leslie Knope,It was fine.
Leslie Knope,Pretty straightforward.
Leslie Knope,Short meeting.
Leslie Knope,He's a busy guy.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, very busy."
Tom Haverford,Look at this article.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,What the--
Perd Hapley,The story of this story is that it won't stop developing.
Perd Hapley,The mystery woman who met with Councilman Dexhart last night appears to be a government employee named Leslie Norp.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Perd Hapley,"According to unconfirmed reports in the Pawnee Sun, the two bent an elbow at this local watering hole, and although they left separately, no one knows where they woke up together."
Perd Hapley,"Perd Hapley, Channel Four News."
Leslie Knope,All I did was write and perform in one amazing skit.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, it's the Pawnee Sun."
Ann Perkins,It's a tabloid.
Ann Perkins,Nobody else has written about it.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, no one believes that garbage."
Tom Haverford,Nobody even reads that thing.
Donna Meagle,Leslie!
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,"Nice work, girl."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,How do I fight back?
Leslie Knope,Give me some options.
April Ludgate,Do you want me to seduce Perd Hapley?
Leslie Knope,How would that help?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,I just want to see if I can do it.
Leslie Knope,"April, I appreciate that, but I don't think it's something worth losing your virginity over."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I don't know if this is important or not, but I have heard a lot of very, very interesting chatter around the shoeshine stand today."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,What have you heard?
Andy Dwyer,A lot of things.
Andy Dwyer,"Like, ""Can you believe it?"""
Andy Dwyer,"and, ""The Parks lady boned Dexhart,"" and, ""Of course she did, she's totally good to go."""
Andy Dwyer,"And one guy was like, ""I wouldn't hit that."""
Andy Dwyer,"And the other guy was like, ""Me neither."""
Andy Dwyer,"And then this third guy was like, ""I would."""
Andy Dwyer,So I don't know if that's helpful at all.
Leslie Knope,"Well, keep your ear to the ground."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I'll just…
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let these people intimidate me.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do my job.
Leslie Knope,I would be lying if I said that I never thought I would be involved in an incident like this.
Leslie Knope,Except I always assumed that I would be the politician and the man would be accused of sleeping with me.
Leslie Knope,"And that man would be the vice president, and I would be the president."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look good."
Leslie Knope,"You need to put some tights on, though, and I want you to make sure you keep your neckline nice and high."
Alexa Softcastle,Leslie Knope?
Alexa Softcastle,"Alexa Softcastle, Pawnee Sun."
Alexa Softcastle,Can I ask you a few questions?
Ron Swanson,Don't say anything.
Leslie Knope,I'm not afraid to say anything.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I have nothing to hide.
Leslie Knope,"I'd never even met Councilman Dexhart before yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about the matter."
Alexa Softcastle,Some people are saying this isn't the first time that you've had sex with a married councilman.
Leslie Knope,Who's saying that?
Alexa Softcastle,Some people.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,This interview is over.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Go home, lay low."
Mark Brendanawicz,The truth will come out.
Leslie Knope,I can't!
Leslie Knope,I have too much work to do.
Leslie Knope,This department is not gonna deputy direct itself.
Ron Swanson,I think we can manage.
Ron Swanson,Just give me your schedule and we'll cover for you.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"I've made copies of Leslie's daily work schedule, so we'll just split into teams, and each team will take..."
Ron Swanson,"Damn, 10 items, and we'll knock this out."
Leslie Knope,"I swear to you, I never even met the guy before last night."
Dave Sanderson,It's okay.
Dave Sanderson,I believe you.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Dave Sanderson,'Course.
Dave Sanderson,"I think I know you pretty well, and that doesn't sound like you."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Dave Sanderson,"If I ever see that guy, I'm gonna punch him right in the face."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's sweet."
Leslie Knope,Use your nightstick.
Ron Swanson,Which meeting is this?
April Ludgate,Reorganization of Local Auditing Systems.
Ron Swanson,Kill me.
Paul,Right.
Paul,First order of business.
Paul,Leslie?
Paul,Where's Leslie?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, um, I gave her the day off, Paul."
Ron Swanson,Thought that was best.
Paul,"Oh, yeah."
Paul,That's good.
Paul,"So you'll be making the presentation then, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, so, that kind of brings us to what I wanted to talk to you about."
Dave Sanderson,You know my Army reserve unit?
Dave Sanderson,We got called up to active duty.
Dave Sanderson,I ship out in four days.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Where you going?
Dave Sanderson,San Diego.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Dave Sanderson,It's not dangerous.
Dave Sanderson,It's mostly maintenance.
Dave Sanderson,"But I'm going for, like, a year."
Dave Sanderson,Maybe 18 months.
Dave Sanderson,And I was kind of hoping that maybe you'd want to come with me.
Dave Sanderson,"Like, on a permanent type basis."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, I don't know, it's kind of a weird question."
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, I joined to put myself through college, and it's, you know, I'm just a desk jockey, but it's still, it's rewarding."
Dave Sanderson,"So, yeah, I guess I'm in love with the Army."
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, Leslie?"
Dave Sanderson,"Well, yeah."
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, that makes a lot more sense."
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, I'm definitely in love with Leslie."
Dave Sanderson,That's affirmative.
Dave Sanderson,"I know this seems kind of fast, but I feel like we got something here."
Leslie Knope,"I do, too."
Dave Sanderson,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Dave Sanderson,You don't have to answer right away.
Dave Sanderson,"Well, you kind of do."
Dave Sanderson,"I mean, I need to know soon."
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Are you gonna go?
Leslie Knope,This whole Dexhart thing is not making me feel very attached to Pawnee right now.
Ann Perkins,San Diego.
Ann Perkins,Jeez.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,You could learn how to surf.
Leslie Knope,I know how to surf.
Leslie Knope,I took lessons when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,I'm actually pretty good.
Ann Perkins,I bet you are.
Ann Perkins,I would miss Leslie like crazy.
Leslie Knope,Aw!
Tom Haverford,"All right, sorted out that payroll issue, this is done."
Mark Brendanawicz,"""Bring a case of beer to Sanitation."""
Mark Brendanawicz,Why?
Tom Haverford,Let's skip that one.
Tom Haverford,They can buy their own beer.
Tom Haverford,I'm getting hungry.
Tom Haverford,Let's get something to eat.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, have you figured out what you're getting Ann for Christmas?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I got her a pretty great computer bag."
Tom Haverford,Yeah?
Tom Haverford,That's a terrible gift.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, Tom, she needs one."
Mark Brendanawicz,"She mentioned it to me two months ago, and I wrote it down."
Mark Brendanawicz,That's what's called being an amazing boyfriend.
Tom Haverford,Have you seen Ann?
Tom Haverford,You know how hot she is?
Tom Haverford,"Men give women of that caliber speedboats, private jets, not computer bags."
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,What do you think I should get her?
Tom Haverford,Diamonds.
Tom Haverford,Can't go wrong with diamonds.
Mark Brendanawicz,Diamonds?
Tom Haverford,There isn't a woman alive who doesn't love diamonds.
Tom Haverford,"Even the super left wing chicks that saw Blood Diamond and cried, when they get a diamond, they're like, ""Yeah, bitch, give me more of them blood diamonds!"""
Tom Haverford,"""Make them extra bloody."""
Tom Haverford,Trust me.
Joan Callamezzo,We are here looking at a videotape.
Joan Callamezzo,This is back in April 2005.
Joan Callamezzo,We're looking at Councilman Dexhart…
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you should see this."
Joan Callamezzo,"And he's now about to shake hands with Leslie Knope, the alleged sex toy."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, for cripes sake!"
Extra,Look at the way she's smiling at him.
Joan Callamezzo,Mmmhmm.
Extra,And then almost unconsciously touching her hands to her hips.
Extra,See that?
Extra,Right there.
Extra,It's like she's sending him a message that she's ready for childbearing.
Joan Callamezzo,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"In a 24 hour news cycle, the tiniest story gets dissected over and over again."
Leslie Knope,"In 2004, a kid from Pawnee went to the Olympics, and it was reported on for over a year."
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't even competing or anything, he just was going, literally, to watch the Olympics."
Ann Perkins,It was way too easy to get this guy here.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart, this has gone far enough."
Leslie Knope,I want you to hold a press conference and clear my name.
Councilman Dexhart,"Mmm, no, thanks."
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Ann Perkins,What's in it for you?
Councilman Dexhart,"To be honest, being linked to Leslie is a lot less damning than the real story."
Councilman Dexhart,You're like a glass of whole milk.
Councilman Dexhart,"What are you, Lutheran?"
Councilman Dexhart,I love Lutherans.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, with all due respect, get a grip."
Leslie Knope,"If you don't hold a press conference, I'm gonna come forward and tell the whole story."
Councilman Dexhart,It won't do you any good.
Councilman Dexhart,"Take it from me, denying only makes things worse."
Councilman Dexhart,"Listen, I gotta go."
Councilman Dexhart,I'm expected at two different maternity wards.
Councilman Dexhart,"But before I go, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask."
Councilman Dexhart,Should we?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Councilman Dexhart,People already think we did it.
Councilman Dexhart,You've got nothing to lose.
Councilman Dexhart,I'm very good.
Leslie Knope,Get out of here!
Councilman Dexhart,"All right, fine."
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,Shoeshine.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,I've been thinking about your gay boyfriend all day.
Andy Dwyer,I have got some awesome ideas.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"First idea, spray tan gift certificates."
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Trip to Germany?
Andy Dwyer,Germany is awesome.
April Ludgate,And expensive.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't think of that.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you know how people say that you should give gifts that you would want to get yourself?"
April Ludgate,What would you want?
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
Andy Dwyer,"Indianapolis Colts' Reggie Wayne jersey, number 87, double XL, home blue, signed by Reggie Wayne right after he catches a touchdown to win the Super Bowl."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Never mind.
Andy Dwyer,No?
Andy Dwyer,Hip Hop Abs dance fitness DVD?
Joan Callamezzo,We just received these exclusive photos.
Joan Callamezzo,We have pictures of City Councilman Dexhart…
Ann Perkins,My God!
Joan Callamezzo,...with Leslie Knope.
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe it!
Extra,"The big issue now is, who is this mystery woman?"
Extra,"She and Knope are standing very close to each other, and any time you see two women standing very close to each other…"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,"No, don't say it."
Extra,you immediately assume…
Ann Perkins,Please don't say it.
Extra,lesbian.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, of course."
Leslie Knope,What?
Joan Callamezzo,It is a veritable storm of information coming into the studios here today.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, this is Leslie Knope, and I would like Joan to clear all of her guests tomorrow, because I'm coming on the show."
Leslie Knope,"If you think that you can drag me and my friend through the mud, then you've got-- Yes, I'll hold."
Ron Swanson,Unbelievable.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Tom Haverford,What happened?
Ron Swanson,Got a call from some panicky morning joggers.
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Sanitation didn't empty this dumpster."
Ron Swanson,To the raccoons' delight.
April Ludgate,I thought raccoons were supposed to be nocturnal.
Ron Swanson,"Not in this town, sweetheart."
Ron Swanson,"In this town, they're 24/ 7."
Ron Swanson,We can't have raccoons for the Christmas thing.
Ron Swanson,They'll hunt the kids for sport.
Ron Swanson,"Fess up, guys."
Ron Swanson,Who dropped the ball?
Tom Haverford,"""Bring a case of beer to Sanitation."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"""Bring a case of"" Yeah, this one's our fault, Ron, and we will take care of this for you."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, good, because I have to run a public forum, supervise the maintenance crews, and teach crafts at the senior center."
Ron Swanson,Simultaneously.
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I just wanted to say thank you for letting me be on your show."
Leslie Knope,I'm really happy that I have the chance to clear my name.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, sure."
Joan Callamezzo,I see you brought your girlfriend for support.
Joan Callamezzo,That's nice.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,She's not my…
Extra,"And in five, Joan."
Leslie Knope,She's a--
Extra,We're Four.
Extra,Three.
Leslie Knope,You've got it wrong.
Joan Callamezzo,Sex.
Joan Callamezzo,"Drugs, possibly."
Joan Callamezzo,Rock and Roll?
Joan Callamezzo,"We'll find out, on Pawnee Today's exclusive interview with the woman at the center of the Dexhart sex scandal, Leslie Knope."
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, my first question has to be, when did the affair start?"
Leslie Knope,"Joan, I spoke with Councilman Dexhart for the first time that night."
Leslie Knope,"We met for about 15 minutes, and then I went home, alone, and that's the whole story."
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Leslie, we all saw the tape from four years ago, and you were flashing some serious ""do me"" eyes."
Joan Callamezzo, That's just my opinion.
Leslie Knope, I don't understand why I'm on trial here.
Leslie Knope, You should be grilling Councilman Dexhart.
Joan Callamezzo, You know what? That's a really good idea.
Joan Callamezzo," Let's bring him out! Councilman, come on out!"
Councilman Dexhart,"Hi, sweetie."
Leslie Knope, Why didn't you tell me he was gonna be here?
Joan Callamezzo,I thought it'd be more exciting!
Councilman Dexhart,You look great.
Joan Callamezzo, It's like I'm invisible.
Ron Swanson," Okay, my name is Ron."
Ron Swanson, You don't need to know my last name.
Ron Swanson," Whoever wants to talk, go ahead, and we'll be out of here in a tight 15."
Gretel," I found a sandwich in one of your parks, and I want to know why it didn't have mayonnaise."
Gretel, What's so funny?
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Extra," Yeah, I don't think kids should be allowed on the playground equipment."
Ron Swanson, Okay.
Ron Swanson, We've been over this.
Ron Swanson," If you're worried about swine flu, use hand sanitizer--"
Extra,I'm not worried about swine flu.
Extra, I already have the swine flu.
Extra, I'm worried about the turtle flu.
Ron Swanson, The turtle flu?
Extra,Turtle flu.
Ron Swanson, Turtle flu.
Councilman Dexhart," Joan, this whole Pawnee Sun story is ""gotcha journalism"" at its worst."
Councilman Dexhart," Honey, let's just keep our private life in the bedroom where it belongs."
Leslie Knope," We do not have a private life! Stop saying that we have a private life! The fact is, we never slept together, and if we did, you would have proof, and we would have seen it by now."
Joan Callamezzo, Councilman?
Councilman Dexhart,I can prove it.
Councilman Dexhart, She has a mole on her right buttock.
Leslie Knope, What? That is a total lie.
Leslie Knope, You've never seen my butt.
Leslie Knope, What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,He has never seen my butt.
Joan Callamezzo," Well, I guess it's your word against his."
Councilman Dexhart, That's right.
Leslie Knope, Fine.
Leslie Knope," Here, Joan."
Leslie Knope, Why don't you look for yourself?
Joan Callamezzo,Is this happening? Wait.
Joan Callamezzo, There's no mole.
Joan Callamezzo, There is no mole.
Joan Callamezzo," This exclusive story, there is no mole on Miss Knope!"
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it's come to this.
Leslie Knope, This is utterly humiliating.
Joan Callamezzo," Well, Councilman? Care to make a comment about No-Mole-Gate?"
Councilman Dexhart,Yes.
Councilman Dexhart," I really didn't think that Miss Knope would pull down her pants on TV, but since she did, I will admit that the rumors of our affair are indeed false."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Councilman Dexhart," However, I have no plans to resign."
Leslie Knope," Oh, great."
Leslie Knope," Okay, Councilman."
Leslie Knope, You know what? You're a class act.
Councilman Dexhart, Thank you.
Dave Sanderson, I thought you did great.
Dave Sanderson," When you get all feisty like that, it gets my heart racing."
Dave Sanderson," Like I'm on a Stairmaster, except more, like, in a sexual... Context."
Leslie Knope, I can't go to San Diego with you.
Leslie Knope, My life is here.
Leslie Knope," My friends, my career."
Dave Sanderson," I guess I just thought with everything that happened, you'd want a fresh start."
Leslie Knope, I know.
Leslie Knope," I really care about you, Dave."
Leslie Knope, I just-- I love this town.
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope, You want your ticket back?
Dave Sanderson,No.
Dave Sanderson, You know what? Keep it.
Dave Sanderson," You may want to come visit me, right? There's a 75 dollar change fee, but I could pay you that, or I could reimburse you."
Dave Sanderson, There's a lot of ways we could handle that.
Andy Dwyer, Oh! Oh! That's--
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope, Sorry I'm late.
Tom Haverford, Hey!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Honey.
Marlene Griggs-Knope," Honey, I'm so proud of you."
Tom Haverford, Leslie Knope!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"That took guts, mooning Joan Callamezzo! Aw! Honey!"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Leslie Knope," Oh, God! Is something wrong with the tree?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford, Nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope, But it's almost 9:00.
Leslie Knope, It should've been lighted up an hour ago.
Ron Swanson, We waited for you.
Ron Swanson," Okay, everybody."
Ron Swanson, Count down.
All, Five! Four! Three! Two! One! 
Leslie Knope, It's gotten a lot harder to work in government.
Leslie Knope, You think Winston Churchill ever had to pull his pants down and show his butt? No.
Leslie Knope, But would he have? Yes.
Leslie Knope," Now, could he have? Well, maybe not towards the end of his life, but he would have."
Leslie Knope, Because he loved his job.
Andy Dwyer, Reggie Wayne!
Ann Perkins,Dude! You remembered me complaining about my computer bag!
Mark Brendanawicz,Do you like it?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's perfect."
Ann Perkins, It's way better than the gift that I got you.
Ann Perkins, It's Pacers tickets.
Mark Brendanawicz, Oh!
Ann Perkins,They're not even good seats!
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Mark Brendanawicz, This is awesome!
Ann Perkins,It's not awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz, I actually got you a second gift.
Mark Brendanawicz, You don't have to come to this game with me.
Mark Brendanawicz, You don't have to.
Ann Perkins, That's the nicest gift anybody's ever gotten me in my life!
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that good?
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that good?
Mark Brendanawicz,Come here.
Ron Swanson," Oh, thank God!"
Ron Swanson,There's a bunch of messages waiting for you about a bunch of things I don't understand.

Ron Swanson,Potential problem.
Ron Swanson,"The previous owner of Lot 48, Norquist Properties, is claiming the government screwed them by illegally seizing the land."
Leslie Knope,I know about this issue.
Leslie Knope,"I called the city attorney, like, 50 times."
Leslie Knope,He didn't call me back.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, do you need a lawyer?"
Ann Perkins,Because my friend Justin's a lawyer.
Ann Perkins,I'm sure he could help.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that'd be terrific."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I'll call him.
Ann Perkins,Justin's the greatest guy ever.
Mark Brendanawicz,"""The greatest guy ever""?"

George MacFayden,I wanted to talk to you about the amount of snow in the parks.
Ron Swanson,"I've been getting a lot of visitors recently, thanks to a stupid and worthless new push to make government officials more accessible to the public."
Extra,There is a disturbing lack of benches in Ramsett Park!
Extra,I want to sit more!
Extra,And another thing I like is the layout of the hiking trails.
Extra,I made this in one of your pottery classes.

Ann Perkins,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,"All right, so Tom, here's your chicken caesar salad, no dressing, no cheese, no croutons, no taste."
Tom Haverford,And no carbs.
Ann Perkins,"And for you madam, the Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"I can not believe the cafeteria named a sandwich after you, that is so cool."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,Salami on pumpernickel with olice juice and extra iceberg.
Leslie Knope,It was the only sandwich on the board that wasn't named.
Leslie Knope,I just wish I liked it.
Ann Perkins,So how are you feeling about the whole Dave situation?
Leslie Knope,"I really miss him. Yeah, I'm just trying to enjoy the memories."
Ann Perkins,"Aw, that's a sweet picture."
Leslie Knope,"I know, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,"I asked the police department if I could have it, and they said no, so I stole it."
Ann Perkins,I have an idea. Why don't you let me set you up?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, it feels a little too soon."
Ann Perkins,"I'm telling you, this is the best way to get over someone."
Ann Perkins,Just get back on that horse.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe."
Ann Perkins,I feel sorry for Leslie.
Ann Perkins,It's really hard to end a relationship because of distance.
Ann Perkins,"Although, that's pretty much why I broke up with Andy."
Ann Perkins,He lived way too close to me.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, 12:15! You're early today."
Jerry Gergich,"April, there's no paper in the printer."
April Ludgate,So?
Jerry Gergich,So that's the one thing you do.
Ron Swanson,Attention.
Ron Swanson,"April, stop doing that."
April Ludgate,"Jerry told me to, so it's super crucial."
Ron Swanson,More important and more important than anything in this godforsaken world is finding me an assistant.
Tom Haverford,You get an assistant now?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I've always been able to have one, but I've turned it down because it's a waste of money."
Ron Swanson,"In the eight years I've had this job, I've saved the taxpayers of this city more than 150 grand."
Ron Swanson,"But now, I need the taxpayers' money to save me from the taxpayers."
Ron Swanson,Post this at your college.
April Ludgate,This looks like an ad for nothing.
Ron Swanson,"Please be careful with it, it's my only copy."
Justin,Leslie?
Justin,"Ann's friend, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, yeah, of course!"
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming in.
Justin,It's my pleasure.
Justin,Not a problem.
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Justin,"I should warn you, land seizure isn't really my specialty, but I'm happy to take a look."
Justin,Any friend of Ann's--
Leslie Knope,Is a friend of mine!
Leslie Knope,"That's my motto, too."
Leslie Knope,"So, what is your specialty?"
Leslie Knope,Is it locking up the bad guys or keeping them on the streets?
Justin,Neither.
Justin,"Civil litigation, mostly."
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Justin,It can be.
Justin,I've got this crazy case-- Have you ever heard of this product Fire in a Can?
Leslie Knope,"Ah, I love those commercials!"
Leslie Knope,"If you want to start a fire, But you have to do it fast--"
Justin,"Well, you shouldn't buy it."
Justin,It'll literally burn your hand clean off.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Justin,Mmmhmm.
Justin,It is an aerosol can with an igniter and a trigger.
Justin,"It's essentially a blowtorch, and if you can believe it, it was invented to warm up baby bottles."
Leslie Knope,"This is my colleague, Tom Haverford."
Justin,Tom.
Justin,Justin.
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Tom Haverford,"You are wearing the hell out of that suit, sir."
Tom Haverford,"Banana, two button."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go into the conference room."
Leslie Knope,I've got everything laid out.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, stop."
Tom Haverford,We should talk later.
Justin,"You are very organized, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I am."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Justin,I love what you do.
Justin,You have the coolest job.
Justin,Let me guess.
Justin,This is our park.
Justin,I want to know everything about this.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, these green things represent trees."
April Ludgate,"I come in, like, two hours late because I had to finish watching Swimfan because it was on, and everyone, like, jumped down my throat."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man."
April Ludgate,I can't wait till my internship is over so I can get the hell out of here.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you're all set."
Andy Dwyer,"Free of charge, of course."
April Ludgate,"Hey, why don't you sell your band's CDs here?"
Andy Dwyer,That is a brilliant idea.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot believe I didn't think of that.
Andy Dwyer,I have been writing a lot of songs about shining shoes lately.
Andy Dwyer,I tend to write about what I'm doing.
Andy Dwyer,"Talking about writing about what I'm doing, Now I'm singing about talking about writing about what I'm doing"
Justin,"Of course I'm gonna have to take a closer look at these things, but my gut's telling me this is not gonna be a big deal."
Justin,Companies make bogus claims like this all the time.
Justin,I think you're gonna be just fine.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,I know you're really busy.
Justin,"Please, my pleasure."
Justin,"At least this stuff is interesting, you know?"
Justin,"You know, it actually reminds me, two years ago, I was in Borneo officiating a wedding, and this enormous medicine man showed up and he was there to basically tell--"
Ann Perkins,Justin!
Justin,"Hey, kiddo!"
Justin,How you doing?
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,I'm good.
Ann Perkins,I haven't seen you in forever!
Justin,I know!
Justin,It's so good to see you.
Ann Perkins,"You, too."
Ann Perkins,Do you want to grab some dinner?
Justin,"Uh, I would love to."
Justin,I cannot.
Justin,I am swamped.
Ann Perkins,You're always so busy.
Justin,Yeah.
Justin,"Next week, I promise."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, I'm Mark."
Ann Perkins,Sorry!
Justin,"Hey, Mark."
Ann Perkins,"Justin, this is Mark."
Ann Perkins,This is the city planner.
Justin,"Oh, my God!"
Justin,It's such a pleasure to meet you.
Mark Brendanawicz,Pleasure.
Justin,Pleasure.
Justin,"Anyway, Leslie, I have to go."
Justin,It has been a super pleasure meeting you.
Justin,"I am gonna get into this over the weekend, and I will get back to you on Monday about it."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Justin,All right.
Tom Haverford,"See you, Justin!"
Justin,"Okay, Tom."
Justin,Good seeing you.
Leslie Knope,I've been thinking.
Leslie Knope,"It has been a while since Dave left, and I think I might be ready to start dating again."
Ann Perkins,That's great!
Leslie Knope,"You know, I was only with Mark for one night, and then I was hung up on him for six years."
Leslie Knope,"I dated Dave for three months, so if I continue that pattern, I won't be over him for... Five hundred years."
Ann Perkins,What is your ideal man?
Leslie Knope,He has the brains of George Clooney in the body of Joe Biden.
Ann Perkins,Interesting.
Ann Perkins,"That's a, high weird bar."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Just off the bat, there's a couple of doctors I think you would love."
Leslie Knope,Actually I was thinking…
Leslie Knope,What about Justin?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I feel like we kind of hit it off in there."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I don't, I just don't know if that would be the right fit."
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Is there something wrong with him?
Ann Perkins,"No, no, he's really, really, really great, and you're so great, obviously."
Ann Perkins,I just... I don't... I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"It's hard, I can't… I can't put…"
Leslie Knope,What is it though?
Ann Perkins,"I don't know, it's just… I don't think it would be…"
Leslie Knope,I think it would. No?
Ann Perkins,"No, I really don't."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, I don't…"
Leslie Knope,"Don't be sorry, I mean, if you think it wasn't gonna work, or…"
Ann Perkins,"But I will find you someone, I promise, and he'll be awesome."
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go do it right now.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good, great, yes!"
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ann, go!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, just one rule."
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to date a twin, 'cause I've been tricked before."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I understand your complaint.
Ron Swanson,I have to go now.
Ron Swanson,Please.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,Ron Solo!
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Tom."
Tom Haverford,I want to help you with your assistant search.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Tom Haverford,Just want to do my boy Ron a solid.
Tom Haverford,"I know exactly what you're looking for, and I will find you a reliable person."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, sounds good."
Tom Haverford,"How do you know that was a member of the public, and not just a friend?"
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, my friends know that I have a strict no call policy."
Ron Swanson,Now get out there and find me an assistant.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I left you three messages.
Ann Perkins,Did you get them?
Leslie Knope,"No, I've been running around all day."
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Ann Perkins,"I found the perfect guy to set you up with, but he's going out of town, so he can only do tonight, so I came over here right after work."
Leslie Knope,Is that his blood?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, damn, now I have to go back."
Leslie Knope,Who is he?
Ann Perkins,"His name is Chris and he's an MRI technician, and he's really cute, and he's very passionate about his job, and I told him all about you, and he's really interested."
Ann Perkins,"So, dinner tonight, and here's the info."
Leslie Knope,Thanks!
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,How's he gonna know it's me?
Leslie Knope,I'll wear a red rose in my hair.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'll wear a giant red hat."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have one of those."
Leslie Knope,What should I wear?
Leslie Knope,It's gotta be red.
Ann Perkins,I will just tell him what you look like.
Leslie Knope,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Are you Chris?
Chris,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.
Chris,"Oh, don't worry about it."
Chris,You look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Chris,"Oh, here, let me take your coat."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Chris,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Well done, Ann."
Chris,I actually heard that.
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris,"Well, I went to Wisconsin for both undergrad and grad school."
Chris,Go Badgers!
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,Indiana Hoosiers!
Chris,No.
Chris,Badgers.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's not important.
Leslie Knope,I'm just glad that we could make this happen.
Chris,"Ann kept going on about how wonderful you are, and I just had to see for myself."
Leslie Knope,"Well, she's my number one best friend."
Chris,"I wish she'd told me that you went to Indiana, but whatever."
Chris,"So, you're in charge of amusement parks, right?"
Chris,"God, that's exciting!"
Leslie Knope,"Actually, it's regular parks."
Leslie Knope,Like swings and slides and stuff.
Chris,Strike two.
Leslie Knope,"You know, isn't it funny how these setups are always just so awkward?"
Chris,Why would you say that?
Leslie Knope,I don't… I don't know. They're not. Forget it.
Chris,Way to go Chris. Did I just make it awkward?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, you didn't."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, you kind of did."
Leslie Knope,"Let's just start from the beginning, I guess."
Chris,"Hey, watch this."
Chris,I will now extinguish this candle with my bare hand.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris,That really hurt!
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Chris,"Oh, God!"
Chris,It looked so much easier on the Internet.
Chris,"God, I gotta borrow some of your ice!"
Chris,"Oh, no, thanks, I'm not thirsty."
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,German?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"All right, later."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Was that, uh, Justin?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,We are going to lunch tomorrow.
Mark Brendanawicz,Oh get out. How long have you known him?
Ann Perkins,Forever. He practically saved my life.
Ann Perkins,"He was like, the only cool dude at my high school."
Mark Brendanawicz,Awesome.
Mark Brendanawicz,Did you guys ever date?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,We never did.
Ann Perkins,"He's just, like, a really amazing person."
Ann Perkins,Let's do this!
Mark Brendanawicz,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Marley and Me!
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's do it.
Ann Perkins,"Puppies, puppies, puppies!"
Mark Brendanawicz,I know.
Mark Brendanawicz,Let's watch Marley and Me.
Tom Haverford,Brian.
Tom Haverford,"Technically, you'd be assisting Ron, but Ron really doesn't do much government work, so you'd really be working for me."
Tom Haverford,"I see your resume here. Education, exellent. Awesome professional experience."
Tom Haverford,But I don't care.
Tom Haverford,I'm interested in real world expertise.
Tom Haverford,I got a nightclub opening to go to.
Tom Haverford,Which tie do I wear?
Brian,I like the one on the left.
Tom Haverford,That was a trick question.
Tom Haverford,The answer's this one.
Brian,I didn't even know that one existed.
Tom Haverford,I had high hopes wen I saw your plum V neck.
Tom Haverford,But those hopes have been dashed. You can leave.
Chris,"You ever see that movie, The Matrix?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Chris,99% real.
Leslie Knope,"So, do you enjoy it, being an MRI technician?"
Chris,Great question.
Chris,Someone steps into the room.
Chris,"Imagine a mother of three, maybe she's a teacher."
Chris,"She knows something's wrong, but she doesn't know what it is."
Chris,She's scared.
Chris,"In less than an hour, I know what it is."
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with her?
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,"But the best part about being an MRI technician is, I can see inside everything."
Chris,See that guy over there?
Chris,Imagine being able to look inside his head.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Chris,I know.
Chris,"You could look inside this steak or you could look inside this butter or these potatoes, or this candle, or this beer, or this flower, or this bread."
Chris,You can look inside anything.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread."
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,I'd have to do an MRI.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,This… it's just bread in there.
Chris,"Yeah, but what's inside that bread? Could be cheese."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, it's good that you found your calling."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've never even had an MRI before."
Chris,What?
Leslie Knope,I don't know about this.
Chris,"Well, I'm offering you a free scan."
Chris,"It usually costs up to 2,000 dollars."
Chris,I'm kind of spoiling you here.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am a little curious."
Chris,Good.
Chris,"Frankly, I don't want to invest in someone who only has three months to live."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe someday we'll tell our grandkids how weird our first date was and how creepy their grandfather was.
Chris,Try not to smile too much. It'll affect the diagnosis.
Leslie Knope,Well hopefully there'll be nothing to diagnose.
Chris,"Sometimes smiling is read as ""AIDS."""
Chris,"Oh, you're not on your period, are you?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Does that matter?
Chris,"Well, not for this."
Chris,Okay.
Chris,It's gonna be a little crammed in there.
Chris,"Don't worry, I'll be right on the other side of that glass."
Tom Haverford,Scenario.
Tom Haverford,I meet a girl at a bar.
Tom Haverford,"She seems kind of into me, could go either way."
Tom Haverford,"I get her number, it's two days later, what do I text her?"
Zack,"""It was nice meeting you."""
Tom Haverford,"No, Zack!"
Tom Haverford,"I don't text her, ""It was nice meeting you."""
Tom Haverford,"I wait eight weeks and I text her, ""What's cracking?"""
Tom Haverford,"Your resume's very impressive, but tell me about you."
Tom Haverford,Tell me about your friends.
Tom Haverford,Be as superficial as possible.
Tom Haverford,Just your basic assistant stuff.
Tom Haverford,"Taking messages, wakeup calls, Muscle Milk runs, condom runs, bottle service at the Snakehole Lounge, covering for me in any legally dicey situations."
Extra,Sorry.
Extra,What do I get out of this?
Tom Haverford,Connections.
Tom Haverford,"Plus 19 grand a year, minus my 10% headhunters' fee."
Extra,I have to pay you two grand if I get hired?
Tom Haverford,I have a job to offer.
Tom Haverford,"In the immortal words of Rod Blagojevich, ""It's a [bleep] valuable thing."""
Tom Haverford,"""You just don't give it away for nothing."""
Chris,"All right, Leslie. You're going to start hearing some loud noises and see some flashing lights."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris,So you never told me where you're from.
Leslie Knope,I'm from Pawnee.
Chris,"Keep still, please."
Chris,"And you said that your mom works in government, too, is that right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes she does.
Chris,"You gotta keep still. No talking, Leslie."
Chris,What kind of music do you like?
Leslie Knope,Can I answer that?
Chris,Sure.
Chris,Keep still.
Leslie Knope,All kinds.
Chris,"Very important that you keep still at this moment, Leslie."
Chris,I've told you that a thousand times.
Chris,Did you ever break your arm?
Chris,You can answer that.
Chris,"Here, I'll turn it off."
Leslie Knope,"One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control."
Leslie Knope,I'm surprised you can see that.
Leslie Knope,"It was, like, three years ago."
Chris,I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.
Chris,"You never had any kids, right, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Chris,You've got a great oven.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, time to go."
Chris,You got ample room in there.
Chris,"Honestly, if you wanted to, you could go triplets right off the bat, Leslie."
Chris,"You got a big, industrial-sized oven."
Leslie Knope,"So we're done, right?"
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Ann Perkins,How's the date going?
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,We just finished the MRI.
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts."
Leslie Knope,"I don't mean to offend you, you know? I know he's your friend."
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not offended at all. I don't know him that well."
Leslie Knope,Why would you think he'd be perfect for me then?
Ann Perkins,"Well, he seemed great."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Les."
Ann Perkins,"I'll find you somebody else, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Just don't let this sour you on dating.
Ann Perkins,"Like, what you're doing is really healthy, so keep the faith, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Chris,Hey!
Chris,No cell phones!
Chris,Don't touch that.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Chris,Just take your hands off it.
Mark Brendanawicz,What was that about?
Ann Perkins,I set Leslie up on a date.
Ann Perkins,I don't think it's going that well.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, no."
Mark Brendanawicz,With Justin?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,This guy I know from the hospital.
Mark Brendanawicz,Why wouldn't you set her up with Justin?
Ann Perkins,I don't really see them together.
Ann Perkins,You know?
Ann Perkins,"Plus, Leslie just got out of a relationship, so I didn't want Justin to be, like, her rebound guy or anything, you know?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, that makes sense."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.
Ann Perkins,Why are we talking about this?
Mark Brendanawicz,We're not.
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
Chris,Well it actually all looks pretty good.
Chris,You've got a large brain.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Chris,Yeah.
Chris,"Well, it looks pretty... Hang on."
Chris,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What's weird?
Chris,Your brain.
Chris,See that shadow right there?
Chris,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Is that bad?
Chris,I don't know.
Chris,I'd have a doctor look at that immediately if I were you.
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?
Chris,"Oh, wait."
Chris,Oh.
Chris,"It's, like, a smudge or something."
Chris,We almost wheeled you out of here on a chair.
Leslie Knope,Should we go?
Chris,"Yeah, we should go."
Chris,Can you imagine if you had to spend the rest of your life sipping a steak through a straw?
Chris,That almost happened to you. You were a smudge away.
Chris,Thank God I was here.
Chris,Looks like we make a pretty good team.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm sorry, but there's just something weird about the way you talk about him."
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,There was definitely times when we thought maybe we would go out someday.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's why you didn't set Leslie up.
Mark Brendanawicz,Because you're saving him.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, yeah, you are."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine."
Ann Perkins,"You don't have someone in your life that you think, ""I don't know, maybe if things were different, maybe, some day..."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"If I'm late for dinner one night, you're gonna dump me for Dustin?"
Ann Perkins,"No, no. Justin."
Mark Brendanawicz,Justin?
Ann Perkins,"Absolutely not, but if we break up or you die tragically in a city planning accident and I wait a respectful amount of time, I don't know. Maybe…"
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what?
Mark Brendanawicz,You can't save somebody for the future while you're in a relationship.
Mark Brendanawicz,Even I know that.
Chris,"So, did you want to go back to your place?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date."
Chris,I get it.
Chris,"Get your MRI and get out, huh?"
Leslie Knope,This was your idea.
Chris,Clever lady.
Chris,I guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.
Chris,I should have noticed that you're missing a heart.
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Chris,"Goodbye, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,I drove us here.
Leslie Knope,Goodie.
Chris,"Hey, do you mind if we pick up my son Nate at his basketball game on the way back?"
Tom Haverford,"So, how was the big date?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, the good news is I don't have cancer."
Leslie Knope,The bad news is I got an MRI bill for 2000 dollars.
Tom Haverford,That sounds hot.
Leslie Knope,I just don't understand why the hell Ann thought we'd be a good fit.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, you slept together?"
Leslie Knope,"What? Not sexually. God, what's wrong with you, Tom?"
Justin,This a bad time?
Leslie Knope,"No, come on in."
Tom Haverford,Justin!
Justin,"What's up, brother?"
Leslie Knope,Should we…?
Justin,"Yeah, let's do."
Tom Haverford,See you dude.
Justin,"See you around, brother."
Tom Haverford,Dope pea coat.
Tom Haverford,I have the same one in an extra small.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, well, well. Look who's bothering who now?"
Andy Dwyer,Seems like the shot is on the other foot.
Andy Dwyer,And the guuy who polishes shoes is now me.
Andy Dwyer,What up? What can I do for ya?
Mark Brendanawicz,"When you were dating Ann, did you know this guy Justin?"
Andy Dwyer," Oh, Justin?"
Andy Dwyer, I hate Justin.
Andy Dwyer, Ann was so obviously into him.
Andy Dwyer, It was so annoying.
Mark Brendanawicz, Right.
Andy Dwyer," I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with, Justin's up here, I'm up here, and then you're down here."
Mark Brendanawicz," Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy, so, naturally, I came to you for reassurance."
Mark Brendanawicz, Do me a favor.
Mark Brendanawicz, Don't tell Ann that we talked about this.
Andy Dwyer, Will do.
Andy Dwyer, Ann Perkins! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Andy Dwyer, What you're doing to Mark is not cool.
Ann Perkins, Why are you guys talking to each other? You know what? Forget it.
Ann Perkins, I'm not getting into this with you.
April Ludgate, You did something wrong?
Ann Perkins,No! I didn't do anything wrong.
Andy Dwyer, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, Come here.
Ann Perkins, This is none of your business.
Ann Perkins, You don't know what you're talking about.
Andy Dwyer," Actually, I do know what I'm talking about."
Andy Dwyer," Every time I used to sit around all afternoon playing video games wearing only my slippers, all of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself, and do you know why?"
Ann Perkins,Didn't you just explain why?
Andy Dwyer,I would feel bad about myself because I would start to think about this perfect guy.
Andy Dwyer," Anytime you would talk about Justin, I didn't feel very important."
Andy Dwyer, That was rough.
Ann Perkins," Well, I didn't know that."
Andy Dwyer," Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left."
Andy Dwyer," But you do know now, so you have to choose."
Andy Dwyer, It's either me or Justin.
Ann Perkins, I'm not gonna choose.
Ann Perkins, Wait.
Ann Perkins, I'm dating Mark!
Andy Dwyer,"Are you, though?"
Ann Perkins,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Ah! That close.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,"""Cease and desist."""
Leslie Knope,"""Burden of proof."""
Leslie Knope,Very forceful language. I'm a little scared.
Justin,Check out paragraph two.
Justin,I drop the F bomb.
Leslie Knope,"""Frivolous."""
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Justin,"Definitely have the city attorney look at that, but that should be enough to do the trick."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Justin, I just... I can't thank you enough."
Justin,It's my pleasure.
Justin,Maybe I'll see you around sometime.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,I would love... Mmmhmm.
Justin,I'll see you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Justin,Bye.
Donna Meagle,Damn!
Donna Meagle,He is all right.
Donna Meagle,Why don't you hit that?
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, I would like to hit that, but Ann's being a little weird about it."
Donna Meagle,Maybe she's got him on hold.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford," Ronald, I've done it."
Tom Haverford," I've found your assistant, and he's dope."
Tom Haverford, His name is Jean-Ralphio.
Tom Haverford, Jean-Ralphio!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Big T.
Tom Haverford, What up?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Mr. Swanson, two things."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," One, it is an absolute honor to meet you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Two, who is that hot intern chick out there? Because honestly, damn!"
Ron Swanson,Take a seat.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Right.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Here we go.
Ron Swanson," So, Jean-Ralphio…"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You got him right here.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Leave a message after the beep.
Ron Swanson, Why do I want you as my assistant?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"For starters, access to the illest clubs."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, And that's just for starters.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I will work for you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I'll be on you 24/ 7.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I'll be like your family.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I'm here when you get here in the morning.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Sure enough, I'll be there tucking you into bed at night."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Don't worry, it's not gay."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Do we have questions?
Tom Haverford,"I think our only question is, when can you start?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Right now, let's do it!"
Ron Swanson,Thank you for coming in.
Ron Swanson, We will talk.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Cool.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I feel good about this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," And, you know, you can hit me up on Facebook anytime, day or night."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," You know that, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Take care, buddy."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Boom.
Tom Haverford, So what do you think of your new assistant?
Ron Swanson,I want to punch you in the face so bad right now.
Tom Haverford, What?
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford, Message received.
Tom Haverford, I'll keep looking.
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
Ron Swanson, Bring me the opposite of him.
April Ludgate,Tell me what Ann did wrong. Please. I need to know.
Andy Dwyer,"Nothing, it's none of my business."
Extra, What kind of music is this?
Andy Dwyer,"It's rock and roll, my friend."
Andy Dwyer,The kind that sticks in your brain.
Andy Dwyer,"Loud, fast, smooth, handsome rock."
April Ludgate, That band is really blowing up right now.
April Ludgate, They're number one on iTunes.
Extra, Okay.
Extra, I'll take one.
Andy Dwyer, You are amazing! I like when you hang out here.
April Ludgate, I want to be your assistant.
Ron Swanson, Really? You hate it here.
April Ludgate, So do you.
April Ludgate, I'll make sure you don't have to go to any meetings.
April Ludgate," If anyone comes to see you, I'll scare them away."
Tom Haverford," Wait, April, if you had to choose between these two ties--"
Ron Swanson,You're hired.
April Ludgate, I just figured I might as well get paid for being here.
Ann Perkins, Hi.
Leslie Knope, Hey! I was just calling you.
Ann Perkins, Here.
Leslie Knope, This is a prescription for Denise Dogan.
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
Ann Perkins, I'm so out of sorts.
Ann Perkins, Here.
Leslie Knope, Porter's Grill at 7:00.
Ann Perkins, Justin's gonna meet you there.
Ann Perkins, I'm sorry Chris was such a jerk.
Ann Perkins, You deserve way better than that.
Leslie Knope, If this situation is weird or if you feel weird--
Ann Perkins,It's not weird.
Ann Perkins, You guys will really like each other.
Leslie Knope, Thanks.
Ann Perkins, I gotta run.
Ann Perkins, I have another stop on the pride swallowing tour of City Hall.
Leslie Knope, Go get him.
Mark Brendanawicz, That's where I never find things.
Ann Perkins, Hey.
Mark Brendanawicz," Hi, Ann."
Ann Perkins," So, I just set up Justin and Leslie."
Ann Perkins, And I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins," I rented District 9, if you maybe wanted to spoil that for me tonight."
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God!"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Dark ending, right?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm back on the horse, and this horse is a lawyer, so I'm looking forward to riding him."
Leslie Knope," No, wait."
Leslie Knope," Ten months ago, she was an intern who could give a C- R- A- P about local government."
Leslie Knope," Now, she's our newest employee."
Leslie Knope, To April!
All,Cheers! Cheers!
April Ludgate,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, come and celebrate!"
Jerry Gergich,"No, thanks."
Leslie Knope," Well, everybody, let's get back to work."
April Ludgate, Where are you going?
Jerry Gergich,I want to talk to Ron about the size of my desk.
April Ludgate," Jerry, you have to schedule an appointment."
Jerry Gergich, Okay.
Jerry Gergich, How about now?
April Ludgate,Ron's not here.
Jerry Gergich, He's right there.
Jerry Gergich, I can see him.
April Ludgate, I'll let you know when he's available.

Leslie Knope,"And it's because of you, our teachers, that every one of these recreation classes in this catalog shines like a jewel in Pawnee's beautiful crown."
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, this year we will have to remove five jewels from that crown."
Tania,Excuse me?
Tania,Are you cutting our classes?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"The city took away 1,000 dollars from our budget."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm very sorry."
Extra,How will you decide which classes to cut?
Leslie Knope,By attendance and student evaluations.
Leslie Knope,"So, just make sure your students leave with a smile."
Extra,"My class is called ""Coping with Terminal Illness."""
Leslie Knope,Hopefully your attendance is good!
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no, hopefully it's bad."
Leslie Knope,Nobody's more upset about this than me.
Leslie Knope,I've been taking these rec center classes since I was in high school.
Leslie Knope,"It's where I learned hair braiding, and how to make biscuits, and French kissing."
Leslie Knope,"The French kissing was just from a boy in my biscuits class, but either way, lesson learned."
Justin,"Oh, my God!"
Justin,You have never been to Carnival?
Leslie Knope,I want to go!
Justin,"We have to get tickets in February to go to Rio de Janeiro, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I am on a date with Justin in Indianapolis.
Leslie Knope,"We've only been out a few times, but every one of them has been amazing."
Justin,Cheers.
Leslie Knope,"Last time, we had a private tour and cocktails at the Indianapolis Aquarium."
Leslie Knope,That fish over there kind of reminds me of my mom.
Justin,Why?
Leslie Knope,It's just being really withholding.
Leslie Knope,Justin is definitely the most interesting guy I've ever dated.
Justin,All I did was a little paperwork.
Chef,"He's being modest, it is thanks to him my family remains in this country."
Chef,And it was all pro bono.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Justin."
Justin,You've got to try this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's really good!"
Justin,Isn't it great?
Justin,It's camel stomach.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Justin,"I'm teasing, I'm teasing."
Justin,It's chicken.
Chef,Would you like to try the camel stomach?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Justin,"So, when am I gonna see you again?"
Justin,Oh!
Justin,"You know what, I'm gonna be near Pawnee on Tuesday."
Leslie Knope,"Excellent, yeah."
Leslie Knope,I'll plan something exciting.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, our date in Pawnee is gonna blow Indianapolis out of the water."
Justin,All right.
Justin,I'm gonna hold you to that.
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,You better.
Justin,I will!
Leslie Knope,I've racked my brain and I can't come up with one exciting idea.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he once ate fried cockatoo with a member of the Thai Royal Family."
Ann Perkins,"Well, maybe just have him over and cook him some chicken and tell him it's Pawnee cockatoo."
Leslie Knope,A dinner party!
Leslie Knope,That's genius.
Leslie Knope,"I'll invite all my most interesting friends over, we'll have this big rambling party."
Ann Perkins,"No, I actually meant more like a one-on-one thing."
Leslie Knope,"I know what you meant, but I took your idea and I made it better."
Leslie Knope,"It's called a think tank, Ann."
Ann Perkins,What is?
Leslie Knope,Our lunches.
Leslie Knope,Our lunches are like think tanks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I want you to come over to my house at 2:00 and help me get ready."
Leslie Knope,And make sure that Mark is coming.
Leslie Knope,So much work to do!
Leslie Knope,You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope,"Now, get out of here!"
Ron Swanson,How many courses will there be?
Leslie Knope,Three.
Ron Swanson,Hmm…
Leslie Knope,Four.
Leslie Knope,Not including dessert.
Ron Swanson,"So, five courses."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Now, it will be five courses."
Ron Swanson,"If I wanted to bring a large number of deviled eggs, but I didn't want to share them with anyone else, can you guarantee fridge space?"
Leslie Knope,Just be there at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Tom!"
Leslie Knope,I'm having an A list dinner party for Justin.
Leslie Knope,"And you, out of all my friends, come from the most distant and exotic land."
Tom Haverford,South Carolina?
Leslie Knope,Save it for the party.
Leslie Knope,Can you make it?
Tom Haverford,For Justin?
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding?
Tom Haverford,I'm there.
Tom Haverford,Just don't invite any boring people like Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,What are you guys talking about?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Check it out.
Andy Dwyer,Just practicing.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that polish gonna get on people's butts when they sit down?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, listen."
Leslie Knope,I'm having a party…
Andy Dwyer,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,And I thought maybe you could help me with serving and taking people's coats.
Leslie Knope,"I'd pay you, like, 10 bucks an hour."
Andy Dwyer,My guardian angel!
Andy Dwyer,I would love to!
Andy Dwyer,Who's going to be there?
Leslie Knope,Really fun people.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Tom, Mark and Ann."
Andy Dwyer,That's great.
Andy Dwyer,What's the occasion?
Leslie Knope,Justin is coming into town.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, it's me, Justin."
Andy Dwyer,Take my coat.
Andy Dwyer,"But please, be careful."
Andy Dwyer,I got it from the king of Africa when we were walking on the Berlin Wall together.
Andy Dwyer,"Really, Justin?"
Andy Dwyer,What instruments do you play?
Andy Dwyer,"Actually, he's a pretty sick keyboardist."
Andy Dwyer,Good.
Andy Dwyer,I'm good to go.
Andy Dwyer,That sounds great.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Andy Dwyer,I'll see you there.
Kyle,"Afternoon, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,"You know, right before you sat down, I noticed, did you have some kind of stain on your ass, or something?"
Andy Dwyer,What was that?
Kyle,What?
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,You're good.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to my house, for the very first time."
Ann Perkins,I know!
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you've never had me over.
Ann Perkins,"Now, I can believe it."
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,It's a little messy.
Leslie Knope,But I have a system.
Leslie Knope,"So, I just need you to help me put the finishing touches on everything."
Ann Perkins,"This newspaper's from November, 1986."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the first rumblings of Iran Contra!"
Leslie Knope,Don't throw that out!
Ann Perkins,I think I need to call Child Services and have Leslie taken away from herself.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, don't take this the wrong way, but your house is like a crazy person's garage."
Ann Perkins,What do you need this birdhouse for?
Ann Perkins,Can we get rid of it?
Leslie Knope,I might need it.
Ann Perkins,What about this one?
Leslie Knope,"Well, if two birds come along?"
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Andy's gonna come over soon, he can help us with all this stuff."
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,You need a team of professionals to help.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, is this Maria Portlesman from ""Organize Your Life, with Maria Portlesman""?"
Tom Haverford,"April, come here."
April Ludgate,What?
Tom Haverford,Shake my hand.
April Ludgate,Why?
Tom Haverford,I can't tell if I've exfoliated too much.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to creep Justin out.
Tom Haverford,I want him to respect my handshake.
April Ludgate,Why do you care about him?
Tom Haverford,Justin is hip.
Tom Haverford,Pawnee is the opposite of hip.
Tom Haverford,People in this town are just now getting into Nirvana.
Tom Haverford,I don't have the heart to tell them what's going to happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Justin."
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,It's like touching raw chicken.
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Gonna have to refoliate them.
Maria Portlesman,"I'll need some help moving the boxes, but it's doable."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,How much do I owe you?
Maria Portlesman,Please.
Maria Portlesman,No charge.
Maria Portlesman,I just appreciate the chance to demonstrate how valuable my class is to the rec center.
Maria Portlesman,And I hope you'll keep that in mind.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I insist on paying."
Maria Portlesman,"No, no, I insist on demonstrating."
Leslie Knope,This is not gonna affect my decision at all.
Maria Portlesman,"Oh, of course not."
Leslie Knope,Stop winking.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, I forgot to ask you."
Ann Perkins,What are you cooking?
Leslie Knope,Five courses.
Ann Perkins,Of what?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Ann Perkins,Of what?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"So, how's it looking?"
Leslie Knope,It smells great.
Tania,"Okay, the appetizers are almost ready."
Tania,"And I think that they are a very good sampling of what my level one class does, which I hope you'll keep in mind when you're making your decisions."
Leslie Knope,"Tania, like I said over the phone--"
Tania,I know.
Tania,It won't influence your decision.
Tania,It's just that learning to cook is very important in this day and age.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Are you gonna be all right, tonight?"
Andy Dwyer,"What, 'cause of Mark and Justin?"
Andy Dwyer,They are just guests at a really awesome dinner party.
Andy Dwyer,And I will treat them as such.
Leslie Knope,That sounds very professional.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"I promise I will not spit in anyone's food, unless they should request that I do."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Andy Dwyer,Did I do this right?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my humble abode.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, thank you."
Mark Brendanawicz,Whoa!
Mark Brendanawicz,This is way cleaner than the last time I was here.
Ann Perkins,You've been here?
Ann Perkins,Right.
Andy Dwyer,When was Mark here before?
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Sex.
Mark Brendanawicz,I can't wait to talk to Justin again.
Mark Brendanawicz,Last time he told me about how he snorkeled with whale sharks in Madagascar.
Mark Brendanawicz,That was after I told him that I sometimes go swimming at the Y.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, thank you, son."
Ron Swanson,Leslie Knope.
Ron Swanson,I believe you've arranged accommodations for these.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron Swanson."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You didn't happen to hear about the incident with Mayor Gunderson's dog, did you?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,It was a blood bath--
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no!"
Leslie Knope,No talking.
Leslie Knope,Everybody stop talking until Justin gets here.
Leslie Knope,Don't use up your stories.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I think somebody from Animal Services is gonna get canned."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What part of not talking do you not understand?
Leslie Knope,"Please, have a good time and shut your mouth."
Leslie Knope,I just want this dinner party to go well.
Leslie Knope,There are very few things I've asked for in this world.
Leslie Knope,To build a new park from scratch.
Leslie Knope,To eventually become president.
Leslie Knope,And to one day solve a murder on a train.
Leslie Knope,I think it's fair to add this to the list.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Justin's here!"
Leslie Knope,That's Justin.
Leslie Knope,Everybody start talking.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Justin,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Justin,Sorry I'm a little bit late.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,Welcome to my very interesting party.
Justin,Andy Dwyer!
Justin,Can't wait to catch up with this guy.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Justin."
Andy Dwyer,"May I take your coat, sir?"
Justin,"Why, yeah."
Justin,Thank you.
Justin,"I can't wait, I'm gonna get to hang out with all your friends tonight."
Leslie Knope,"I know, it's gonna be super fun."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a blast.
Leslie Knope,"Really, really, just like the best, most exciting night of your life."
Leslie Knope,I cannot overhype it enough.
Justin,All right.
Justin,Let's get started!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, J?"
Justin,"How you doing, man?"
Justin,How are you?
Justin,Justin.
April Ludgate,I have the swine flu.
Justin,Oh--
Leslie Knope,"No, she doesn't."
April Ludgate,Yo.
Andy Dwyer,Yo.
April Ludgate,Is that Justin's coat?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Isn't it awesome?
Andy Dwyer,"He got it in Cambodia, when he was hiking Mount Everest."
April Ludgate,Let's put chewed up gum in his pockets.
Andy Dwyer,That's genius.
Andy Dwyer,But I can't.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie's being super cool to me, and I can't screw over her boyfriend's jacket."
April Ludgate,I'll do it when you're not in the room then.
Andy Dwyer,That would be terrible.
Andy Dwyer,I'm being sarcastic.
Andy Dwyer,That would be awesome.
Justin,"God, India is so amazing."
Justin,Let me tell you something.
Justin,That is my absolute favorite place to travel.
Justin,Where did you say your parents were from?
Tom Haverford,The south part.
Leslie Knope,The southern part's always the best part of anything.
Justin,"Have you ever been to the Kaniman Mosque, down in Tamil Nadu?"
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding?
Tom Haverford,My uncle practically runs the place.
Tom Haverford,I've prayed there.
Tom Haverford,It's sick.
Justin,"Tell me everything, right now."
Tom Haverford,"One sec, I just got to hit the loo, as those bastard British lmperialists would say."
Tom Haverford,"The last time I was in India, I was eight years old and I stayed inside the whole time playing video games."
Tom Haverford,I got to bone up.
Tom Haverford,Fourth largest coal reserves in the world.
Ron Swanson,This is the best Old Fashioned I have ever had.
Ron Swanson,Where'd you find this bartender?
Leslie Knope,"Oh I think, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,"Like, maybe the Yellow Pages."
Ron Swanson,There's no way that you're paying him enough.
Bartender,"Well, if you want, I could teach you the secret to great--"
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get over here!"
Ann Perkins,I'm here.
Ann Perkins,Already.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, do you think this party's going well?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, can you see Justin?"
Leslie Knope,Is he having fun?
Ann Perkins,Justin is over there talking to Mark.
Ann Perkins,Happily.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good."
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna casually make my--
Mark Brendanawicz,"So my face is literally on fire, but it's this weird chemical, so no one can see the flames."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm dancing around, freaking out."
Mark Brendanawicz,I end up having to dunk my face into a bucket of sand.
Justin,Unreal!
Leslie Knope,Unreal!
Justin,"Oh, my God, that is unbelievable."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's... Isn't it, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Unbelievable.
Mark Brendanawicz,Didn't happen to me.
Mark Brendanawicz,It was a kid I knew from camp.
Mark Brendanawicz,But a great story's a great story.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, plus, the kid can't tell it, his mouth melted."
Leslie Knope,Dinner is served!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Excellent!
Wendy,Hey.
Wendy,I'm sorry.
Wendy,Are we late?
Tom Haverford,What the hell are you doing?
Tom Haverford,How could you invite Wendy when Ron's here?
Tom Haverford,He's gonna wrap her up in his moustache and take her home.
Leslie Knope,"We agreed that we should invite interesting people for Justin, and Wendy is an interesting person!"
Leslie Knope,I've been telling you for weeks that you should tell her how you feel.
Leslie Knope,Now's your chance!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.
Tom Haverford,"No, it doesn't!"
Tom Haverford,"Not cool, at all!"
Leslie Knope,He'll get over it.
Tom Haverford,"No, I won't."
Tania,The first course is a Mexican bean soup.
Ron Swanson,Are these peppers for consuming?
Tania,I wouldn't.
Tania,They're very hot.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna give it a try.
Ron Swanson,Hot.
Wendy,You're very brave.
Tom Haverford,"Please, that was one of the tiny ones."
Tom Haverford,This is how you eat it!
Ron Swanson,"Don't do that, Tom!"
Tom Haverford,"Mm, [bleep]."
Leslie Knope,"This is something, Justin."
Leslie Knope,"Derek and Ben are gay, but often, on occasion, April will have relations with Derek."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Crazy stuff.
Leslie Knope,Discuss that.
April Ludgate,There's not much more to discuss.
April Ludgate,You kind of explained it all.
Leslie Knope,Who else is gay?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need your help."
Leslie Knope,There was a lull.
Leslie Knope,I saw Justin yawn.
Leslie Knope,Please tell me that yawning is a sign of excitement in India or something.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, focus!"
Leslie Knope,"God, you're no help."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to be clear, this will in no way influence me."
Leslie Knope,It won't affect my decision.
Leslie Knope,And it has no bearing on the future of your class.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, little buddy!"
Ron Swanson,Everything okay?
Ron Swanson,That took a long time.
Wendy,Poor Tommy.
Wendy,He has a very frail colon.
Justin,"I feel your pain, brother."
Justin,The hottest thing I ever put into my mouth was in this remote village in Southern Brazil.
Leslie Knope,This sounds good.
Justin,Yeah.
Justin,They take a little bit of scorpion poison and they serve--
Leslie Knope,I wonder who that is.
Leslie Knope,Who could that be?
Justin,More people?
Leslie Knope,A belly dancer?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"It's weird, but she just showed up."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not the kind of person that's gonna throw someone out, or, you know, not let them in if they randomly show up."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how they all got here.
Leslie Knope,"You know, people hear about a killer party at Knope's house, they all come running."
Leslie Knope,"You don't do origami every day, do ya?"
Andy Dwyer," They brought in a little entertainment, thank God."
Andy Dwyer," That Justin, he's so boring."
Ben, What are you talking about? He's incredible.
Derek, Yeah.
Derek," He's not gay, but if he were, I would totally break up with Ben for him."
Ben," Yeah, I would understand."
Ben," He's amazing, right, April?"
Andy Dwyer,"Right, April? Don't we love him?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate, He's actually kind of awesome.
Andy Dwyer, You're underage.
Andy Dwyer," I could lose my liquor license, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate, Andy.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Are you having fun?
Justin,"All I can say is, this is not what I was expecting."
Justin, I cannot believe there's more.
Leslie Knope, There's not.
Barney," Miss Knope, I understand that you're currently evaluating the rec center teachers."
Ron Swanson," You're doing what, Leslie?"
Barney,I demand an evaluation.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, What course do you teach?
Barney,"When it comes to choosing accounting software, there's no accounting for taste."
Barney, The advantage of QuickBooks Pro is that it's easy to assemble a list of vendors--
Ron Swanson,"Well, this is great."
Ron Swanson," I'm heading home, so as not to have to be here anymore."
Ron Swanson," My office, first thing tomorrow."
Ann Perkins," Yeah, I think we're probably gonna take off, too."
Barney, The demonstration takes another 45 minutes.
Leslie Knope," Yeah, guys, please."
Leslie Knope," Everybody, can you just stay? Okay? Justin, would you--"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Phil," I promise you, Miss Knope, this disciplinary committee will go over every detail of what happened last night."
Phil, And we will determine whether you are guilty of abusing your power.
Phil, Do you have anything to say before we begin?
Leslie Knope,Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out.
Tom Haverford, I would like to say that Leslie is incapable of using people for her own gain.
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Tom."
Tom Haverford," But I can't, because Leslie loves using people for her own gain."
Leslie Knope," If I may, Phil, I'd like to say something to Tom on the record."
Phil, This has all been on the record.
Leslie Knope, I'm very sorry that I invited Wendy to the party.
Phil, Is Wendy one of the teachers?
Tom Haverford,"No, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife."
Leslie Knope, And hopefully then-to-be future wife.
Leslie Knope," Look, I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope, I put a new romance in front of an old friendship.
Tom Haverford, Okay.
Leslie Knope, I put a beautiful man in front of an adorable man child.
Tom Haverford, You're ruining it.
Leslie Knope, I put a big white stallion in front of a little brown pony.
Tom Haverford, Totally uncalled for.
Phil, Ron Swanson will be next.
Ron Swanson," When it comes to government hearings, the only type of witness I enjoy being is a hostile one."
Ron Swanson, That's why I intend to answer every one of their questions with a question.
Phil, Were you aware that all of the entertainment and food was provided by rec center teachers?
Ron Swanson,Would I have stayed if I knew that?
Phil,"I don't know, would you have?"
Ron Swanson,Would you have?
Phil,No.
Phil, I wouldn't have.
Phil, Did you hear Leslie make any promises?
Ron Swanson,What constitutes a promise?
Phil,A quid pro quo.
Ron Swanson, Oh! Do you know Latin?
Phil,Okay.
Phil," Thank you, Ron."
Ron Swanson, Are we done?
April Ludgate,Can I get a shine?
Andy Dwyer, Oh. No.
Andy Dwyer, I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer," We're closed, due to betrayment."
April Ludgate," Well, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate, But I don't know what you're talking about.
Andy Dwyer," Why don't you ask your new best friend, whose name is Justin."
April Ludgate, Justin?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate, I would.
April Ludgate, But he's probably too busy cleaning gum out of his coat pockets.
Andy Dwyer, Wow.
Andy Dwyer, Unbetrayed.
Phil," So, you don't work for the government and you had no idea that these people were teachers from the local rec center?"
Justin,No.
Phil, I was simply attending a dinner party at my friend's house.
Phil," Why is he here, Miss Knope?"
Leslie Knope,That will become clear.
Leslie Knope,"Mr.  Anderson, could you please describe that evening?"
Justin,"Well, I had a very pleasant time."
Justin," And from my perspective, there was no abuse of power with respect to Miss Knope and any of her various guests."
Leslie Knope," Could you define pleasant? Did you have a good time? Did you have a great time? Be specific, and do remember that you're under oath."
Justin, I had an amazing time.
Leslie Knope, But you fell asleep.
Justin," Oh, God."
Justin, I'm so sorry.
Justin," You know, look, I'd been given a case the night before, so I had to stay up all night working on it and I didn't want to cancel."
Leslie Knope, You should've told me.
Leslie Knope, I would've rescheduled.
Justin, Are you kidding me? I was looking forward to it.
Justin, I had an awesome time which had nothing to do with the rec center teachers.
Leslie Knope, No further questions.
Phil, Okay.
Phil," We're going to take a break, and we'll let you know what we decide in about an hour."
Justin, Great.
Justin, I will see you later.
Leslie Knope," I'm in the middle of official business, so I can't talk about it right now."
Justin, Okay.
Leslie Knope," But, yes, yes, you will."
Leslie Knope," So, did you get that? He said amazing and awesome."
Leslie Knope," So, I'm gonna drive up and see him next weekend."
Leslie Knope, There's some Kabuki theater festival happening.
Ann Perkins, Great.
Ann Perkins, You're so relaxed.
Ann Perkins, You're not freaking out about this at all?
Phil,"Okay, Leslie."
Phil, We've reached our decision.
Phil, We're not going to take any further action at this time.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Phil, It really helped that you asked for this hearing yourself.
Phil, And that you made financial restitution out of your own pocket.
Phil, But I think we both know you skirted a line here.
Ann Perkins, You turned yourself in? Why?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I did something wrong, and I felt bad."
Leslie Knope," So, this morning I donated 1,000 dollars to the rec center, so everybody could keep teaching their classes."
Ann Perkins," Okay, so why did you ask for the hearing?"
Leslie Knope,"Are you kidding, Ann? It's every girl's dream to ask a dude how their date went under penalty of perjury."
Leslie Knope, I'm not proud of my actions.
Leslie Knope," But the most important thing is, there is now an official government document that proves my dinner party kicked ass."
Justin, Tommy Hav.
Tom Haverford, J Train!
Tom Haverford,"What's up, brother?"
Justin,"This might be none of my business, but you need to ask Wendy out."
Justin," For reals, this time."
Tom Haverford, Did Leslie tell you--
Justin,No.
Justin, She didn't need to.
Justin, I saw it.
Tom Haverford," I'm not gay, but you're the most incredible man I've ever met."
Justin, That doesn't sound gay at all.
Justin, See you around.
Tom Haverford, Take care.
Justin," Bye, brother."
Tom Haverford, You sure you don't want to come hang out for a minute?

Tom Haverford,Who am I supposed to ask for fashion advice?
Tom Haverford,Jerry?
Tom Haverford,He wears the same soup-stained khakis every day.
Tom Haverford,Justin's my savior.

Justin,It's horrible.
Donna Meagle,I like it.
Randall,Sweetums has been Pawnee's leading sweet treat manufacturer for over 80 years.
Randall,And we are so excited about our new partnership with the Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"Starting next month, Sweetums is gonna take over the concession stands in our parks."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't love the idea of corporate sponsorship, but Sweetums is an institution."
Leslie Knope,"When you think of Pawnee, you think of Sweetums."
Randall,"Although candy is our bread and butter, we also care about the health of our customers."
Randall,"And that's why we'll be debuting our new healthy energy bar, NutriYums."
Randall,Take a look.

Ron Swanson,I could not be happier about this.

Ron Swanson,Chuck E. Cheese could run the parks.
Ron Swanson,Everything operated by tokens.
Ron Swanson,"Drop in a token, go on the swing set."
Ron Swanson,"Drop in another token, take a walk."
Ron Swanson,"Drop in a token, look at a duck."
Tom Haverford,Brendanawicz!
Tom Haverford,"Quick question, do you personally know Xzibit?"
Tom Haverford,"Because I was checking out that pickup truck of yours, and that ride is pimped!"
Mark Brendanawicz,It's really nice of you to compliment my pickup truck with no ulterior motives.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, so, listen, I need to move some stuff this weekend into my new bachelor pad, since my divorce is finally going down."
Tom Haverford,Just some odds and ends.
Tom Haverford,"You can bring up the Markmobile, help me move, right?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm totally blanking on a valid excuse right now, so, yes."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'll help you.
Tom Haverford,My boy!
Mark Brendanawicz,I [bleep] hate having a pickup truck.
Tom Haverford,"Andy, I have a very interesting business proposal for you."
Tom Haverford,I'm moving a lot of heavy stuff out of my place this weekend.
Andy Dwyer,Can I help you move?
Andy Dwyer,I'm really good at it.
Andy Dwyer,"Afterwards, I'll take the cardboard from the boxes and use it for break dancing."
April Ludgate,"I'll go, too."

Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll let the chart be the judge of that."
Leslie Knope,"What are you, 5'11"", 210 pounds, three whiskeys?"
Leslie Knope,Looks like you are just over the line into impaired.
Ron Swanson,You carry that with you all the time?
Leslie Knope,It comes in handy.
Leslie Knope,"And on the back, it teaches you how to play blackjack."
Ron Swanson,Swansons have a preternaturally high tolerance for alcohol.
Ron Swanson,My old man used to put Wild Turkey on his Corn Flakes.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not gonna argue with you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"We're just gonna sit and wait until, you know, you're safe to drive, which would be in about one hour."

Leslie Knope,I watched a really good--
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Ron Swanson,This is what I did last night.
Ron Swanson,"After I got home, I drank six more glasses of whiskey and then I finished crafting this small harp, using a band saw, a spokeshave and an oscillating spindle sander."
Leslie Knope,Beautiful.
Ron Swanson,"But wait, there's more."
Ron Swanson,Here are some photographs of me drinking the whiskey.
Ron Swanson,"You'll notice I'm holding up yesterday's newspaper, so you can tell that I'm not lying."
Leslie Knope,I feel like I'm in a spa.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I got my truck all cleaned out and ready to go for tomorrow."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Do you have, like, furniture pads and dollies?"
Mark Brendanawicz,That sort of thing?
Tom Haverford,"Ooh, I thought the mover supplied those."
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not a mover!
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm a sap who owns a truck.
Tom Haverford,Don't talk about yourself like that.
Tom Haverford,And bring some coffee.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you moving out?"
Leslie Knope,Have you told Wendy how you feel yet?
Tom Haverford,Waiting for the right time.
Leslie Knope,It's right now.
Leslie Knope,The time is now.
Tom Haverford,Just don't worry about it.

Jerry Gergich,They are terrific.
April Ludgate,"Terrific's not more than amazing, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,No?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, it's not less."
Donna Meagle,Everything Sweetums makes is off the charts.
Donna Meagle,I like their candy fingernails.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe these things are healthy.
Andy Dwyer,It's not that crazy.
Andy Dwyer,"Krackel bars, also healthy and delicious."
Donna Meagle,"No, they're not."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,They actually have rice in them.
Andy Dwyer,So…
Donna Meagle,"Andy, you're fine, but you're simple."
Ann Perkins,Who just put 100 of these in their body?
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Look at you!
Leslie Knope,You're looking pretty unhealthy today.
Leslie Knope,"You might need one of these, NutriYum, by Sweetums."
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat them, Sweetums!"
Tom Haverford,I love that song.
Ann Perkins,Ow!
Tom Haverford,I need to go check my email.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sell these in the park now.
Jerry Gergich,They're healthy!
Ann Perkins,Holy God.
Ann Perkins,"No, they're not, they're terrible for you."
Leslie Knope,"No, they're not."
Leslie Knope,There's a picture of Lance Armstrong on there.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but look at the ingredients."
Ann Perkins,"""High fructose corn syrup, corn syrup."""
Leslie Knope,There's only eight grams of fat.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Per serving.
Ann Perkins,A bar is four servings.
Leslie Knope,"Well, people seem to enjoy them."
Leslie Knope,Look how happy everybody is.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's a sugar rush."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That makes sense.
Ann Perkins,"They're gonna crash soon, and it's not gonna be pretty."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm gonna crash soon, too."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause I've eaten, like, 40 of these."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God!"
Ann Perkins,"Generally, I like to stay out of other people's business."
Ann Perkins,But Pawnee is the fourth most obese city in America.
Ann Perkins,The kids here are beefy.
Ann Perkins,"They're just husky, big boned, plus-sized chunk monsters."

Ann Perkins,"Let's get some almonds in you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Get it.
Leslie Knope,I can't open them.
Leslie Knope,Back to work.

Leslie Knope,This place is evil.
Ann Perkins,"I think these are the only two films that say ""Sweetums"" on the label."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, let's take them both."
Leslie Knope,We might find something interesting.
Leslie Knope,"Here, just let me stick them under my shirt."
Ann Perkins,No.
Leslie Knope,Just walk out.
Ann Perkins,They have sensors!
Ann Perkins,Just check them out.
Ann Perkins,It's free.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Marci."
Marci,Leslie.
Marci,Are they finally teaching you Parks people how to read?
Marci,"Oh, I guess not."
Marci,It's a movie.
Leslie Knope,You're pretty cocky for someone whose job is obsolete because of the Internet.
Marci,Let's see.
Marci,Hmm.
Marci,You seem to have a 40 dollars late fee on a book called Mysteries of the Female Orgasm.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Marci,"Yeah, you do."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, grab the movie!"
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go, go!"
Leslie Knope,Punkass book jockeys!
Paul,"So, you guys all good with the Sweetums concession stand deal?"
Paul,I can go ahead and sign off on it?
Ron Swanson,You betcha.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, no."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We are worried that the energy bars that they're gonna sell are grossly unhealthy and they're misleading people about what's actually in them.
Ron Swanson,"No, we're not worried about that."
Ron Swanson,We're fine and we sign off.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can I have a sidebar with Ron?"
Paul,I guess.
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I did some research, and NutriYums are terrible for you."
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Ron Swanson,We're doing it.
Leslie Knope,That's a-- We're in a sidebar.
Leslie Knope,Do you not care about your city's health?
Ron Swanson,I care about the people's right to consume whatever they want.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, can you and I have a sidebar?"
Paul,No.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think maybe we should hold a public forum.
Leslie Knope,That way we won't be liable.
Ron Swanson,There's no point.
Ron Swanson,It's a home run for the city.
Paul,"No, I think she's right."
Paul,"It's a good ""cover our ass"" move."
Paul,Let's do it.
Ron Swanson,Paul!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, why must you stick your nose into everyone else's business?"
Leslie Knope,"Sidebar, Paul."
Leslie Knope,Ron's upset because I didn't let him drive last night.
Ron Swanson,Stop sidebarring.
Leslie Knope,Somebody's grouchy.
Mark Brendanawicz,You said it was just odds and ends.
Tom Haverford,"It is, yeah."
Tom Haverford,And some furniture.
Tom Haverford,And the plasma TV.
Mark Brendanawicz,You haven't even folded up the boxes yet.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, Deep Blue Sea."
Andy Dwyer,Greatest movie ever made.
Tom Haverford,"That's the Canadian version, and there's a bonus audio track where LL Cool J raps all his dialog."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,We're watching this right now.
April Ludgate,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Pop it in!
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, no, no!"
Mark Brendanawicz,We should really pack this room up and get moving.
Tom Haverford,"So, this is a really big room I need packed up, guys."
Mark Brendanawicz,This is your bedroom?
Tom Haverford,"No, it's a spare room I converted into a walk-in closet/ home fitness center."
Mark Brendanawicz,What is that?
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,I strapped an MP3 player to one of those floor cleaning robots.
Tom Haverford,"I call him ""DJ Roomba."""
Tom Haverford,Little guy cruises around and plays music.
Tom Haverford,"What's hot, DJ Roomba?"
Tom Haverford,"DJ Roomba, tearing it up!"
Andy Dwyer,He likes me.
Tom Haverford,"Let's dance for a little while, Mark."
Ann Perkins,What NutriYums energy bars are just absolutely loaded with high fructose corn syrup and fatty oils.
Ann Perkins,"And any way you slice it, they're just extremely unhealthy for you."
Ron Swanson,Leslie needs to butt out.
Ron Swanson,"The whole point of this country is, if you want to eat garbage, balloon up to 600 pounds and die of a heart attack at 43, you can."
Ron Swanson,You are free to do so.
Ron Swanson,"To me, that's beautiful."
Ann Perkins,Any questions?
Extra,"If sugar is so bad, how come Jesus made it taste so good?"
Ann Perkins,Yes?
Gretel,But isn't all food bad for you?
Gretel,I've been eating lasagna and muffins every day of my life for 40 years and I feel terrible.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Chance Frenlm,What's so bad about corn syrup?
Chance Frenlm,It's natural.
Chance Frenlm,Corn's a fruit.
Chance Frenlm,Syrup comes from a bush.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Extra,How do we know you're really a nurse?
Ann Perkins,"I am, I promise."
Ann Perkins,I work at Saint Joe's.
Extra,"Well, the point is, my friend thinks you're cute."
Extra,Give me your number so he can have it.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's not gonna happen."
Extra,Can I have your e mail address?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Extra,I just got on AOL.
Ann Perkins,No!
Chance Frenlm,I think we ought to throw those bars out and eat ham and mayonnaise sandwiches.
Ann Perkins,That's not a good idea.
Chance Frenlm,Ham and mayonnaise!
Ann Perkins,That's not-- No.
Chance Frenlm,Ham and mayonnaise!
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no."
All,Ham and mayonnaise!
All,Ham and mayonnaise!
All,Ham and mayonnaise!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you do this every week.
Leslie Knope,I'm actually encouraged.
Leslie Knope,The questions were more relevant than usual.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I need to order the brown Timberlands in a size eight, narrow."
Tom Haverford,How much is the next day shipping?
Tom Haverford,"And, what's two day shipping?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'd like to place an order for one pad thai, chicken, and no scallions on it, please."
Tom Haverford,"Just for one person, yeah."
Tom Haverford,Just one.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I saw Mark carrying, like, three boxes."
Tom Haverford,That dude is strong.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,I'll carry five boxes!
Tom Haverford,"Go get 'em, champ!"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, Donna."
Mark Brendanawicz,Where do you want this?
Donna Meagle,Uh-uh.
Donna Meagle,That's it.
Donna Meagle,My baby has a delicate suspension.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you kidding me?
Donna Meagle,"No, I'm not."
Donna Meagle,Move.
Tom Haverford,"Put it in your truck, Brendanawicz."
Tom Haverford,There's plenty of room.

Randall,I guess that about says it all.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it doesn't, actually."
Leslie Knope,"I think we should watch another video right now, one that your company made 30 years ago."
Nick Newport,"I'm Nick Newport, president of Sweetums, giving you a look inside our corn syrup factory."
Nick Newport,"This is all new, high fructose corn syrup, a miracle product that's sweeter than sugar, but cheaper to produce!"
Nick Newport,"Cheap, delicious, sugary corn is currently being used by farms to fatten up their cows and pigs."
Nick Newport,Look how fat those cows are!
Nick Newport,"Fat, happy and docile, the way we like them."
Leslie Knope,"So, you still want to claim that corn syrup is healthy?"
Randall,"Corn syrup is natural, and it's fine in moderation."
Randall,But don't take my word for it.
Randall,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Nick Newport, Jr.!"
Nick Newport Jr.,All right!
Nick Newport Jr.,What's going on?
Nick Newport Jr.,Yeah!

Andy Dwyer,I just wanna get-- That's good hose water.
Andy Dwyer,Don't get my shoes.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's up, guys?"
Andy Dwyer,"You come to help Tom move, too?"
Andy Dwyer,Too late!
Andy Dwyer,We already almost got all of it.
Derek,"No, we just thought it'd be funny to see April doing physical labor."
Andy Dwyer,It's been an awesome moving day.
Andy Dwyer,I got the little robot to play Dave Matthews.
Andy Dwyer,Little baby!
Ben,What's he talking about?
April Ludgate,DJ Roomba.
Ben,What?
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Back to the grindstone.
Andy Dwyer,"Awesome seeing you, dudes."

April Ludgate, Hi.
Wendy," God, this is so weird."
Wendy," It's, like, end of an era, huh? It's kind of sad."
Tom Haverford," Yeah, we'll still be friends."
Wendy, Yeah.
Wendy," Well, hey, you guys must be starving."
Wendy, You want me to order you pizza or something?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, that'd be great, yeah."
Wendy, Okay.
Tom Haverford," Why don't you get some Canadian bacon on it, since you're from Canada."
Wendy, Mmm-hmm.
Tom Haverford," And sausage, 'cause I am brown and spicy."
Wendy," Okay, all right."
Wendy," Well, I will see you around, I guess."
Tom Haverford, Yeah.
Wendy, Right?
Tom Haverford,I'm around.
Wendy, I'll see you around.
Tom Haverford, Bye.
Wendy, Bye.
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope," Mr. Newport, Jr., thank you so much for coming."
Leslie Knope," But don't you think that every person has a right to know what they're putting in their bodies? Right, everybody?"
Extra,Is Shoelace here? Where's Shoelace?
Nick Newport Jr.,Shoelace couldn't make it.
All, Aw!
Nick Newport Jr.,But I do agree with this nice lady.
Nick Newport Jr., That's why I say we should let the people be the judge.
Nick Newport Jr., Denver?
Denver,Everybody! Check under your seats!
Extra,"Look, look! I got chocolate!"
Leslie Knope,"Denver, you little son of a bitch."
Jerry Gergich, Mmm.
Jerry Gergich, There's no pizza left?
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Jer."
Tom Haverford, Too slow.
Andy Dwyer," Do you want my crusts? Here, take this."
Jerry Gergich, Nobody even told me the pizza was here.
Tom Haverford, Jerry! You stepped on DJ Roomba!
Jerry Gergich,That was an accident.
Tom Haverford, You killed him! I built him myself.
Tom Haverford, He was like a son to me.
Ron Swanson, Okay.
Ron Swanson, Time to vote.
Ron Swanson," All those who would like the bloated corpse of the government to keep running the snack bars at taxpayer expense, raise your hands."
Leslie Knope, That seems like an unfair phrasing.
Leslie Knope," And all those in favor of letting this heartless corporation, Sweetums, stuff your children with sugary crap, raise your hand."
Ron Swanson," Thank you, everybody."
Ann Perkins, I can't believe this.
Leslie Knope, You know what? We did our job.
Leslie Knope, We informed the public.
Leslie Knope, That's all we can do.
Landlord," I'm sorry, man."
Landlord, There's nothing we can do.
Tom Haverford, Are you serious?
Landlord,"Look, we'll get it fixed and I'll see you Monday."
Tom Haverford, I just got off the phone with my new landlord.
Tom Haverford," Apparently, there's been some sort of gas leak and I can't move into my place until Monday now."
Mark Brendanawicz, Are you telling us we have to unload this and move it back in the house?
Tom Haverford,"No, I can't put it there."
Tom Haverford, I promised Wendy I'd be out of here tonight.
Tom Haverford, I got it.
Tom Haverford," Everybody go home, pack away my stuff in your own houses."
Tom Haverford," Then on Monday, pack it back up, meet me at my new place, unload it there."
Tom Haverford," Come on, guys."
Mark Brendanawicz," See you, Tom."
Donna Meagle, Bye.
Jerry Gergich, Later.
Derek," Hey, bro, wanna go get our grub on?"
Ben,"Totes, bro."
Ben, Wings and brews!
April Ludgate,Why are you guys talking like that?
Derek,"Just chillaxin' like your new bro, Andy."
Ben, Yeah.
Ben," Wanna play some Hacky Sack later, maybe listen to Blues Traveler?"
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate, I'm leaving.
Derek, We're just kidding.
Derek, Let's go to dinner.
April Ludgate, I'm not hungry.
April Ludgate, And you guys aren't being funny.
Derek, Why are you being weird? We make fun of people like that.
Derek, That's what we do.
April Ludgate," You know, for a gay couple, you guys are being really gay."
Nick Newport Jr.," I said, ""Of course I remember you. You're Chastity, right?"""
Ron Swanson,"Leslie! Even though I didn't invite you, you came here anyway."
Ron Swanson," I respect that, because you made a choice as a free American."
Ann Perkins, What are you eating?
Ron Swanson,"I call this ""turf and turf."""
Ron Swanson,It's a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse.
Ron Swanson," Also, whiskey and a cigar."
Ron Swanson, I'm gonna consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.
Waiter," No cigars inside, sir."
Ron Swanson, Fine.
Ron Swanson, I will smoke the entire thing outside.
Ron Swanson," Even though it is bad for me, I am going to do it."
Ann Perkins, Why is he being such an ass?
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Ron Swanson," It's freezing outside, so I will not be smoking this cigar."
Ron Swanson," But rest assured, I could if I wanted to, because this--"
Leslie Knope,"This is America, right? Is it?"
Leslie Knope,"May I speak with you, please? Look, I don't know if you're being a jerk on purpose just to prove you have the right to be a jerk, but either way, you're being a jerk."
Leslie Knope," So, here."
Leslie Knope, Take the booze chart.
Ron Swanson, Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope," If you're gonna drink, you should use it, okay? I'm gonna head out."
Leslie Knope," By the way, maybe it's none of my business, but if you eat three pounds of steak every day, you're gonna die, and although I've already written your eulogy, and it's incredibly touching, I would prefer not to give it for a while."
Leslie Knope," The first line, by the way? ""O Captain! My Captain! Ron Swanson, a swan song."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and it gets better from there."
Andy Dwyer, April! April! You wanna watch me rollerblade in the parking lot after work? I'm pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer, I used to be really good.
Andy Dwyer," That was, like, 70 pounds ago."
April Ludgate, I can't.
April Ludgate, I'm kind of busy.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, that's lame."
Andy Dwyer, Tomorrow?
April Ludgate,Maybe.
April Ludgate, I don't know.
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Andy Dwyer, Bye.
Andy Dwyer, Just kidding! I don't fall!
Ron Swanson,What are you eating?
Leslie Knope,I didn't have time to have breakfast.
Ron Swanson, I'm gonna toss these in the dumpster outside.
Ron Swanson, And I don't wanna see you digging around in there later.
Ron Swanson, I am sorry.
Ron Swanson, I have been a horse's ass.
Ron Swanson, And that is the end of what I have to say.
Leslie Knope, Apology accepted.
Leslie Knope, Put a coat on.
Leslie Knope, It's freezing outside.
Tom Haverford, Jerry! Jerry! This is the ghost of DJ Roomba.
Tom Haverford," Why did you kill me? I'm gonna haunt you, Jerry."
Tom Haverford, I'm gonna follow you and play the Black Eyed Peas on a non-stop loop!

Leslie Knope,"If you look inside your bags, you will find a few things."
Leslie Knope,A bouquet of handcrocheted flower pens…
All,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"A mosaic portrait of each of you made from the crushed bottles of your favorite diet soda, and a personalized 5000 word essay of why you are all so awesome."
Leslie Knope,What's Galentine's Day?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's only the best day of the year."
Leslie Knope,"Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home and we just come and kick it breakfast style."
Leslie Knope,Ladies celebrating ladies.
Leslie Knope,It's like Lilith Fair minus the angst.
Leslie Knope,Plus frittatas.
Leslie Knope,"So to conclude our Galentine's Day breakfast, it is time for the greatest story ever told."
Ann Perkins,What's the story?
Ann Perkins,It's the most romantic story ever.
Ann Perkins,It makes The Notebook look like Saw V.
Leslie Knope,"Go, Mom, go."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It was 1968.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I was 18 and our family went on a vacation to Bermuda.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And on the first day, I went for a swim in the ocean."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And I got caught in a very strong current.
Ann Perkins,"You've heard this story before, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the drama."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The next thing I felt were two very powerful arms whisking me to safety.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And he looked down at me and he said, ""Are you okay?"""
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"And I looked up at him and I said, ""I am now."""
Leslie Knope,So they sneak out to meet each other and walk on the beach.
Leslie Knope,"And two weeks later, he asked her to marry him and move to Illinois."
Leslie Knope,"But her parents thought she was too young, so she said no."
Leslie Knope,"And then they lost touch, and a few years later she met my dad."
Tom Haverford,I gotta take one of those lifeguard courses.
Tom Haverford,Those guys get all the action.
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Justin,We gotta find this guy.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,He's probably married or dead.
Tom Haverford,What's the difference?
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Justin,"Well, at least let me try and find him."
Justin,Imagine how much better that story would be if we actually reunited them?
Tom Haverford,I think Justin's right.
Tom Haverford,You should let him do this.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,"But if you find him and he's weird, like a ventriloquist, or a puppeteer, or anyone who pretends toys are people, then abort the mission."
Justin,Absolutely.
Tom Haverford,Absolutely.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You, you're the best girlfriend ever."
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Ann Perkins,Happy Valentine's Day.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I knew, eventually, somehow, being in a relationship with you would totally pay off."
Ann Perkins,I bought him some actual towels.
Ann Perkins,He was using a bathrobe.
Ann Perkins,"And I bought him some other things that humans usually use, like shampoo."
Leslie Knope,"Troops, gather around."
Leslie Knope,Great news.
Leslie Knope,"The Senior Center Valentine's Dance is tomorrow, from 5:00 to 9:00."
Tom Haverford,Are we talking a.m. or p.m.?
Tom Haverford,Those people are old.
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,Justin's not here.
Leslie Knope,"It isn't just a job, gang, we're gonna learn a lot from these seniors."
Leslie Knope,Some of them have been married for half a century.
Leslie Knope,"And no offense, but everybody here is terrible at love."
Leslie Knope,"Divorced, dating a gay guy, divorced twice, jury's still out on you two."
Leslie Knope,"And Jerry, who knows."
Jerry Gergich,I've been happily married for 28 years.
Jerry Gergich,"You've met my wife, Gayle, many times."
Leslie Knope,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,"Finally, Ann and Mark are our special volunteers, and they will be available whenever needed."
Mark Brendanawicz,I didn't volunteer.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, too bad."
Leslie Knope,You got drafted.
Leslie Knope,"Ask not what your old people could do for you, ask what you could do for your old people."
Tom Haverford,Terminator.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, JFK."
Leslie Knope,This meeting has been terminated.
Leslie Knope,That is the Terminator.
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Leslie Knope,Where am I going?
Leslie Knope,"Well, hello there."
Wendy,"Well, hey."
Wendy,I got your message.
Wendy,You wanted to talk?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I do."
Wendy,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Have a seat.
Wendy,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,Some champagne?
Wendy,"Uh, no, thanks."
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,This is Armand de Brignac.
Tom Haverford,Jay-Z drinks this.
Wendy,"Yeah, well, Jay-Z doesn't have to perform surgery in an hour."
Tom Haverford,You don't know Jay-Z's schedule.
Tom Haverford,He's a renaissance man.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, fine."
Tom Haverford,"Well, this is for you."
Wendy,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"Well, it's almost Valentine's Day, so I thought it would be a good day to tell you that--"
Wendy,Okay.
Wendy,Let me just stop you right there.
Wendy,"Look, Tommy, I just want you to know I'm so grateful for everything you did for me, but I only see us as friends."
Tom Haverford,For now.
Tom Haverford,But think about how much better our friendship would be if we added doing it.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, I know our marriage was fake, but there's something between us."
Tom Haverford,"And I think we should give it a shot, for real."
Wendy,I just don't feel that way about you.
Wendy,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"Each time I do, Just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin, I've got you, Under my skin."
Andy Dwyer,"So, there's that one, I guess."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,You guys sound ready for the dance tomorrow.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know about these old fogy songs, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Why can't we just do our originals?
Andy Dwyer,"I just wrote a new song, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Bottom line, it's called Sex Hair."
Andy Dwyer,It's about how you can tell when someone's just had sex 'cause of how their hair gets matted up in the back.
Andy Dwyer,It's awesome.
Leslie Knope,Think of it this way.
Leslie Knope,"These songs are exactly like the songs you usually play, except instead of modern rock, they're old jazzy standards from the '40s."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,You got a point.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do great.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, guys."
Kyle,"Andy, I've been here for half an hour."
Kyle,Can I get my shoes shined?
Andy Dwyer,"Kyle, I'm gonna lose my [bleep] on you if you ask me one more time."
Justin,Found him.
Justin,"Frank Beckerson, 63."
Justin,"Lives in a little town called Bridgeport, Illinois."
Justin,"Divorced, no kids, worked as a lifeguard when he was 20."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I need a half a day off for a secret mission of love."
Ron Swanson,You're asking my permission to take a nooner?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,Justin and I need to go on a romantically inspired road trip.
Ron Swanson,So it is a nooner?
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're planning to leave around noon, so I'm not quite sure--"
Justin,"That's-- No, Leslie, that is not a nooner."
Justin,I tracked down this old flame of Leslie's mom.
Justin,We're gonna go pick him up.
Justin,We're gonna reunite them on Valentine's Day.
Justin,Is that a great story or what?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, great story indeed."
Ron Swanson,Enjoy your half day off.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Justin,Pick you up tomorrow around noon.
Leslie Knope,For our nooner.
Leslie Knope,Which is a cute word.
Ron Swanson,Explain it to her later.
Leslie Knope,Explain what?
Mark Brendanawicz,Happy Valentine's Day.
Mark Brendanawicz,"First off, a bear in a paper bag and a heartshaped balloon."
Ann Perkins,I love bears in bags.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, you will like this, then."
Mark Brendanawicz,Because this is a giant teddy bear holding a red heart.
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Mark Brendanawicz,Festive.
Mark Brendanawicz,What's this?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, I don't know."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's a dozen red roses in a heart-shaped arrangement.
Mark Brendanawicz,See that?
Mark Brendanawicz,Perfume.
Mark Brendanawicz,For the lady.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,"""Yearning, by Dennis Feinstein."""
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,Dennis.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, Dennis."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Finally, The Heart of the Ocean."
Ann Perkins,Gorgeous.
Mark Brendanawicz,I never had a chance to get a girl a cliched Valentine's Day gift before.
Mark Brendanawicz,So I got you all of them.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,That was very sweet.
Leslie Knope,Do you think they'll get married?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, what if they get married?"
Justin,That would be amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Would I call him ""Dad"" then?"
Justin,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"No, that'd be too much."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe I'll call him ""Pappy."""
Leslie Knope,Pop?
Leslie Knope,Poppy?
Leslie Knope,PawPaw?
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,I'm getting ahead of myself.
Justin,Hey.
Justin,You never know.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna call him ""PooPaw."""
Leslie Knope,How often do you get to reunite soul mates?
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that you could reunite Romeo and Juliet?
Leslie Knope,Or Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jen."
Leslie Knope,I really want you to be happy.
Leslie Knope,Stay away from John Mayer.
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Frank Beckerson.
Leslie Knope,I feel like I've known him my whole life.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Frank Beckerson,My God.
Frank Beckerson,Marlene.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,PooPaw.
Leslie Knope,"PooPaw, no."
Leslie Knope,I'm not Marlene.
Frank Beckerson,Oh!
Frank Beckerson,So sorry.
Frank Beckerson,I should really wear my glasses.
Frank Beckerson,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Frank, I was wondering."
Leslie Knope,My mom always said that you wanted to be a lawyer.
Leslie Knope,Did that work out?
Frank Beckerson,No.
Frank Beckerson,Never did.
Frank Beckerson,Though I did once act as my own lawyer.
Frank Beckerson,Oh!
Frank Beckerson,I found some old pictures of Marlene and me.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Look how young she is.
Justin,These are amazing.
Frank Beckerson,Probably shouldn't show you this one.
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Frank Beckerson,Your mom was such a firecracker.
Frank Beckerson,"Smart, funny, sharp as a tack."
Frank Beckerson,Such firm breasts.
Frank Beckerson,"Oh, that was inappropriate."
Frank Beckerson,Wow.
Frank Beckerson,"I am just, all of a sudden, so nervous to see her again."
Frank Beckerson,I'm gonna throw up real quick and then we can leave.
Derek,Hi.
April Ludgate,Hi.
Derek,Valentine's bash at The Bulge tonight.
Derek,We can get you a drink bracelet.
April Ludgate,I can't.
April Ludgate,I've gotta work at the Senior Center Valentine's Day Dance thing.
Ben,That sounds amazing.
Ben,Can we come?
April Ludgate,I guess.
April Ludgate,I don't know why you would want to.
Derek,Because old people are funny.
Ben,"Yeah, it'll be like The Golden Girls."
Derek,I have to go get ready.
Leslie Knope,"So, Frank, where have you been for the past 40 years?"
Frank Beckerson,Oh!
Frank Beckerson,"You know, here and there."
Frank Beckerson,You know?
Frank Beckerson,"Grenada, for a while."
Frank Beckerson,"Then Panama, then Afghanistan."
Leslie Knope,So you were in the military?
Frank Beckerson,Nope.
Frank Beckerson,"You know, I always wonder how different my life would've been if your mother had married me."
Frank Beckerson,It would've been better.
Frank Beckerson,I'll tell you that much.
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Frank Beckerson,I'm fine.
Frank Beckerson,I'm good.
Frank Beckerson,I am just so nervous to see her.
Frank Beckerson,There is nothing to be nervous about.
Frank Beckerson,Have you got a bag or something?
Leslie Knope,A what?
Justin,Do you have a bag?
Leslie Knope,I have a purse.
Justin,"Well, give him the purse then."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"You like potato and I like potahto, You like tomato and I like tomahto, Potato, potahto, Tomato, tomahto."
Andy Dwyer,Let's call the whole thing off.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh I mean, that sucked, didn't it?"
Burly,Maybe if you sang it like Louis Armstrong.
Andy Dwyer,"Maybe, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, here's the thing, though."
Andy Dwyer,Who is that?
Andy Dwyer,My problem is I don't know how to tell if we're doing good.
Andy Dwyer,"Because when you play a rock show, it's really easy to know if you're doing great because chicks will flash their boobs at you when you're up onstage."
Andy Dwyer,"And you're like, ""Oh!"""
Andy Dwyer,"""That must've sounded pretty good."""
Andy Dwyer,"If that happens here, my eyes will fall out of my head and I'll die."
Leslie Knope,Frank?
Leslie Knope,"Frank, are you okay?"
Justin,Maybe we should--
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Justin,Frank.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Justin,Frank.
Leslie Knope,Frank.
Andy Dwyer,"But I can't see anybody but you, Flip flop."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, I might be crazy, but I have this weird suspicion that things are going well with us."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I have that same suspicion."
Mark Brendanawicz,"But you know, having never been in something like this before, I feel the need to ask, how am I doing?"
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, I'm sort of serious."
Mark Brendanawicz,"All right, fine, forget it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm just saying, you know, it seems to me, on paper, that this thing we have is pretty great."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, nerd."
Ann Perkins,"On paper, this thing we have is pretty great."
Ann Perkins,Mark is a great boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,I have no complaints at all.
Ann Perkins,Everything is good.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't feel right about this.
Justin,Are you kidding me?
Justin,This is so much fun.
Justin,"Look, we took a road trip today."
Justin,We chased your mom's long lost love down a freeway.
Leslie Knope,"He's a loon, Justin."
Justin,So he freaked out a little bit.
Justin,He got nervous.
Justin,"I mean, you would, too."
Justin,He was fine by the time we got him back inside the car.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't know why you're pushing."
Leslie Knope,Why do you want him to spend time with my mom?
Leslie Knope,How would that help her?
Leslie Knope,I don't like this.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is gonna work.
Leslie Knope,I'm calling this off.
Justin,Come on.
Justin,"No, no, no."
Justin,"Look, we're here."
Justin,Let's just see what happens.
Leslie Knope,"What happens is, I drive him home."
Justin,"Now, look."
Justin,You need to breathe.
Leslie Knope,I'm breathing.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Mom.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,There you are.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"So, what's the big surprise?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You gonna try to check me into an old folks home?
Leslie Knope,It's a long story.
Leslie Knope,"One that we'd love to tell you over a cup of coffee, somewhere far from this place."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Frank.
Frank Beckerson,"Hello, Marlene."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,My gosh.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I can't believe it's really you.
Frank Beckerson,Wanna catch up?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Justin,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Do you think we should stand by--
Justin,She's fine.
Justin,Let's just let this unfold.
Derek,"Come here, sonny."
Derek,Let me tell you about the Civil War.
Ben,"Grandpa, leave me alone."
Ben,You smell like death.
April Ludgate,I'm gonna get some punch.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,You guys are really adorable.
April Ludgate,It's really nice.
Justin,"So Leslie's like, ""That's it, I'm taking him home."""
Justin,"So, we look over, and he's not even in the car anymore."
Jerry Gergich,You're kidding.
Justin,No.
Justin,It's insane.
Ron Swanson,What does Leslie think about all this?
Justin,"Oh, God, Leslie."
Justin,I don't even know.
Justin,I think I just lost track of her in all the chaos.
Justin,"Anyway, so, now he and Marlene are off somewhere, doing God knows what."
Justin,I don't wanna--
Wendy,You're suing me for alimony?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"When we were married, I got accustomed to a certain lifestyle."
Tom Haverford,And I'm entitled to money to maintain that lifestyle.
Wendy,This is insane.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, it's insane, but it's all I got."
Tom Haverford,And you can make it all go away if you just gave me a chance.
Wendy,What?
Tom Haverford,Three dates.
Tom Haverford,One date.
Tom Haverford,Coffee?
Wendy,"So your plan was to sue me, and then to use that to blackmail me into falling in love with you."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,You guys sound good.
Andy Dwyer,You really think so?
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible to tell.
Andy Dwyer,It's like Bizarro Land out there.
Andy Dwyer,"As soon as we finish a song, it's dead silence."
Ann Perkins,"Well, what do you expect, you know."
Ann Perkins,They're like a million years old.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm glad you like it."
Andy Dwyer,You were always a big supporter of the band.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Break's over.
Andy Dwyer,"Ludgate, cracking the whip."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, these old bags paid for some entertainment."
April Ludgate,So get up there.
Andy Dwyer,"No, you're right."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Hey, you should play that song The Way You Look Tonight."
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.
April Ludgate,It's a good one.
Andy Dwyer,The next one's going out to a special little lady named April Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer,"Someday, when I'm all alone…"
Ann Perkins,Are you guys…
Ann Perkins,Never mind.
April Ludgate, Why do you care?
Ann Perkins, I don't.
Andy Dwyer," Just thinking of you, And the way you look tonight"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,What about you? What do you do for a living?
Frank Beckerson,"Well, it's been an interesting ride."
Marlene Griggs-Knope, Yeah?
Frank Beckerson,I got a job at a grocery store right out of college just for a way to make money.
Frank Beckerson," And here I am, 40 years later, completely unemployed."
Marlene Griggs-Knope, Wow.
Frank Beckerson, What do you say we pick up where we left off?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"You're not serious, right?"
Frank Beckerson,I'm serious as a heart attack.
Frank Beckerson, Of which I've had four.
Andy Dwyer," And the world is cold, I will feel a glow, Just thinking of you, And the way you look tonight"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mom, are you okay? Did Frank leave?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Uh, yeah."
Marlene Griggs-Knope, He just stepped away for a second.
Leslie Knope, I'm so sorry we brought him here.
Marlene Griggs-Knope," Oh, it's okay."
Marlene Griggs-Knope," It was very thoughtful, sweetheart."
Marlene Griggs-Knope, It's not your fault that he turned out to be--
Frank Beckerson,Excuse me.
Frank Beckerson, Hi.
Frank Beckerson," Excuse me, hi."
Frank Beckerson, My name is Frank Beckerson.
Frank Beckerson," Marlene, you blew it."
Frank Beckerson," Take one last look, Marlene, because you'll never see this body again."
Justin," Marlene, what happened between you two? Tell me everything."
Justin, I want every detail.
April Ludgate," Hey, we're almost done, so we can leave soon."
Derek, Yes.
Derek," I'll take you for an ice cream malted, and then we can go choose our caskets."
April Ludgate," God, why does everything we do have to be cloaked in, like, 15 layers of irony?"
Derek,Here's something un-ironic.
Derek," Ever since you've been hanging out with that meathead, you've become completely lame."
April Ludgate, You know what? We're breaking up.
Derek," Fine, then you can't make out with me when you're drunk anymore."
April Ludgate," Fine, then I'll make out with Ben."
Ben, Pass.
Derek," No, he's my boyfriend."
Derek, You can either make out with both of us or none of us.
April Ludgate," Fine, none of you."
Ben, Fine.
Andy Dwyer," I've got you, Under my skin"
Ron Swanson,"Everything okay, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"My boyfriend is a lawyer, and he's smart and interesting, and there's a lot of things about him I like."
Leslie Knope, But he acted like a real jerk today.
Leslie Knope, I don't know.
Leslie Knope, There's something about the way he treats people or something.
Ron Swanson, He's a tourist.
Ron Swanson," He vacations in people's lives, takes pictures, puts them in his scrapbook, and moves on."
Ron Swanson, All he's interested in are stories.
Leslie Knope, Huh.
Ron Swanson," Basically, Leslie, he's selfish."
Ron Swanson, And you're not.
Ron Swanson, And that's why you don't like him.
Extra, I told you so.
Extra, It's Duke Silver.
Extra," Duke, can I have your autograph? I love your music."
Ron Swanson," You're mistaken, ladies."
Ron Swanson, Move along.
Andy Dwyer, I got you under my skin
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate, Go Mouse Rat.
Extra, I thought you were just terrific.
Andy Dwyer, Seriously?
Extra,You sound like Dean Martin.
Extra, If I were 50 years younger
Andy Dwyer,What? Wait.
Andy Dwyer," Who's Dean Martin? If I'm not mistaken, that was the old lady version of flashing."
Andy Dwyer, Nailed the gig.
Justin," Look, it's sad, I know."
Justin, But we'll still be friends.
Justin, We're gonna see each other all the time.
Justin," I come into town, like, every other weekend."
Tom Haverford, No.
Tom Haverford, You guys can't break up.
Tom Haverford, We can fix this.
Tom Haverford, Let me talk to Leslie.
Justin," Tom, it's over."
Justin, She doesn't wanna see me anymore.
Tom Haverford, Is it my fault? Did I do something wrong?
Justin,No.
Justin," Seriously, this has nothing to do with you."
Tom Haverford, Can we still go suit shopping?
Justin,Of course.
Justin, Armani's having a sale right now.
Justin, I'm gonna get you a pocket square.
Tom Haverford, All right.

Men's Soccer Coach,Are you kidding?
Men's Soccer Coach,"""I was here first""?"
Men's Soccer Coach,Get lost!
Ian Winston,We were here first.
Men's Soccer Coach,But we're scheduled for this time on this field.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is no way for adults to act in front of children."
Leslie Knope,"You're not only coaches, you're also role models."
Men's Soccer Coach,I would hardly call what he does coaching.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Excellent role modeling.
Leslie Knope,"Apparently, the girls' team does not have a field assigned to them for practice, but the boys' team does."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,"Every child has the right to play, no matter how boring the sport."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Could you just share the field with the girls today, please?"
Ian Winston,I'm the girls' coach.
Ian Winston,She's the boys' coach.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Men's Soccer Coach,That's sexist.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Ian Winston,Yeah.
Ian Winston,It kind of is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, why don't the boys take the field today."
Leslie Knope,And then I will make sure that the girls get a place to practice by the end of the week.
Leslie Knope,"And that, little lady, is a Leslie Knope promise!"
Child,I'm a boy.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,'Cause I wasn't talking to you.
Leslie Knope,I was talking to you.
Leslie Knope,"You're a girl, right?"
Child,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,She.
Donna Meagle,Mail's here.
Jerry Gergich,Hey.
April Ludgate,Jerry!
April Ludgate,You got soup all over our mail!
April Ludgate,You jerk.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,It's an envelope from the IOW Awards Office!
Leslie Knope,Nobody freak out!
Leslie Knope,Do you know what this means?
Leslie Knope,I am Pawnee's Woman of the Year!
Leslie Knope,The IOW is the Indiana Organization of Women.
Leslie Knope,I have been a dues paying member since I was nine.
Leslie Knope,"And every year, they choose one woman to win the Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award."
Leslie Knope,Winning is every girl's dream.
Leslie Knope,But it's my destiny.
Leslie Knope,And my dream.
Leslie Knope,"Can you read it, please?"
Leslie Knope,Where are my ladies at?
Leslie Knope,Here we go.
April Ludgate,"""The IOW is proud to announce this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award Winner, Ronald Swanson."""
Leslie Knope,Haha.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, pretty funny."
April Ludgate,It says Ronald Swanson.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, it doesn't."
Leslie Knope,I-- That-- No.
Leslie Knope,That-- What?
Leslie Knope,They only honor women.
Leslie Knope,And Ron's the opposite of a woman.
Ron Swanson,What's going on?
April Ludgate,"You're Pawnee's Woman of the Year, it looks like."
Ron Swanson,"Well, it's about time."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,They've obviously made some sort of mistake.
Ron Swanson,Bully for me!
Jerry Gergich,"Congratulations, Ron."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, congratulations."
Donna Meagle,Congrats.
April Ludgate,That's awesome.
Donna Meagle,It's very exciting.
Ron Swanson,"Awards are stupid, which is why I fully intend to decline this nonsense, and recommend it go to Leslie because she works really hard, and I don't."
Ron Swanson,"However, she cares way too much about crap like this, which is why I can't pass up this opportunity to tease her about it."
Ron Swanson,"Well, we can't stand around all day congratulating me on receiving an award from some lousy women's organization."
Ron Swanson,"Back to work, everyone."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Freddy."
Tom Haverford,Good news!
Tom Haverford,"Your liquor license renewal got got, yo."
Freddy,What do you mean by that?
Tom Haverford,I got you temporary approval from the liquor board pending full board authorization and council review.
Tom Haverford,Got got.
Freddy,Thank you.
Freddy,Thank you so much.
Tom Haverford,No worries.
Tom Haverford,You know the Snakehole's my favorite Pawnee hot spot.
Tom Haverford,I want to open up my own club one day.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe call it something like Cluba-Dub-Dub or The Clubmarine, sort of a submarine themed club."
Tom Haverford,Or Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford,"The word ""bistro"" is classy as [bleep]."
Freddy,"Tom, we are looking for a few top quality guys like yourself to become part owners."
Freddy,"A guy like you, with your political connections, I think you'd make a great asset."
Tom Haverford,I agree.
Tom Haverford,That's why I got into public service.
Tom Haverford,To help me.
Freddy,All right.
Freddy,"10,000 dollars a share."
Freddy,I need the money by Friday.
Tom Haverford,10000 dollars.
Tom Haverford,That's chump change.
Tom Haverford,"I will see you Friday with 10,000 dollars."
Freddy,"All right, partner."
Leslie Knope,I just don't get why the IOW would give that award to Ron.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, it's a bummer."
Leslie Knope,"One, he's not a woman."
Leslie Knope,"And two, they mentioned the Camp Athena project in that letter."
Leslie Knope,That's my project.
Leslie Knope,I started that.
Leslie Knope,It was my brainchild.
Leslie Knope,Why would Ron start a camp for troubled girls?
Mark Brendanawicz,He wouldn't?
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,I deserve that award.
Leslie Knope,That award is mine.
Leslie Knope,Not his.
Leslie Knope,It's mine.
Mark Brendanawicz,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,"I know, I already started a list."
Leslie Knope,"""Write an email to Barack Obama."""
Leslie Knope,"""Lock myself in my office and scream until I lose my voice."""
Leslie Knope,That's all I have so far.
Mark Brendanawicz,I was gonna suggest maybe you just go and talk to him.
Mark Brendanawicz,You're only gonna get more resentful if you don't.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,How--
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,I have so much I need to tell you right now.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ann."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie would like to talk to you for a moment.
Mark Brendanawicz,Is that all right?
Mark Brendanawicz,Good.
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Big T!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What it do, nephew?"
Tom Haverford,"Jean-Ralphio, I have a hot investment opportunity that you are gonna wanna jump all over."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hit me with it, daddy."
Tom Haverford,The Snakehole Lounge--
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Heard of it.
Tom Haverford,Is looking for investors.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No way.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yesterday, if you would have asked me, I would've said no, but thank God, my grandfather just died, so I am a flush with cash!"
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,"I have 4,000 bucks."
Tom Haverford,All I need you to do is kick in six G's.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Six G's.
Tom Haverford,And then you and I are part owners of the hottest nightclub in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"Also, sorry about your grandpa."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No worries.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,He was a dick.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Here's the thing.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I can kick in five G's.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That should be enough, right?"
Tom Haverford,"No, it's not enough."
Tom Haverford,I just said I need six G's.
Tom Haverford,What about your trust fund?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,My parents had it amended.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I don't get anything until I'm 50, which is a waste, 'cause I'm gonna be a billionaire in Costa Rica by then, eating dolphins and hanging out with lady singers."
Tom Haverford,It's not a huge deal.
Tom Haverford,Just sit tight.
Tom Haverford,I'll take care of it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You wanna come home with me?
April Ludgate,Don't you work at Lady Foot Locker?
Burly,"Look, if you're not gonna pay rent, at least clean up your dishes."
Andy Dwyer,Is that all?
Burly,No.
Burly,"Also, The Bag of Smells was a fun experiment, but it has to stop."
Andy Dwyer,Come on!
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,We're finally starting to get serious results.
Burly,"Andy, dude, I love you, but shape up or move out."
April Ludgate,What's going on?
Andy Dwyer,The guitarist from my band is driving me crazy.
Andy Dwyer,He's such a control freak.
Andy Dwyer,"""That's not a working fireplace, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Stop writing phone messages on the wall, Andy."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Dude, seriously, I love you but stop digging that weird hole in the backyard."""
April Ludgate,Is Mouse Rat gonna break up?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, we're not Mouse Rat anymore."
Andy Dwyer,We changed it to Tackleshaft.
April Ludgate,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,I should just get my own place.
April Ludgate,You should.
April Ludgate,I'll help you.
Andy Dwyer,You can help me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that'd be fun."
Andy Dwyer,"April, you're like an angel with no wings."
April Ludgate,"So, like, a person?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What's in the envelope?
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me?
Leslie Knope,I think the Pawnee Chapter of the IOW has made a little mistake.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,You're saying a women's organization made a mistake?
Leslie Knope,I was as surprised as you were.
Leslie Knope,"But the fact is, they only give that award to women."
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,"Well, it definitely said Ron Swanson in the letter."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, but it also mentioned my camp project."
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Camp Xena.
Leslie Knope,Athena.
Leslie Knope,Camp Athena.
Leslie Knope,You don't even know the name.
Ron Swanson,I almost got it.
Ron Swanson,I was pretty close.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,"Look, Leslie, your job, which you're great at, is making me look good."
Ron Swanson,Which you've clearly done well because I'm getting an award.
Ron Swanson,Right?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Be proud of yourself.
Ron Swanson,You deserve an award.
Ron Swanson,"Not this one, obviously, this one belongs to me, but some other one."
Ron Swanson,Some other lesser award.
Ron Swanson,"And if the shoe were on the other foot and you won the award, I would've congratulated you."
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Ron Swanson,What's that?
Leslie Knope,You heard me.
Ian Winston,You promised the girls a field by the end of this week.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a man's world, Winston."
Leslie Knope,Get used to it.
Ian Winston,I'm a man.
Leslie Knope,You know who you should talk to?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,He's an award winning public servant.
Leslie Knope,He's the guy that's gonna help you out.
Leslie Knope,Go on in there.
April Ludgate,Excuse me?
April Ludgate,"Ron, someone's coming in."
Ian Winston,Hi.
Ian Winston,Leslie said I should come over here.
Leslie Knope,"If you don't get credit for your work, why bother doing it?"
Leslie Knope,Because I love it!
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to make a point!
Tom Haverford,This VIP card gives you exclusive access to the investment opportunity of a lifetime.
Tom Haverford,Where?
Tom Haverford,Multipurpose Room F.
Tom Haverford,When?
Tom Haverford,3:00 p.m.
Tom Haverford,Dress code?
Tom Haverford,Black tie optional.
Tom Haverford,Just like life.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, yes."
Ron Swanson,Just hang on one second.
Ron Swanson,I'm doing my official portrait for the IUD Awards Dinner Program.
Leslie Knope,IOW.
Ron Swanson,"No, this portrait is not official in any way."
Ron Swanson,I'm paying for it myself.
Leslie Knope,Did you need me?
Leslie Knope,Because some of us actually do work around here.
Leslie Knope,Work that often goes unrewarded.
Ron Swanson,I need your opinion.
Ron Swanson,Which of these objects most represents women for this portrait?
Ron Swanson,A pot?
Ron Swanson,Or this Deputy Director Barbie?
Ron Swanson,Isn't it adorable?
Ron Swanson,"She's got a little briefcase, her cell phone."
Ron Swanson,"""I'm going to help my boss win an award."""
Leslie Knope,How's the scheduling conflict with the soccer teams going?
Leslie Knope,"Take care of that, did you?"
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Passed the buck to Donna.
Leslie Knope,That's not really the attitude I'd expect from an award winner.
Ron Swanson,Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I've won an award.
April Ludgate,"So, what kind of place are you looking for?"
Andy Dwyer,"I can afford, like, 300 bucks a month. I've always wanted a doorman named Ernie."
Andy Dwyer,That'd be awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Or Kipp.
Andy Dwyer,I'm pretty flexible on that.
April Ludgate,Here's a great one.
April Ludgate,It's a Tudor mansion.
April Ludgate,"It's got seven rooms, four bathrooms."
April Ludgate,"It's got a tennis court, a pool and a three car garage."
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,"And it's only 20,000 dollars a month."
April Ludgate,And it's in Chicago.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,That close!
Andy Dwyer,It was almost perfect.
April Ludgate,"Actually, there are a couple of cool places in here."
Andy Dwyer,Let's go look at them!
April Ludgate,Now?
Andy Dwyer,Let's roll.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Thank you all so much for joining me today.
Tom Haverford,I have two questions for you.
Tom Haverford,"One, are you ready for the investment opportunity of a lifetime?"
Tom Haverford,"And two, do any of you have pacemakers or a history of epilepsy?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, both."
Tom Haverford,Anybody?
Tom Haverford,No?
Jerry Gergich,Both.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Ladies!
Tom Haverford,Jay-Z.
Tom Haverford,Rihanna.
Tom Haverford,Audrina Patridge.
Tom Haverford,Jon Gosselin.
Tom Haverford,Lady Gaga.
Tom Haverford,Snooki.
Jerry Gergich,Are these real people?
Tom Haverford,Cash Warren and Dennis Rodman.
Tom Haverford,These are just a few of the celebrities that wish they could invest in Pawnee's hottest club.
Tom Haverford,But they can't.
Tom Haverford,And you can.
Tom Haverford,"For the small price of only one, one, one, thousand, thousand, thousand dollars, dollars, dollars!"
Tom Haverford,"The only question is, who's gonna be my partner?"
Tom Haverford,"Mark, I'm talking to you!"
Tom Haverford,"Donna, I'm talking to you!"
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,I'm talking to you!
Tom Haverford,Mark!
Tom Haverford,I'm talking to you!
Leslie Knope,"Twenty-six certificates , plaques, ribbons, trophies, medals and miscellany certifying that I am the kind of person who deserves recognition for her achievements."
Ron Swanson,"What do you have, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,I have the Dorothy Every Time Smurf Girl Trophy for excellence in female stuff.
Leslie Knope,Dorothy Everton Smythe.
Leslie Knope,"I swear to God, I would--"
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"Before you continue, please read this."
Leslie Knope,Another organization giving you credit for something you didn't do?
Leslie Knope,"""I, Ron Swanson, recognize that Leslie Knope should have received the IOW Award for all the hard work she has done, especially for the Camp Athena project."""
Leslie Knope,"""However, in my opinion, she is far too concerned with institutional gratification."""
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"""So, I am going to let her dangle in order to show her that awards are bull crap."""
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Leslie, you know I'm not sexist."
Ron Swanson,I love powerful women.
Leslie Knope,You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.
Ron Swanson,"I'm just saying that awards are political, and everybody has an agenda."
Ron Swanson,"If you spend your life chasing them, you'll drive yourself nuts."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope,But Dorothy Everton Smythe was a trailblazing feminist.
Leslie Knope,She was the first woman in Pawnee to wear pants on a Sunday.
Leslie Knope,She spent four years in jail for that.
Leslie Knope,"I know I'm not supposed to care about these things, but this one means a lot."
Andy Dwyer,I know you've been changing--
Andy Dwyer,The acoustics in the bathroom are insane.
April Ludgate,"So, how much is this one again?"
Realtor,"This one is 425 a month, plus utilities."
Andy Dwyer,I like it.
Andy Dwyer,"It seems to have a lot of potential and a lot of ""advantages,"" per se."
Andy Dwyer,I could definitely picture myself doing something over there.
Andy Dwyer,Can you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Realtor,It's still on.
Andy Dwyer,You can light a match to get rid of that smell.
Andy Dwyer,I feel really good about this.
April Ludgate,Really?
Andy Dwyer,It screams Andy Dwyer.
April Ludgate,And I live nearby.
April Ludgate,"So, we could, like, carpool to work or something."
Andy Dwyer,Are you serious?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,The scream just got louder.
Realtor,"So, what do you think?"
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,Make me an offer.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"First come, first served."
Tom Haverford,Who's in?
Tom Haverford,Jerry?
Jerry Gergich,"Jeez, Tom, if I spend any more than 25 bucks, I gotta ask my wife."
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, get out."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"""Mark? What are we doing tonight?"""
Tom Haverford,"""I don't know, Ann."""
Tom Haverford,"""We could do the usual boring stuff like eat some chicken salad with some crackers, or watch the payperview, or we could go to my nightclub and do some dancing."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't think so, man."
Tom Haverford,You'd never have to beg for sex again.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't wanna get into this, really, but I don't beg for sex now."
Tom Haverford,"Forget about that, Mark."
Tom Haverford,Are you in or out?
Mark Brendanawicz,It's just not really my thing.
Cindy,"Bye, Mark."
Mark Brendanawicz,Cindy.
Tom Haverford,Donna?
Donna Meagle,Maybe.
Donna Meagle,I like The Snakehole.
Donna Meagle,"Plus, I would look good pulling into my owner's parking space in my Mercedes."
Tom Haverford,"Just to be clear, you wouldn't be an owner, per se."
Tom Haverford,"You, me and my boy, Jean-Ralphio, would each own part of a share."
Tom Haverford,Will that be cash or check?
Donna Meagle,Not so fast.
Donna Meagle,I like to know who I'm in business with.
Donna Meagle,I want to meet your boy.
April Ludgate,In here.
April Ludgate,This lady's here.
Elise Yarktin,"Hi, I'm Elise Yarktin, I'm with the IOW."
Ron Swanson,"I'm Woman of the Year, Ron Swanson."
Elise Yarktin,"Yes, I know."
Elise Yarktin,We are very excited to be presenting you with the Smythe Award.
Ron Swanson,That's what I called you to talk about.
Ron Swanson,I don't know if I can take all of the excitement.
Ron Swanson,"So, I think the award should go to Miss Knope, here."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Ron Swanson,She's the one who really deserves it.
Ron Swanson,Camp Athena was her idea.
Ron Swanson,She did all the work.
Ron Swanson,You made a mistake.
Elise Yarktin,We didn't make a mistake.
Elise Yarktin,We made a very conscious decision this year to choose a man.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Elise Yarktin,"Well, every year, we give it to a woman, and, frankly, nobody cares."
Elise Yarktin,"Yeah, the media has all but written us off as a niche interest group."
Elise Yarktin,"But if you give a women's award to a mustachioed, masculine man, such as yourself, well, then, eventually, people take notice."
Ron Swanson,I don't want the damn thing.
Elise Yarktin,"Well, we're giving it to you."
Elise Yarktin,"So, you're gonna take it, like a man."
Elise Yarktin,So congratulations.
Leslie Knope,"The IOW is a bunch of sexist jerks who need to get back in the kitchen where they belong, and leave the real feminist work to actual feminists like Ron Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Ron Swanson, Now do you see how silly these things are?
Leslie Knope, Unbelievable.
Ron Swanson," Obviously, I'm just gonna decline it."
Leslie Knope," No, I want you to accept it."
Leslie Knope, I want you to go to the podium and talk about how stupid awards are.
Leslie Knope, And how they are superficial and meaningless.
Leslie Knope, I want you to rip awards a new a-hole!
Ron Swanson,Now we're talking.
Ron Swanson, I tell you what.
Ron Swanson, You write the speech.
Ron Swanson, Don't pull your punches.
Leslie Knope, I won't.
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna push my punches as far as my fists can extend!
Ron Swanson,Attagirl.
Ron Swanson, Kind of.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," What up, Big T! Stop."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, This must be the lovely Donna.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Enchante.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Listen, beautiful, let's cut the bull, right? You want this."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I definitely want this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,T.H. wants this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Let's seal this devil's three way right here, right now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Step one, we buy into this club."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Step two, we roll over to the club, either in your Mercedes Benz or my pre-owned Acura Legend."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Step three, I dagger you on the dance floor."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce-- Now, all the ladies say it, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce. What do you say, sexy?"
Donna Meagle,I'm out.
Tom Haverford, Why?
Donna Meagle,I hate that guy.
Elise Yarktin,Mr. Swanson.
Elise Yarktin," Hi, welcome to the IOW Awards, and congratulations on winning."
Ron Swanson, Yay!
Elise Yarktin,"Well, here is your awards packet, and if you will just follow me, we're gonna have a little meet-and-greet before the ceremony."
Ron Swanson, Okay.
Elise Yarktin, Great.
Elise Yarktin," No, I'm sorry."
Elise Yarktin, This area is for award winners only.
Leslie Knope," Get over yourself, Elise."
Ron Swanson, Work on the speech.
Ron Swanson, Let's nail these women.
Ron Swanson, You know what I mean.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Tom Haverford," I don't know, Andy."
Tom Haverford, What's it all about? What's the secret?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Tom Haverford," Why's it so hard to become a mogul? All I want in life is to own a nightclub on every continent, have my own line of upscale sweat suits, and a cologne called Tommy Fresh."
Tom Haverford," And I fell 1,000 dollars short."
Andy Dwyer," Seriously? That's all you needed? Tom, I have 1,000 dollars."
Andy Dwyer, You can have it.
Tom Haverford," Thanks, Andy, but I can't take your money."
Andy Dwyer, I'm a singer songwriter.
Andy Dwyer," The two lines I've put into every song I've ever sang, ""Spread your wings and fly,"" and ""You deserve to be a champion."""
Andy Dwyer,"If you're telling me that all you need is 1,000 dollars to do your dreams, then I want you to have it."
Tom Haverford, Are you sure about this?
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.
Tom Haverford, You don't know how happy you just made me.
Elise Yarktin, He's the Director of the Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department.
Elise Yarktin, He is also the recipient of this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award.
Elise Yarktin, Please put your hands together for Mr. Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
Ron Swanson," Every award, from the smallest trophy to the Nobel Prize, is nothing more than... Is nothing more than a great way to honor someone."
Ron Swanson," So, I would like to present this year's Dottie English Whatever Award to the person who actually deserves it, Leslie Knope."
Ron Swanson," Come on up here, Leslie."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, I don't know what to say.
Leslie Knope," Honestly, I'm just very honored to work for someone as insightful and kind as my boss."
Leslie Knope," So, I would like to present this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe Award to Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson, I don't want it.
Ron Swanson, Just take the damn thing.
Leslie Knope, You deserve it.
Ron Swanson," No, no."
Ron Swanson, Really.
Leslie Knope," No, Ron, you deserve it."
Ron Swanson," Really, but I don't want it."
Leslie Knope, But you won it.
Leslie Knope, And you should win it.
Ron Swanson, You should take it.
Ron Swanson, After that whole conversation--
Leslie Knope,I'm being ridiculous.
Ron Swanson, You've done--
Elise Yarktin,Could someone please just take it?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take it."
Leslie Knope, Who do I speak to about getting this changed?
Audience Member,Get off the stage!
Audience Member,Yeah!
Ron Swanson,I still think awards are stupid.
Ron Swanson, But they'd be less stupid if they went to the right people.
April Ludgate, You gave Tom all your money?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, well, I'm investing."
Andy Dwyer," I'm like Warren ""Buffay."""
April Ludgate, I kind of feel like it would have been good for you to have your own place.
Andy Dwyer," Yeah, I know."
Andy Dwyer," But I feel like Tom really needed the money, and small sacrifice to see one of your best friends' dreams come true."
Ron Swanson, They cropped you out.
Leslie Knope, Figures.
Ron Swanson," So, where are you gonna put it?"
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope," One, two, three."
Ron Swanson," Two, three."
Tom Haverford, What's up?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, guys."
Tom Haverford, How long did you wait in line? I didn't wait at all! I'm a part owner.
Tom Haverford, Freddy! I'm back.
Tom Haverford," Tom Haverford, part owner."
Tom Haverford, Let me know if you need anything.
Tom Haverford, Keep this booth warm for me every night.
Tom Haverford, I'm gonna live in this booth.
Tom Haverford," Yes, sir."
Tom Haverford, Donna? What are you doing here?
Donna Meagle,I bought three shares.
Donna Meagle, Thanks for the tip.

Tom Haverford,"What's happening, sweetheart?"
Ann Perkins,Just waiting for April.
Ann Perkins,"She's taking care of my house while I'm away, so--"
Tom Haverford,That's great.
Tom Haverford,Happy belated Valentine's Day.
Ann Perkins,Valentine's Day was a month ago.
Ann Perkins,Why are you giving it to me now?
Tom Haverford,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,Happy early Valentine's Day.
Tom Haverford,I saw this and I thought of you.
Tom Haverford,Hope you keep that somewhere special.

Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"It's a regular, cameraless teddy bear."
Tom Haverford,"Just put it in your bedroom, don't even think about it."
Tom Haverford,It's a robot bear.
Tom Haverford,It's programmed to snuggle!
Donna Meagle,I'll take it.
Ann Perkins,"Donna, there's a camera in it."
Donna Meagle,I know.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,That's basically it.
Ann Perkins,"Water the plants, get the mail."
April Ludgate,Can I read your mail?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"Please, don't."
April Ludgate,Fine.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"And here are the keys, and remember--"
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,Don't let Tom make a copy.
Ann Perkins,That's right.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,I'm paying April 50 bucks to watch my house while I'm away.
Ann Perkins,"I would have asked Leslie, but I've seen the way she takes care of her house."
Ann Perkins,"Plus, there's always been a little distance between me and April."
Ann Perkins,"And I thought this would maybe, I don't know, give us a chance to get a little closer."
Ann Perkins,Maybe even--
April Ludgate,I don't like Ann.
Ann Perkins,Become friends.
Ann Perkins,Who knows?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Evelyn Rowshlind, from the mayor's office."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello!"
Leslie Knope,I've always dreamed of you.
Evelyn Rowshlind,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,Meeting you.
Leslie Knope,What can I do for you?
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Evelyn Rowshlind,I prefer to stand.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Evelyn Rowshlind,I have kind of an odd favor to ask.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Mayor Gunderson was playing golf last week at Pawnee Municipal, and he brought his dog and--"
Leslie Knope,Rufus.
Leslie Knope,We all know Rufus.
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves Rufus.
Leslie Knope,He's a great dog.
Leslie Knope,Continue.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, they were out on the sixth hole when suddenly, out of nowhere--"
Leslie Knope,Rufus was bitten by a possum?
Evelyn Rowshlind,Yes.
Evelyn Rowshlind,How did you know that?
Leslie Knope,It was Fairway Frank.
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank is this awful possum who lives near the sixth hole of the public golf course.
Leslie Knope,"And he's actually number three on the Parks Department's Most Wanted Pest List, right behind the bats, who like to poop on the bell tower, and Poopy, the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria."
Ron Swanson,Shouldn't you take this up with Animal Control?
Evelyn Rowshlind,Let's be honest.
Evelyn Rowshlind,Animal Control is not the most effective branch of our government.
Leslie Knope,They're a bunch of burned out morons.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, you have the reputation as a person who gets things done, so we'd like you to form a little task force, find the animal and put it down."
Leslie Knope,A task force?
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Needless to say, the mayor will be very grateful for your help."
Leslie Knope,"Ma'am, the next time we speak, we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum."
Evelyn Rowshlind,Great.
Leslie Knope,Ron will show you around.
Ron Swanson,Right this way is the exit.
April Ludgate,"Yo, police!"
Andy Dwyer,"No, you're not."
Andy Dwyer,Coffee!
Andy Dwyer,You always know what to bring me.
April Ludgate,I only ever bring you coffee.
Andy Dwyer,"And it is my very favorite non-alcoholic hot drink, except for hot tea."
Andy Dwyer,"And hot orange juice, weirdly delicious."
Andy Dwyer,"Anyways, thank you so much."
Andy Dwyer,I need it.
Andy Dwyer,I got a really bad case of shoeshine head today.
April Ludgate,"Andy recently diagnosed himself with what he calls ""shoeshine head."""
April Ludgate,It's when you shine too many shoes and the fumes create a thunderstorm in your brain.
April Ludgate,"Cures include coffee, cheeseburgers and napping on the floor."
Ron Swanson,Mark Brendanawicz!
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hey, Ron, what's up?"
Ron Swanson,"I have a woodshop, and I'm planning a little expansion."
Ron Swanson,"Need my buddy, Mark the city planner, to sign off on the plans."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Sure, I just need to schedule an inspection."
Ron Swanson,That's not really necessary.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yes, it is."
Mark Brendanawicz,But you'll be fine as long as you don't have any code violations.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You don't have any code violations, do you?"
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Eugene!
Leslie Knope,"Boy, we have a really important job for you."
Eugene,We'll get to it first thing Monday.
Leslie Knope,Today's Wednesday.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is not a request."
Andy Dwyer,We're acting under direct orders from Mayor Gunderson's dog.
Leslie Knope,Office.
Leslie Knope,I need your two best guys to join me and be part of my task force.
Eugene,That would be Harris and Brett.
Eugene,But they're not here.
Tom Haverford,"Isn't that them, there?"
Eugene,Nope.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Brett."
Brett,Yeah?
Harris,Dude.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, that stupid possum is on the golf course again."
Leslie Knope,"Would you rather I capture it myself, and then just call you, so you can come and pick it up?"
Eugene,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Cool!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you want your ball back?"
Leslie Knope,Want your ball back?
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Harris,"Oh, man!"
Brett,"How you know my name, homie?"
Harris,"Stop, man!"
Brett,Stop hanging yourself.
Harris,I'm gonna hang yourself.
Brett,Stop hanging yourself.
Tom Haverford,"It's quite a crack team you've assembled, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, there's five of us and only one possum."
Leslie Knope,How hard can it be?
Leslie Knope,Excuse us!
Leslie Knope,Task force coming through!
Leslie Knope,Task force clear.
Leslie Knope,Resume golfing.
Tom Haverford,I used to love Tiger Woods because he was a great champion.
Tom Haverford,But after that sex scandal?
Tom Haverford,The man is a god!
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Mark."
Ron Swanson,Welcome to my haven.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,You are the first non-me to set foot in this building in 10 years.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, none of this is up to code."
Ron Swanson,Sure it is.
Ron Swanson,It's up to the Swanson Code.
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no drainage.
Mark Brendanawicz,Doesn't seem to be any ventilation.
Mark Brendanawicz,You've got hazardous chemicals over here.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, which only I'm breathing."
Ron Swanson,It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car.
Ron Swanson,Are you gonna tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?
Mark Brendanawicz,There is a basket of oil soaked rags above a wood burning stove.
Ron Swanson,"Good thing I've got a fire extinguisher, which, I can assure you, is totally up to your precious code."
Mark Brendanawicz,This says it should be recharged June of 1996.
Ron Swanson,Those dates are arbitrary.
Ron Swanson,They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.
Ron Swanson,Observe.
Ron Swanson,Watch yourself.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'll replace this.
Ron Swanson,Happy?
Tom Haverford,"How long do you think it would take me to learn golf, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,I could teach you.
Leslie Knope,I have a 16 handicap.
Leslie Knope,"But, you know, it takes a lot of practice."
Leslie Knope,"You have to get up early, hit the range, practice reading greens."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I don't want to do all that."
Tom Haverford,I think I just want some of those dope pants.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,It's Fairway Frank!
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I want you to very slowly…"
Tom Haverford,Move!
Tom Haverford,Get out of the way!
Mark Brendanawicz,"25, 26, 27, 28 violations."
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Brendanawicz, relax."
Ron Swanson,Let me make you a canoe.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I don't need a canoe, Ron."
Mark Brendanawicz,I need you to fix this place up.
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, I'll give you 24 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we may only get one chance to catch this thing, so we have to play it smart."
Leslie Knope,"You two, flank the left."
Leslie Knope,I'll flank the right.
Leslie Knope,Andy will come in to--
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I got it!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Task force, engage!"
Andy Dwyer,I got him!
Harris,He's got it.
Brett,He's good.
Andy Dwyer,I got him.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, you cowards!"
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face.
Leslie Knope,Let me see his face!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,That's him!
Leslie Knope,We got him!
Andy Dwyer,It's okay.
Andy Dwyer,He's on my neck!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, okay, okay!"
Andy Dwyer,He's on my neck!
Leslie Knope,"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
Leslie Knope,"All right, it's okay."
Leslie Knope,"You're next, Poopy."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Very impressive, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,I had a great task force.
Leslie Knope,I was just the simple mastermind who planned the whole operation and executed it to perfection.
Leslie Knope,"This is Andy Dwyer, he actually caught the thing."
Evelyn Rowshlind,Mr. Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,"Please, my friends call me Andy Radical."
Tom Haverford,"No, we don't."
Andy Dwyer,"By day, Andy Dwyer, shoeshineist."
Andy Dwyer,"By a different time of day, Andy Radical, possum tackler."
Andy Dwyer,"And by night, I do whatever I want."
Andy Dwyer,No job.
Evelyn Rowshlind,We think that this is a great PR opportunity.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"So, we've arranged for a reporter from the Journal to stop by to interview, get some pictures of the team."
Leslie Knope,Task force.
Leslie Knope,Great!
Evelyn Rowshlind,"And next time you need a special favor from the mayor's office, give me a call."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I will!"
Leslie Knope,I need so many special favors.
Leslie Knope,Which one should I choose?
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, you don't have to choose right--"
Leslie Knope,How about an extra recycling can?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Laminated bus pass?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What time do you usually go to sleep?
Leslie Knope,Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Let's stick to business hours, shall we?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, all right."
Evelyn Rowshlind,"See you in hell, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Am I quite sure?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Am I sure enough?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?"
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,Could I live with myself?
Leslie Knope,That depends.
Leslie Knope,"As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions."
Leslie Knope,Does doing so help me make decisions?
Leslie Knope,Uh…
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Shauna."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,"You remember Shauna Malwee-Tweep, from the Pawnee Journal?"
Andy Dwyer,How could I forget?
Andy Dwyer,You wrote the article when I fell in the pit.
Andy Dwyer,"And then afterwards, had sex with Mark and everyone talked about it."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, you're on the golf course, and you see Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,"So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum."
Andy Dwyer,"Let me explain something to you, Tweep."
Andy Dwyer,"When you're in a situation, you don't have time to think."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I thought to myself, ""Don't think, Andy, act."""
Tom Haverford,"So, you weren't thinking?"
Andy Dwyer,Not at all.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Were you scared?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I wasn't."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I I lived in the pit for the better part of last year, and made some vermin friends."
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,"""Friends"" sounds stupid."
Andy Dwyer,Colleagues.
Andy Dwyer,"They are bad at sharing, but they are good at tag."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, your family must be very proud."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What does your girlfriend think?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The nurse.
Andy Dwyer,I broke up with Ann.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Shortly after she kicked me out and told me we wouldn't be together anymore.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, maybe this article will change her mind."
Andy Dwyer,What now?
Andy Dwyer,I hadn't even thought of that.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Of all the things I thought would bring us back together, catching a possum was never on that list."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, let's go take some pictures of Fairway Frank."
Leslie Knope,Of the possum.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, man, when you wear these clothes, you just feel better than everyone else."
Tom Haverford,You know?
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Busy?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,What's up?
Ron Swanson,"Just wanted to tell you, I understand that city codes exist, and I know why they exist."
Ron Swanson,And I understand that you enforce them.
Mark Brendanawicz,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Good talk.
Ron Swanson,Can you sign off on my plans now?
Mark Brendanawicz,Did you get everything up to code?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, you didn't!"
mr,You clearly didn't!
Ron Swanson,"It's my property, my land, my shop."
Tom Haverford,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,Tommy needs a banana.
Tom Haverford,You guys good?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, you're asking me to do a bad job at my job, and I'm just not gonna do that."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, if you don't mind, would you please just get out of my office?"
Tom Haverford,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,Silly me.
Tom Haverford,There was this little pom-pom on my glove and it fell off.
Tom Haverford,Have you seen it?
Tom Haverford,Could you help me look for it real quick?
Tom Haverford,It should be on the ground somewhere.
Tom Haverford,When I was putting it up.
Tom Haverford,Let's see.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, how's your hole?"
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The pit.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Lot 48.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we're making really good progress on the park."
Leslie Knope,"In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card."
Leslie Knope,"So, this isn't a really big story, right?"
Leslie Knope,Nobody cares about this very much.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, Fairway Frank did bite the mayor's dog."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, this could be on the front page."
Andy Dwyer,"Fairway Frank, You're gonna die, You're gonna fry, oh, yeah, You guilty son of a bitch, You're gonna fry, When they flip that switch."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?"
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale."
Leslie Knope,"And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,"But then you thought, maybe it's not a whale."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a big fish.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?"
April Ludgate,I don't know what you're talking about.
Leslie Knope,I saw a second possum!
Leslie Knope,There was another possum!
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,"Andy's in there talking to a reporter, literally kissing his own biceps and you're telling me he might not be a hero, but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I've gotta help Leslie find the truth.
April Ludgate,"Not because I'm pissed at Andy, which I'm not."
April Ludgate,Because I care so deeply about possums.
April Ludgate,Because they're so adorable.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Did you see my photo shoot?
Andy Dwyer,I think I nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,"I fell off the stool once when I was trying to look serious, but I'm okay."
April Ludgate,That's cool.
April Ludgate,I'm really happy for you.
Andy Dwyer,You are?
Andy Dwyer,"Man, our happy reactions are super different."
Andy Dwyer,"So, he said he's gonna email me the photos in, like, six hours."
Andy Dwyer,Do you want to wait with me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that sounds good, but I can't because I have to go do something that actually matters."
Leslie Knope,Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.
Leslie Knope,You must know him pretty well.
Joe Campopiano,Sure do.
Joe Campopiano,I've chased that little sucker off more times than I can count.
April Ludgate,Can you just take a look at these photos and make sure that it's Fairway Frank?
Joe Campopiano,"Yup, that's him."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Campopiano, those are photos of three different possums."
Joe Campopiano,Huh.
Joe Campopiano,You guys want something to drink?
Mike,"Hey, boss."
Mike,There's a possum wandering around on the 14th green.
Mike,Should I call Animal Control again?
Joe Campopiano,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Those idiots are here from Animal Control.
Leslie Knope,They're gonna take it away.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Can you do that, April?"
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do that?"
Leslie Knope,Can you get the possum out of here?
Leslie Knope,Can you sneak it out of here?
Leslie Knope,"April, can you do it?"
Leslie Knope,Can you do it?
Leslie Knope,"Please, April, tell me you can do it!"
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I can do it."
April Ludgate, God.
Leslie Knope," I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent."
Leslie Knope," I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty."
Leslie Knope," I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word ""lieutenant."""
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now.
Brett," Let's make it happen, Captain."
Harris, Don't call me that.
Leslie Knope,"Help! Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding!"
Jerry Gergich,Holy cow! Leslie!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope," Oh, look how much it's bleeding."
Leslie Knope, Everybody look at it.
Leslie Knope, Everybody look over here! I need everyone's full attention during this.
Jerry Gergich, That's a lot of blood.
Leslie Knope," It is, it's so--"
Donna Meagle,It's ketchup!
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope, Jerry.
Jerry Gergich, Yes.
Jerry Gergich, It's ketchup.
TV, Sentry duty is usually approximately one hour long.
TV, Baby meerkats do not start foraging for food until about one month old.
April Ludgate, Do you know them?
Evelyn Rowshlind,What do you mean that Fairway Frank is not here?
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank."
Evelyn Rowshlind," Leslie, whoever it is, it's a possum."
Evelyn Rowshlind," And the sooner it's dead, the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it."
Leslie Knope, Does he want to have sex with a dead possum?
Evelyn Rowshlind,No!
Leslie Knope,No.
Evelyn Rowshlind, He's not a monster.
Evelyn Rowshlind, He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.
Leslie Knope, Ew!
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Now, Leslie, you did a great job, and the mayor knows that you did a great job."
Evelyn Rowshlind," Now, where is the possum?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out."
Leslie Knope," And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me."
Leslie Knope," But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go."
Leslie Knope, This is interesting.
Leslie Knope, They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island.
Tom Haverford, Wow.
Leslie Knope," And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid."
Leslie Knope, But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose.
Tom Haverford, That's great.
Leslie Knope," No, it's awful, Tom."
Leslie Knope, How would you feel if you killed an innocent duck and let a vicious goose waddle free?
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
April Ludgate," Tom! It's April, I'm at Ann's house and the possum's loose! Okay? I need your help!"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! It's chewing on everything! Don't tell Leslie."
Tom Haverford, You got it.
Tom Haverford, The possum got loose at Ann's house.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"April! April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department."
April Ludgate," Stop ringing the doorbell, it's making him mad."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God! How did this happen?"
April Ludgate,"I let it out of its cage because it needed water, and I thought it would just drink out of the toilet or something, but then it ran off and I couldn't get it back in."
April Ludgate," He did that, too."
Leslie Knope," Oh, boy."
April Ludgate," Yeah, and then I opened all the doors because I thought it would just go outside, but it won't leave the house! It must love tacky pictures of flowers."
Leslie Knope," Okay, okay, okay."
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna fix this.
Leslie Knope, Let me just think for a second.
April Ludgate, Uh-oh.
Leslie Knope, What?
April Ludgate,Where is it?
April Ludgate,I can't see it!
Leslie Knope,"No! Okay, where did it go?"
April Ludgate,I don't know! I don't know.
Leslie Knope," Here's what we do, we just go outside."
Leslie Knope, All right? Let's just go outside! Get in here!
Ron Swanson,I haven't even started yet.
Mark Brendanawicz, I know.
Mark Brendanawicz, Thought you could use some help.
Mark Brendanawicz, Those city planning guys can be real pains in the ass.
Mark Brendanawicz, Okay.
Ron Swanson, I just want you to know that I still don't think city codes--
Mark Brendanawicz,"Ron, shut up."
Mark Brendanawicz," Would you, please?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm taking a half day off to come and help you out because you're my friend, so just shut up."
Ron Swanson," No, I am bringing my workshop up to the Swanson Code."
Ron Swanson, And if the Swanson Code happens to overlap with the City Government Code--
Mark Brendanawicz,Shut up.
Leslie Knope," I know there's a door there, but I kind of feel like it's going to chew through the door and come and jump on my face and bite me."
April Ludgate, Ew.
April Ludgate, I know!
Leslie Knope,What if it's in here?
April Ludgate,What if it laid eggs in the bed?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there, there are no eggs! You know, we should've killed it."
Leslie Knope, It's so huge.
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna call Andy.
April Ludgate, No.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," He tackled it once before, he can do it again."
April Ludgate," No, please don't, okay? He's gonna be pissed at me."
April Ludgate," I already ruined his big day, and it's my fault that it's in Ann's house, who he's obviously still in love with."
April Ludgate," I just-- I don't want him to be mad at me, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope, April.
Leslie Knope, He'll forgive you.
April Ludgate, You think so?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, We don't have to call Andy.
Leslie Knope, We can just call Animal Control.
April Ludgate, Okay.
Leslie Knope," And, April, any time you want to talk about boys--"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God! Stop!"
Andy Dwyer,Yo.
Andy Dwyer," So, I feel like you were mad at me yesterday and I don't know why."
Andy Dwyer," So, I made a list of everything I did and I'm gonna try not to do any of them again."
Andy Dwyer," Also, I got you this coffee."
Andy Dwyer, And then there's this.
Andy Dwyer, Fourth paragraph down.
Andy Dwyer," ""But Dwyer had some help catching the possum."""
April Ludgate," ""'I wouldn't have been able to do it without an early-morning caffeine boost from the amazing April Ludgate."""
April Ludgate," ""She gave me the liquid courage I needed to wrestle that beast to the ground."""
Evelyn Rowshlind,"Well, Miss Knope."
Evelyn Rowshlind, I have to say I'm very disappointed.
Leslie Knope," You didn't have to say that, you could've just thought it."
Evelyn Rowshlind," What did you do with the possum, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it."
Leslie Knope, It's okay.
Leslie Knope, Honestly.
Leslie Knope," I mean, look."
Leslie Knope," When I retire and I'm attending some gala honoring the first three female presidents in history, myself and two other women I've inspired, I want to be looking back at my distinguished legacy and not thinking that I owe my career to some possum."
Leslie Knope," And I want to be wearing a huge, beautiful, blue hat!"
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much.
April Ludgate, Sure.
Ann Perkins, It made me feel so happy that I knew somebody was here taking care of my house.
April Ludgate, Cool.
Ann Perkins," So, did the neighbors give you any problems?"
April Ludgate,No.
Ann Perkins, Anything in--
Leslie Knope,Possum.
Leslie Knope, There was a possum.
Leslie Knope, We captured a possum and we brought it into your house and it got out and it might have laid eggs in your bed.
Ann Perkins, What?
Leslie Knope,"And it went into your laundry and your kitchen, and it touched all your bras and I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope, It's our fault.
Leslie Knope, We captured it and it got out and it ran around and it was a possum.
Leslie Knope," Okay? April, run! Run, April."
Leslie Knope," Sorry, Ann! I love you!"
April Ludgate,I'm gonna go.
Ann Perkins, I think that would be best.

Leslie Knope,Time for the hummingbird lottery.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know how it works.
Leslie Knope,Write your name down on a piece of paper.
Leslie Knope,"No, they don't win a hummingbird."
Leslie Knope,"I installed hummingbird feeders in all the parks, so the winner gets to refill those feeders."
Leslie Knope,"Scientifically, hummingbirds are the world's cutest animals."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're so small."
Leslie Knope,And they have tiny beaks.
Leslie Knope,And they only eat sugar water.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what beats that?"
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,They do.
Leslie Knope,Baby monkeys in diapers are the cutest.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Who's it going to be?
Tom Haverford,Not me.
April Ludgate,Not me.
Jerry Gergich,Not me.
Jerry Gergich,Not me.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,You can stop by tomorrow morning before work.
Jerry Gergich,This is my third time in a row.
Tom Haverford,"Just a bad luck streak, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"Next time, I'm sure it will definitely be one of us."
Tom Haverford,But it won't be me.
Tom Haverford,Because I always write…
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Yep.
Leslie Knope,"No, I always write my own name."
Leslie Knope,"But just to be safe, I do add 20 extra ""Jerry""s."
Leslie Knope,"And finally, we are going to kick off the Children's Concert Series this weekend with a performance by Freddy Spaghetti."
April Ludgate,I thought Freddy Spaghetti OD'd.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's Mr. Funny Noodle.
Leslie Knope,"And he didn't OD, his drummer shot him."
April Ludgate,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Where is Jerry, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,Why isn't he back?
Leslie Knope,How long does it take to fill bird feeders?
Donna Meagle,Maybe he fell into the toilet.
Donna Meagle,Remember when he fell into the toilet?
April Ludgate,"""Oh, sorry, guys."""
April Ludgate,"""Sorry I'm late."""
April Ludgate,"""I got confused and took a shower, after I got dressed, because I'm Jerry."""
Ron Swanson,"David Meyers, the Jewish guy who works at City Hall, once told me something."
Ron Swanson,"A ""schlemiel"" is the guy who spills soup at a fancy party."
Ron Swanson,"A ""schlimazel"" is the guy he spills it on."
Ron Swanson,"Jerry is both the ""schlemiel"" and the ""schlimazel"" of our office."
Tom Haverford,"""And then I put my underwear on my head instead of my butt."""
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,That's enough.
Leslie Knope,Unless somebody has another good one.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, is Jerry okay?"
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with your arm?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, tell me what's wrong with Jerry's arm."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, get Jerry to talk to me."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,He's okay.
Ann Perkins,He's got a couple of scrapes and a dislocated shoulder.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ron Swanson,What happened?
Jerry Gergich,You guys are just going to laugh.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,Did you throw out your shoulder trying to swing a honey pot off your hand?
Leslie Knope,I was mugged.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so sorry, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,I was on my way to the hummingbird feeders and I was walking Lord Sheldon.
April Ludgate,Ew!
April Ludgate,Is that code for some kind of weird sex act?
Jerry Gergich,Lord Sheldon is my dog.
Jerry Gergich,My wife named him.
April Ludgate,Ew!
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, these kids, they came out of nowhere, they pinned my arm back, they grabbed my wallet, and they knocked me to the ground."
Ron Swanson,How did you counterattack?
Ron Swanson,Fist to the throat?
Ron Swanson,Did you hit him in the beanbag?
Ron Swanson,There's no shame in attacking a criminal's beanbag.
Jerry Gergich,"No, I just curled up and laid still until they left."
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's another way to play it."
Leslie Knope,Did any of them have weird tattoos or scars or anything?
Leslie Knope,"If even one of them had a unique scar, we got them."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't get a good look.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,You're the victim.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I feel like we're responsible for this.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,We didn't mug Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Well, why was he in the park in the first place?"
Tom Haverford,Because we tricked him into going there.
Tom Haverford,I don't see the connection.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,This is on us.
Leslie Knope,It's karma.
Tom Haverford,Wouldn't it be karma if we were the ones that got mugged?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,That's how pathetic Jerry is.
April Ludgate,He can't even get karma right.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's not funny."
Leslie Knope,Our friend got mugged this morning.
Leslie Knope,And we will not let that happen in vain.
Tom Haverford,He doesn't have a black eye.
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, the whole department has a black eye."
Leslie Knope,"This is our wakeup call, guys."
Leslie Knope,Jerry's face is the symbol of failure.
Leslie Knope,Our failure to keep the parks safe.
Leslie Knope,I have some folders.
Leslie Knope,Inside are some assignments.
Leslie Knope,And some homemade taffy.
All,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"April, I want you to check in with our police liaison."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, I need you to go to Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're with me."
April Ludgate,"So, when you say that you want me to check in with the police liaison, you mean hook up with him, right?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Just check in with him.
Leslie Knope,Everybody dismissed.
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Ron Swanson,I want to help.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to teach everybody self-defense, so you can defend yourselves."
Leslie Knope,We need it.
Leslie Knope,Because we certainly are a bunch of weaklings.
Leslie Knope,Especially Tom.
Tom Haverford,I am not a weakling.
April Ludgate,Arm wrestle me right now.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I think I'm more than holding my own here.
Andy Dwyer,"Three, four, five…"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Six.
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,How you doing?
Ann Perkins,Not too bad.
Ann Perkins,I was just dropping off Jerry from the hospital.
Ann Perkins,He was mugged in the park.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry?
Andy Dwyer,The black guy with the Looney Tunes ties?
Andy Dwyer,I love him.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Jerry who works with Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,That Jerry?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,He got mugged?
Andy Dwyer,Oh. Oh wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, that's kind of a bummer, too."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, while I have you here, what do you think of this?"
Andy Dwyer,Scrotation Marks.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know what you're talking about, but my gut says no."
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,"Because ""Mouse Rat,"" it's a great name, but at the same time, it sucks."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I think we have to change it just one more time."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, you've got to stop doing that."
Ann Perkins,How are people going to become fans if they literally don't know the name of the band they're listening to?
Andy Dwyer,That is a really good point.
Ann Perkins,I always had fun with Andy.
Ann Perkins,"The problem is, when you're his girlfriend, you're also his mother, and his maid and his nurse."
Ann Perkins,He's completely helpless.
Ann Perkins,He's like a baby in a straightjacket.
Ann Perkins,Ooh!
Ann Perkins,"""Baby in a Straightjacket."""
Ann Perkins,That's a good band name.
Ann Perkins,I should tell him that.
Leslie Knope,"Haha, guys."
Leslie Knope,Really funny.
Leslie Knope,Where's the real banner?
April Ludgate,We only had an hour.
Leslie Knope,So did I.
Leslie Knope,Look what I did.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,Welcome back.
Jerry Gergich,Really.
Jerry Gergich,"My gosh, you should not have gone to all this trouble."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It's no trouble for our buddy.
Leslie Knope,Here you go.
Leslie Knope,Listen.
Leslie Knope,Today is Jerry Day.
Leslie Knope,We'll do whatever you want to do.
Leslie Knope,Anything at all.
Jerry Gergich,"Honestly, what I would like to do is just have everything go back to normal."
Ron Swanson,That sounds good to me.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I believe you were going to do a presentation.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, sir, I was."
Jerry Gergich,I will go set up.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, you guys."
Leslie Knope,No jokes.
Leslie Knope,No comments.
Leslie Knope,Nothing but support.
Tom Haverford,He needs a lot of support.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Tom Haverford,Talking about a bra for a man.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, seriously."
Leslie Knope,That was the last one.
Jerry Gergich,"So, as we know, Spring Hunting Season is upon us."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, anyway, here's the info about the new licensing system."
Leslie Knope,Um Jerry?
Leslie Knope,I don't... I don't think your computer is plugged in.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, guys."
Jerry Gergich,Just got to power up.
Jerry Gergich,First thing we should have is my graph about the season.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,Wait a minute.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,That is not the graph.
Jerry Gergich,That's a picture from my vacation to Muncie.
Tom Haverford,"You went on a vacation and you chose Muncie, Indiana?"
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,My wife and I have a timeshare.
Tom Haverford,In Muncie?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, Muncie is a lovely city."
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, Hunting and Fishing Season is winding down."
Jerry Gergich,Okay?
Jerry Gergich,"And we all know that it's already closed season on ""twout."""
Jerry Gergich,"So, now I said ""twout"" instead of ""trout."""
Donna Meagle,It happens to everyone.
Jerry Gergich,My marbles are full of mouth today.
Jerry Gergich,You know what?
Jerry Gergich,Has anybody seen my glasses?
Jerry Gergich,I don't even think I can…
Tom Haverford,"It says here ""1:00 meeting."""
Tom Haverford,And who are we meeting with?
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,"Please, no."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, it's important to meet with the Park Rangers."
Leslie Knope,They are the first line of defense.
Carl Lorthner,Leslie Knope!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Carl."
Carl Lorthner,"What's up, pencil pushers?"
Carl Lorthner,Haverford.
Carl Lorthner,"Good to see you, man."
Carl Lorthner,Is it hot in here?
Carl Lorthner,I feel hot.
Carl Lorthner,Are you guys hot?
Carl Lorthner,How you guys doing?
Carl Lorthner,I'm good.
Carl Lorthner,You guys got any snacks?
Tom Haverford,Carl is the head of all outdoor security.
Tom Haverford,"Why was he transferred from his indoor desk job, you ask."
Tom Haverford,Listen.
Carl Lorthner,"Hey, Leslie."
Carl Lorthner,Have you seen Avatar?
Carl Lorthner,I never saw Avatar.
Carl Lorthner,"I wanted to read the book first, but then I realized there's no book version of Avatar."
Carl Lorthner,What did you guys do for St. Patty's Day?
Carl Lorthner,"I was wearing this tshirt that said ""Kiss me, I'm Irish."""
Carl Lorthner,But no one would kiss me.
Carl Lorthner,So.
Carl Lorthner,You're too important for me until one of your own gets attacked.
Leslie Knope,I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the parks safe.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, you think you know how to do my job?"
Carl Lorthner,"Well, you might not be so confident once you've walked a mile in my size sevens."
Leslie Knope,Kind of small feet.
Tom Haverford,"Actually, seven is the worldwide average."
Carl Lorthner,Boom!
Ron Swanson,Welcome to the emergency self-defense class.
Ron Swanson,"I'll be showing you how to escape from a variety of situations, while inflicting maximum damage on your attackers."
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, do you think that maybe I should put Mark in a headlock?"
Andy Dwyer,"That way, I can show everyone how to escape a pervert?"
Mark Brendanawicz,"In the scenario you just laid out, you're the pervert."
Mark Brendanawicz,"You understand that, right?"
Andy Dwyer,You wish.
Ron Swanson,Enough.
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to start off simple, and demonstrate how to extract oneself from a wrist grab."
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,Ann.
Ron Swanson,Step up here.
Ann Perkins,I watch a lot of Lifetime movies.
Ann Perkins,"There was this one, How Far is Too Far Enough: The Teri Palliber Lonergan Story."
Ann Perkins,"This woman had agoraphobia and her therapist was obsessed with her, and he hid in her house."
Ann Perkins,And then he attacked her and tried to eat her toes.
Ann Perkins,"Also, her daughter was having sex way too young."
Ann Perkins,"So, yeah."
Ann Perkins,Free self-defense class?
Ann Perkins,I'm there.
Ron Swanson,And then just twist away.
Ron Swanson,Very good.
Ron Swanson,Very good.
Ron Swanson,Well done.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,"What's up now, mugger?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, that was awesome."
Andy Dwyer,That was really good.
Jerry Gergich,"I don't know, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,I'd rather be back at the office.
Leslie Knope,"I know this is painful for you, Jerry, but you have to be strong."
Carl Lorthner,You guys ready?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,We're ready.
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you guys all the problems we've been facing.
Carl Lorthner,I'm going to show you that we've been doing everything we can.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm looking forward to working together, Carl."
Carl Lorthner,"And after that, I'm going to show you this log I found."
Carl Lorthner,"It's got, like, fifty worms on it."
Carl Lorthner,"I call it ""worm log."""
Carl Lorthner,"Yeah, I've always been a bit of an outdoorsman."
Carl Lorthner,"When I was a kid, my parents used to make me hang out in the backyard a lot and just run around until I got tired."
Carl Lorthner,"But if there's any criminals out there watching, I never get tired."
Carl Lorthner,"And ladies, too."
Tom Haverford,This thing is a mess.
Carl Lorthner,"We used to have three carts, actually."
Carl Lorthner,The first one got pushed into the creek by some kids.
Carl Lorthner,"The second one, raccoons got onto."
Carl Lorthner,There was urine everywhere.
Carl Lorthner,And the third one was recently stolen.
Tom Haverford,What's this one?
Carl Lorthner,This is the second one.
Carl Lorthner,The raccoon piss one.
Carl Lorthner,All right.
Carl Lorthner,So we're going to just head out.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, no."
Carl Lorthner,You know what?
Carl Lorthner,I think we've got too much weight.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"That's Tom, probably."
Tom Haverford,Are you serious?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, can you get off, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Just run alongside the cart, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Carl Lorthner,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Carl Lorthner,"So, I want to tell you a little bit about the park."
Carl Lorthner,Up here on the left is one of our most beautiful grass fields.
Carl Lorthner,It's primarily grass.
Carl Lorthner,"All right, I'm going to make a hard left here."
Carl Lorthner,"Stick with us, Tom."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Lesson learned.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Next.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,Impressive.
Ron Swanson,"I'm going to engage Andy in an attack hold, and he's going to try and break free."
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I don't want to hurt you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Don't worry about that.
Ron Swanson,Just try to escape my attack.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, when I get out, am I allowed to counterstrike?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,"When you get out, you may counterattack."
Andy Dwyer,"But just promise me you'll be ready, because, I mean, I don't want to destroy you."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I see where we're going with this.
Ron Swanson,"Now, when your arms are pinned to your sides, use your legs to break free, instead of your neck, which is what Andy is trying to do."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, hold up."
Andy Dwyer,Get off!
April Ludgate,Let him go.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ron Swanson,Oops.
Carl Lorthner,Any of this looking familiar?
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,It happened right over there.
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, yeah."
Carl Lorthner,I'm not surprised.
Carl Lorthner,Take a look at this path.
Carl Lorthner,"With budget cuts, we can't afford a single safety light."
Carl Lorthner,There's been 10 assaults already this year.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Can't you station a Park Ranger out here?
Carl Lorthner,We have!
Carl Lorthner,Who do you think they're assaulting?
Carl Lorthner,I'm sorry.
Carl Lorthner,I didn't mean to yell.
Leslie Knope,"One way or another, I'm going to get money so you can protect Jerry, and all the other helpless, pathetic people in this town."
Tom Haverford,You guys have got to slow down.
Tom Haverford,Can I just take a rest for a minute?
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,No can do.
Leslie Knope,Sun's going down and it's real dangerous out here.
Leslie Knope,"Let's roll, Carl."
Carl Lorthner,Okay.
Carl Lorthner,Going fast.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, what day is it today?"
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
April Ludgate,"Okay, but to be fair, you never know."
Andy Dwyer,That's kind of true.
Andy Dwyer,I'm super bad at days.
Andy Dwyer,"But honestly, I'm fine."
Ron Swanson,"Sorry I squeezed your lights out there, son."
Andy Dwyer,No worries.
Andy Dwyer,"Will you show me how to do that move, though?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,I can teach you right now--
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"Andy, you should really just take it easy, I think."
Ann Perkins,Do you want some more water?
Ann Perkins,Or maybe some pancakes?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,What is the first move in any fight?
Andy Dwyer,Punch to the balls.
Joan Callamezzo,We've all heard the old saying.
Joan Callamezzo,"""Parks are supposed to be fun."""
Joan Callamezzo,"But sometimes, muggers have their own ideas."
Joan Callamezzo,Leslie Knope is with us again from the Parks Department.
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, tell us your story."
Leslie Knope,"This is my coworker, Jerry Gergich."
Leslie Knope,Diabetic.
Leslie Knope,Sloppily out of shape.
Leslie Knope,Friend.
Leslie Knope,He was mugged this morning in Ramsett Park.
Leslie Knope,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,Your frumpy uncle?
Leslie Knope,Your simple neighbor?
Leslie Knope,Your unpopular coworker?
Leslie Knope,"Head of security, Carl Lorthner, is doing his best to keep the parks safe, but he's failing."
Joan Callamezzo,"So, what is the solution to fix this?"
Joan Callamezzo,To make it right.
Joan Callamezzo,And not bad.
Leslie Knope,We need money from City Hall.
Leslie Knope,And it's not coming through.
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee, I am sorry to say this, but your government is failing you."
Joan Callamezzo,"Up next, 10 objects you didn't know you can eat."
Paul,What possessed you to do that?
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys got mugged in the park."
Paul,I don't care how upset you are.
Paul,You do not badmouth your own government on TV.
Paul,I'm sure you'll be happy to know your little stunt worked.
Paul,The Mayor is going to divert 2500 dollars to the Parks for security upgrades.
Paul,There's going to be an announcement tomorrow at 10:00 in the press room.
Paul,So... Make sure you bring the doofus who got his ass kicked.
Leslie Knope,I don't know who you're referring to.
Leslie Knope,We treat everyone with respect around here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Paul,Good morning.
Paul,"As many of you know, there was an incident involving a government employee in Ramsett Park."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, are you nervous?"
Leslie Knope,Just talk about how hard it was for you.
Leslie Knope,Speak from the heart.
Leslie Knope,You'll be fine.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't mugged.
Paul,...safety of our citizens.
Paul,That's why we're here today to give Pawnee…
Paul,Jerry?
Paul,Why don't you step on up here?
Leslie Knope,"No, I will."
Leslie Knope,Get up here.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to speak for Jerry.
Leslie Knope,He can't talk right now because he has hysterical muteness from trauma.
Jerry Gergich,Correct.
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,What about this?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Is this fake?
Jerry Gergich,This is real.
Jerry Gergich,I really dislocated my shoulder.
Leslie Knope,Were you even in the park yesterday?
Jerry Gergich," Look, I was on my way to feed the hummingbirds, and I stopped for a breakfast burrito."
Leslie Knope, The farting.
Jerry Gergich, Yeah.
Jerry Gergich," And Lord Sheldon, he lunged at a bird, I dropped the burrito, and it landed on a log in the creek."
Jerry Gergich," So, I go to reach for it, I lose my balance, and I fall on my shoulder really weird."
Leslie Knope," Well, why didn't you just tell everybody the truth?"
Jerry Gergich,Are you kidding me? Imagine what Tom would have said.
Leslie Knope," Damn, Jerry! You jumped in a creek for a burrito? What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Kill your wife?"
Andy Dwyer,Block the opponent's punch and counter-punch to the jaw.
Andy Dwyer, Shoeshine?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Andy Dwyer," Oh! Hey! Ann Perkins, in the ""shoe-shouse."""
Ann Perkins,I wanted to check in.
Ann Perkins, I brought some stuff from the hospital.
Ann Perkins," Water, a compress, aspirin, some lollipops, I know you love those."
Andy Dwyer," Ann, you know, thank you."
Andy Dwyer," But really, I'm feeling great."
Andy Dwyer, I took a couple of aspirin and slept right through the night.
Andy Dwyer, And-- Hold on a second.
Andy Dwyer, Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer, What the hell? I got you one of those veggie muffins that you're always eating.
April Ludgate, Score.
Andy Dwyer, Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, It tastes like a rug.
April Ludgate, Shut up.
Andy Dwyer, Don't hit me.
Ann Perkins, Good.
Ann Perkins," Well, I'm glad you're feeling better."
Andy Dwyer, I am.
Andy Dwyer, Thank you for that.
Andy Dwyer, That's so cool.
Ann Perkins," Since when did he start doing stuff for other people? Now, I actually am worried that something happened to his brain."
Ann Perkins," People change, I guess."
Mark Brendanawicz,Wouldn't you rather the money go to keeping the parks safe?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but now, we have the money under false pretenses."
Mark Brendanawicz, I actually think that you have a bigger problem than the money.
Leslie Knope, What?
Mark Brendanawicz,"There is someone in your department who is willing to lie about being mugged, because he's afraid of his co-workers."
Leslie Knope, Knope.
Leslie Knope, Yep.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, Carl.
Leslie Knope, What are you doing?
Carl Lorthner,"Oh, Leslie."
Carl Lorthner," Well, since you decided to drag my name through the mud on TV, I figured why not return the favor."
Leslie Knope," Carl, could you quietly quiet down for a second, and please tell me what is going on, quietly? Okay? In a quiet voice."
Carl Lorthner, A citizen handed in a very interesting home video that I think the people of Pawnee will find very interesting.
Carl Lorthner, Take a peek at this.
Carl Lorthner, Keep your eyes on the creek.
Carl Lorthner, There he is.
Carl Lorthner, This is my favorite part.
Carl Lorthner, Not willing to share with a dog.
Carl Lorthner," So, it would appear that Park Security was not to blame after all."
Leslie Knope," Okay, look."
Leslie Knope, I have a proposition for you.
Carl Lorthner, Fine.
Carl Lorthner, I'll have sex with you in exchange for the tape.
Leslie Knope, That's not what I am saying.
Leslie Knope, Okay? Just listen to what I have to say.
Joan Callamezzo, The Ramsett Park mugging story continues with a shiny new twist.
Joan Callamezzo, Ranger Carl Lorthner is here today.
Joan Callamezzo," Now, I understand that you have a bombshell to drop that you are just sitting on."
Carl Lorthner," Yes, that's correct."
Carl Lorthner, I came on today because I have some very important information to share.
Carl Lorthner, I finally saw Avatar and I thought it lived up to the hype.
Joan Callamezzo," Well, I'm not sure what that has to do with the mugging."
Joan Callamezzo, Uh... Leslie.
Joan Callamezzo, Counterpoint.
Leslie Knope, I disagree with Carl.
Joan Callamezzo, Okay.
Leslie Knope," I have seen Avatar as well, and I think it exceeded the hype."
Carl Lorthner, What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, we…"
Carl Lorthner, Disagreement.
Joan Callamezzo," Well, things are really heating up in here, aren't they? We should probably take some calls."
Joan Callamezzo, That segment was a disaster.
Joan Callamezzo, Don't you ever [bleep] me like that again.
Joan Callamezzo, This is Pawnee [bleep] Today.
Joan Callamezzo," Do you know that I bumped a cat that can stand up on its hinders for you? You disgust me, Knope."
Joan Callamezzo, Get out of my sight.
Leslie Knope," Yes, ma'am."
Joan Callamezzo, Go.
Joan Callamezzo, Go on.
Joan Callamezzo," Oh, no, no, no."
Joan Callamezzo, Don't make me chase you.
Joan Callamezzo, You want to go eat something?
Carl Lorthner,Okay.
Leslie Knope, I am part of a great team.
Leslie Knope," And sometimes, the best way to maintain a strong team is just by letting someone know that he is still a part of it."
Leslie Knope," This is the only copy, and I am going to destroy it."
Leslie Knope, Right after I watch it one more time.
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry, but it is so good."
April Ludgate," Hey, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich, Hmm.
April Ludgate, I got you a peppermint latte.
Jerry Gergich, Seriously? My goodness.
Jerry Gergich, I love a peppermint--
April Ludgate,I know.
Jerry Gergich," Oh, geez."
Jerry Gergich, Go ahead.
April Ludgate, We should just directly apply the food to your clothes.
Leslie Knope, Making fun of Jerry is back!
Jerry Gergich,They can laugh at me all they want.
Jerry Gergich, Because two more years until I retire with full benefits and pension.
Jerry Gergich," And the wife and I, we have bought a little cottage on a lake."
Jerry Gergich," And I am going to get myself a stack of mystery novels, a box of cigars, and I am going to sit back and enjoy my life."
Tom Haverford," Hey, Jerry? April was just double-checking the lunch order."
Tom Haverford," Do you want the salmon or the ""twout""?"
April Ludgate,Twout! Twout! Twout! Twout!   
Tom Haverford,Twout! Twout! Twout! Twout!

Ron Swanson,Good morning.
Tom Haverford,Whoo!
Tom Haverford,Swiss Family Ronbinson!
Tom Haverford,That hat is dope.
Ron Swanson,"Thanks, Tom."
Tom Haverford,You mind if I rock that bad Larry on my dome?
Tom Haverford,Wear it on my head?
Tom Haverford,Try it on the ladies?
Ron Swanson,Be my guest.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Tom."
Tom Haverford,I have a raccoon on my head.
Tom Haverford,Excuse me?
Tom Haverford,My friend over here was digging through your trash and I think we may have a lot in common.
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom.
Tom Haverford,Would you like to see a movie sometime?
Tom Haverford,Are you a raccoon?
Tom Haverford,Because you've been running around my hat all day-- Head all day.
Tom Haverford,"Girl, you're more precious than Precious."
Donna Meagle,Uh-uh.
Tom Haverford,"""Nice hat. Wanna bone?"""
Tom Haverford,"That's you, talking to me."
Donna Meagle,No.
Donna Meagle,"How about, ""Yes, I am a hunter, and it's you season."""
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, that's great."
Tom Haverford,I gotta get back out there.
Tom Haverford,"You know what they say, animal on the head, manimal in the bed."
Tom Haverford,"Damn, girl!"
Tom Haverford,Your hotness killed my raccoon!
Tom Haverford,I have a raccoon hat.
Tom Haverford,I'm an interesting person.
Tom Haverford,Hello!
Ron Swanson,Any luck?
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,Didn't work out as well as I thought it would.
Ron Swanson,"Well, better luck next time."
Tom Haverford,I tried.
Tom Haverford,It just didn't seem like--
Extra,Wow.
Extra,I love that hat.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise for you.
Leslie Knope,Meet me at Harvey James Park at 11:30.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,It's a surprise!
Leslie Knope,What's the surprise?
Leslie Knope,"If I told you, it would ruin the surprise."
Ron Swanson,What's the surprise it would ruin?
Leslie Knope,I cannot tell you that.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, my first wife, Tammy, tried throwing me a surprise birthday party."
Ron Swanson,"When I saw my friends hiding through the window, I drove to a gas station, called the cops and told them people had broken into my home."
Ron Swanson,I'm not big on surprises.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're gonna like this one."
Ron Swanson,What is it?
Leslie Knope,I'm not telling you.
Leslie Knope,And I'm not gonna tell anybody!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you.
Leslie Knope,We're putting together the Parks Department Summer Catalog.
Leslie Knope,"And the big surprise is I am going to reunite all the living former Parks Directors at a picnic, record the whole thing, and then write about it in the ""Welcome Letter."""
Leslie Knope,It's the biggest catalog of the year.
Leslie Knope,Think of the September issue of Vogue.
Leslie Knope,But it's more important to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna move this ""Yearning"" ad to the centerfold."
Tom Haverford,"Centerfold, always the best part."
Tom Haverford,"Am I right, Justin?"
Tom Haverford,"Damn, they broke up six weeks ago."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need to see your softball pictures."
Jerry Gergich,"Here you go, Chief."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, good job."
Leslie Knope,Nice work.
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate,Isn't that that creepy guy?
April Ludgate,Morgan?
April Ludgate,The pedophile?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it is."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,Come on!
Jerry Gergich,I didn't know that!
Jerry Gergich,He seemed okay.
Jerry Gergich,We had dinner together.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I don't know if I made it clear, but I don't want any sex offenders in our Parks catalog."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, I will Photoshop his face."
April Ludgate,"Can you Photoshop your life with better decisions, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, April."
Leslie Knope,Enough.
Leslie Knope,Cover photo.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're up."
Tom Haverford,"This catalog is basically, like, an ad for the Parks Department, and I love ads."
Tom Haverford,"I love magazine ads for flavored vodkas, billboards for designer jeans."
Tom Haverford,I TiVo through shows to get to the ads.
Tom Haverford,I love ads.
Tom Haverford,What are we trying to do with this catalog?
Tom Haverford,We're trying to sell Pawnee on our summer classes.
Tom Haverford,How do we do that?
Tom Haverford,"With one perfect, captivating image."
Tom Haverford,April?
Tom Haverford,Modern life.
Tom Haverford,Where are we running?
Tom Haverford,"Sometimes, what we want is not always where we are."
Tom Haverford,Next slide.
Tom Haverford,Are we alone?
Tom Haverford,Is the real winter inside our hearts?
Tom Haverford,We are all struggling for definition in a world that resists our inquiries.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons."
Leslie Knope,"One, this is a summer catalog."
Leslie Knope,"Two, that was complete gibberish."
Leslie Knope,"And three, that child looks like it's abandoned."
Leslie Knope,"So, basically, boo."
Tom Haverford,Next slide.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Weird.
Tom Haverford,How did that... That's a personal photo.
Tom Haverford,"That's... Shouldn't be.. This must've... You know, I gotta say, I think that could actually work as our cover photo."
Tom Haverford,"I'm cool with it, if you guys are."
Tom Haverford,It's a high-res photo.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know if I have time for this, guys, so, let's just pick a good photo, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Tom Haverford,A picture of parents pushing a kid on a swing?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,Get me that.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I gotta go.
Tom Haverford,What is he thinking?
April Ludgate,"""Why is my cup so tiny?"""
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
Mark Brendanawicz,Happy six month anniversary.
Mark Brendanawicz,I got you a gift.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's a chicken salad sandwich.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And I don't want you to feel bad about not getting me anything, because I would never expect--"
Ann Perkins,"Swiss Army Watch, mofo."
Mark Brendanawicz,Well done.
Mark Brendanawicz,Perkins.
Mark Brendanawicz,Wow!
Ann Perkins,You like it?
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you so much.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's so nice.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you allowed to kiss me in a hospital room?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, don't worry about it."
Ann Perkins,He's dead.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, I'm just kidding, he's sleeping."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, okay."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Yeah, our relationship is going well."
Mark Brendanawicz,Really well.
Mark Brendanawicz,That guy really seemed dead.
Andy Dwyer,Nice!
April Ludgate,"Here, catch this."
Andy Dwyer,You got me in the face!
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,That one hurt.
Andy Dwyer,You've a good arm.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,I used to play softball in high school.
Andy Dwyer,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,I played baseball in high school.
April Ludgate,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that's like, the boy version of softball."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, don't play with the food, okay?"
Leslie Knope,We need this for the picnic.
Leslie Knope,Do we have everything?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, ma'am."
Andy Dwyer,"Three picnic baskets, assorted cheeses, grapes, wine."
Leslie Knope,Smoked salmon?
Andy Dwyer,April threw the smoked salmon on the roof.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,Where's Leslie?
Ann Perkins,She just texted me from your phone and said she left her phone at home and that I should come here immediately.
Ann Perkins,And why did I believe that?
Tom Haverford,"Maybe in your heart you knew it was from me, but you came anyway."
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Tom, would you please stop texting me that you're having a city planning emergency?"
Mark Brendanawicz,There's no such thing as a city planning emergency.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Hi, there."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Tom Haverford,Look at you two.
Tom Haverford,"Ann Perkins, Mark Brendanawicz."
Tom Haverford,"""Anndanawicz."""
Tom Haverford,"Or ""Merkins."""
Tom Haverford,"No, ""Anndanawicz."""
Tom Haverford,You two should be models.
Tom Haverford,Maybe on the cover of the Parks Department Summer Catalog?
Ann Perkins,"That's not the reason you called me in here, right?"
Ann Perkins,Cause I just finished a 12 hour shift.
Ann Perkins,If that's the reason--
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ann."
Tom Haverford,It'd be a huge favor for Leslie.
Tom Haverford,You know how important this is to her.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, I am in."
Ann Perkins,Dude!
Mark Brendanawicz,I am.
Mark Brendanawicz,We don't have any pictures of just the two of us.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Plus, I've always said we should go on more dates with Tom."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you have."
Ann Perkins,And thank God an opportunity presented itself.
Mark Brendanawicz,See?
Mark Brendanawicz,Win win.
Tom Haverford,"Now, Ann, you're gonna change, right?"
Ann Perkins,I guess.
Tom Haverford,Would it kill you to maybe put on some lipstick?
Tom Haverford,Do you even own lipstick?
Leslie Knope,This is probably the first time in history these four great men have been in the same place at the same time.
Leslie Knope,It kind of makes you-- What is this?
Andy Dwyer,Sweater swap!
Andy Dwyer,She noticed!
Andy Dwyer,You were right.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Somebody's here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, just act normal."
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,Just be like normal people.
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Leslie Knope,Hi!
Leslie Knope,David Moser!
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,It is such an honor to meet you.
David Moser,Right.
David Moser,How long is this gonna take?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, not very long."
Leslie Knope,"I realize, of course, you're a very busy man."
Leslie Knope,I love parks.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if that's something I've communicated before.
Leslie Knope,"So, having a picnic with all the former living Parks Department Directors-- Guess who just checked something off her bucket list?"
Leslie Knope,"Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson, gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park."
Leslie Knope,I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.
David Moser,"I thought you were dead, Clarence."
Clarence Carrington,No.
Clarence Carrington,"I'm gonna outlive you, then I'm gonna nail your wife."
David Moser,"Screw you, you old coot."
Michael Tansley,Classic David.
Michael Tansley,You're worse than Ron.
Ron Swanson,"Shut your damn mouth, Tansley."
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,"When I say ""parks,"" you say ""department!"""
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Leslie Knope,Parks!
Andy Dwyer,Apartment!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would.
Leslie Knope,Can you guys run up ahead and set up the picnic?
Andy Dwyer,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,Where are they going with the food?
Ron Swanson,I'm starving.
Ron Swanson,I only had one breakfast.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Look, what was going on back there?"
Leslie Knope,Why all the sniping?
Ron Swanson,Not exactly sure.
Ron Swanson,"The only one I know is Michael, and we're not exactly best friends."
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,I'm hungry.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, don't be such a baby."
Leslie Knope,I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.
Ron Swanson,I ate it already.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car.
Ron Swanson,And now it's gone.
Ron Swanson,And I hate everything.
Tom Haverford,"Good, good, good."
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I think we got the boring cliche shot that Leslie wanted.
Mark Brendanawicz,That's it?
Mark Brendanawicz,We're done?
Tom Haverford,Not even close.
Tom Haverford,Now the real art begins.
Tom Haverford,"Step one, nail this photo shoot with an amazing, iconic image."
Tom Haverford,"Step two, book some outside gigs."
Tom Haverford,"Step three, have sex with a model."
Tom Haverford,"Step four, step in front of the camera, become a model."
Tom Haverford,"Go, yes!"
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Tom Haverford,"Ann, can you give me something, anything, in the face?"
Ann Perkins,What do you want me to do?
Tom Haverford,Do what Mark's doing.
Tom Haverford,He's doing great!
Tom Haverford,Keep slithering!
Mark Brendanawicz,"I'm not doing anything, so…"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog."
Clarence Carrington,I remember.
Clarence Carrington,That first year we offered four classes.
Clarence Carrington,I actually taught Homemaking.
Clarence Carrington,Women were not allowed to teach back then.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I thought there were female teachers way before then.
Clarence Carrington,Not in my department.
Leslie Knope,"Well, times have changed."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department."
Clarence Carrington,"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea."
Clarence Carrington,"Women need a lot of blood to flow through to their baby centers, which leaves less to the brain, you see."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Clarence Carrington,"I'd stay away from leadership roles, for your own safety."
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,No!
Andy Dwyer,Maybe I should write a song about a picnic.
April Ludgate,"Ooh, where'd you come up with that idea?"
Andy Dwyer,The picnic we're having.
Andy Dwyer,"I already have the perfect title, Life is a Picnic."
April Ludgate,That's good.
April Ludgate,How about Life is a Picnic with You?
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Then it could be about a girl.
Andy Dwyer,Or Peyton Manning!
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.
Andy Dwyer,You wanna help me write the lyrics?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, totally."
Andy Dwyer,We should grab a drink after this at Tucker's.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I would do that."
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.
April Ludgate,I just have to get my stuff from the office.
April Ludgate,But that's-- That'd be cool.
Leslie Knope,"David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?"
David Moser,"Well, I was in Public Works for eight years."
David Moser,But the director was pretty young.
David Moser,Clarence was old and weak.
David Moser,"So, I put in for a transfer, swooped in and pushed him out."
Leslie Knope,There was no other reason you wanted the job?
David Moser,No.
David Moser,Just the money and the pension.
David Moser,The actual job's a nightmare.
David Moser,"I mean, who gives a crap about this crap."
Leslie Knope,"Well, David, I think we've talked enough."
Tom Haverford,"Mark, that's great."
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, great."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, you look miserable!"
Tom Haverford,Terrible.
Tom Haverford,Terrible!
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Ann."
Tom Haverford,What are we doing?
Tom Haverford,Maxim or Good Housekeeping?
Ann Perkins,I'm not sure which one is the insult.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, if there's anyone out there that's doing a photo shoot about the dangers of eating undercooked chicken, I can give you Ann's phone number."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's stop for a second."
Tom Haverford,"Bobby, I love how you work."
Bobby,Yay!
Tom Haverford,You can have as many juice boxes as you want.
Tom Haverford,"In fact, grab me one, too."
Tom Haverford,Make it an apple.
Tom Haverford,"Mark, great job, you can have a juice box, too."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, take a walk with me."
Tom Haverford,"In a million years, I never thought you would be the problem with this photo shoot."
Ann Perkins,"Didn't you just plan this, like, two hours ago?"
Tom Haverford,I just don't get it.
Tom Haverford,How could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot?
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry I'm not a professional model.
Ann Perkins,"And screaming, ""Make your face better!"" doesn't help."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm sorry, your face just isn't working."
Tom Haverford,And we need to do something to distract from this boring area.
Tom Haverford,"Now, I didn't want to have to do this, but we may have to go nude."
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Tom!"
Tom Haverford,Fair enough.
Tom Haverford,I totally understand.
Tom Haverford,But we should get one for safety.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,We're almost there.
Leslie Knope,It's right up here.
Clarence Carrington,You really shouldn't be leading us.
Clarence Carrington,"If you're menstruating, you'll attract bears."
Leslie Knope,Holy God.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here we are.
Ron Swanson,Eat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it hasn't gone exactly as I've hoped."
Leslie Knope,But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna-- It's gonna be good.
David Moser,Hey.
David Moser,I just whizzed on a butterfly!
Leslie Knope,"Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog."
David Moser,You should just copy the Eagleton one.
David Moser,I used to just copy the Eagleton one.
Leslie Knope,Did you?
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.
Michael Tansley,"Well, I think you've done a wonderful job maintaining the parks."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Michael."
Leslie Knope,I appreciate that.
Leslie Knope,Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?
Michael Tansley,"Oh, in a way."
Michael Tansley,"Pencil pushing wasn't really my thing, but I did love the parks themselves."
Michael Tansley,That was the best part of the job.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,I totally agree.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank goodness for you."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, thank goodness for Michael."
Ron Swanson,"Are you still on parole, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ha, ha."
Leslie Knope,"Very funny, Ron."
Michael Tansley,Yes.
Michael Tansley,"Yes, Ron, I am."
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,He smoked pot.
Ron Swanson,In the office.
Ron Swanson,And in all the parks.
Ron Swanson,Constantly.
Michael Tansley,"In fairness to me, it was a different time."
Michael Tansley,It was the early '90s.
Michael Tansley,"But also, it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal."
Michael Tansley,Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.
Michael Tansley,"Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?"
Michael Tansley,"That makes sense to you, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, I can't hear hippies."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if you had to sleep with one of the old guys, who would it be?"
April Ludgate,The super old one.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Mmmhmm.
April Ludgate,I'm an eyebrow girl.
April Ludgate,I wanna make out with him and chew his eyebrows off.
Andy Dwyer,That is really gross.
Clarence Carrington,Anybody got any water?
David Moser,I want water.
David Moser,"I'm so old, I need to drink water."
Michael Tansley,"Oh, stop it, stop taunting him."
Clarence Carrington,"I don't need your help, jailbird."
Ron Swanson,"If there's any unclaimed meat or cheese, I would like to claim it."
Michael Tansley,Yeah.
Michael Tansley,Like you claimed my job?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Exactly like that, in that I wanted it, and then I took it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, you know what I would love?"
Leslie Knope,"I would love if anybody just said something positive about, oh, I don't know, anything."
Michael Tansley,I agree.
Michael Tansley,"Let's just relax, smoke another J, and all calm down."
Leslie Knope,Another?
Michael Tansley,"By the way, it's ridiculous that pot is illegal."
Michael Tansley,It grows in the ground!
Michael Tansley,"I've planted marijuana in community gardens all over the city, and it hasn't hurt anyone!"
Leslie Knope,What?
David Moser,"You know, Michael?"
David Moser,You are one pot loving mother [bleep] pain in the rectum.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,"You're all being awful, horrible men!"
Clarence Carrington, Uh-oh.
Clarence Carrington, Your little friend come to visit?
Leslie Knope,"Clarence, if you mention anything about women, or menstruation, or anything, I'm gonna take your face and I'm gonna shove it in those brambles."
David Moser, Yes!
Leslie Knope,"No! You're next, buddy."
Leslie Knope, Andy! Let's take this picture.
Leslie Knope," Come on! Get out of your seats, turds."
David Moser, What?
Leslie Knope,Line up over there.
Leslie Knope, Come on.
Leslie Knope, Just please try to look human.
Leslie Knope," All right, and not so evil."
Leslie Knope, Everybody looking here.
Leslie Knope," One, two, three."
Leslie Knope, Thank you so much for the wonderful memories.
Leslie Knope, Everybody take their stuff and go.
Andy Dwyer," Ooh, ooh, ooh."
Andy Dwyer, Can we do one funny face one?
Leslie Knope,Do you have that picture that Andy took? Maybe I'll run it without any text.
April Ludgate, Yeah.
April Ludgate, I tried to Photoshop it to make it look like they were happy.
April Ludgate, It was really hard.
April Ludgate, Their mouths are so old.
Leslie Knope, God! Look at these horrible men.
Leslie Knope," You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog."
April Ludgate, Would you like these men in your catalog?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, April."
Leslie Knope, That's disgusting.
April Ludgate, What? Look how generous they're being with each other.
Tom Haverford," And here's the ""Obstruction"" series."
Tom Haverford," What do you think? Amazing, right? I call this one ""The Future."""
Ann Perkins,It's completely blurry.
Tom Haverford," Yes, it is, Ann."
Ann Perkins, What about the ones we took on the swing? The normal ones?
Tom Haverford,"You mean the ""Unhappy Wife"" photos?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins," These are even worse, somehow."
Ann Perkins, I look miserable.
Mark Brendanawicz, You do look kind of miserable.
Tom Haverford," Now you know what I meant by, ""Make your face better."""
Mark Brendanawicz,"Was there something wrong, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, I had just gotten off a long shift."
Ann Perkins, He was being really annoying.
Tom Haverford, Mark looks happy.
Ann Perkins," Just please don't use these, okay? Let's grab some dinner."
Mark Brendanawicz, Sure.
Leslie Knope," Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope, You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter? Nothing.
Leslie Knope, Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with.
Ron Swanson, Did you print this out? I heard the printer going.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Ron Swanson, You could've just handed me a blank piece of paper.
Leslie Knope, Oh! Wisdom! Finally.
Leslie Knope, Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope, You can also keep the photo.
Leslie Knope, Thanks for the memories.
Ron Swanson, Good God.
Ron Swanson, I don't remember this.
Leslie Knope, That-- That's the wrong one.
Leslie Knope, But the real one's very bad as well.
Leslie Knope," I want you to know that I'm replacing the ""Welcome Letter"" with this ad for Yearning by Dennis Feinstein."
Leslie Knope," So goodbye, distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience."
Leslie Knope," Hello, disgusting fragrance flap."
Ron Swanson, Let me buy you dinner.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, I insist you buy me dinner.
April Ludgate, Get a drink.
April Ludgate, Whatever.
April Ludgate, It's cool.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Bouncer, ID.
April Ludgate, I'm 24.
Bouncer," No, you're not."
April Ludgate," Okay, I'm 25."
April Ludgate," No old jokes, please."
Bouncer, ID.
Bouncer, It says right here you're 20.
Bouncer, You're not even gonna show me a fake?
April Ludgate,Sometimes the confidence confuses people.
Bouncer," You're good, bro."
Andy Dwyer, You know what? I think I'll just... I'm gonna--
April Ludgate,"Hey, I know another bar that always lets me in, if you just wanna go there."
Andy Dwyer," Uh... Yeah, actually, I should get going home."
Andy Dwyer, I have a lot of stuff to do.
Andy Dwyer," So, I should go home."
Andy Dwyer, Clean and stuff.
Andy Dwyer, But…
April Ludgate,"Yeah, okay, cool."
April Ludgate," Yeah, I gotta go home, too."
April Ludgate, So…
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer, See you!
April Ludgate,Later.
Ron Swanson," The usual, Marta."
Leslie Knope," Me, too, Marta."
Marta, You got it.
Leslie Knope," Oh, Ron, I really made love to the pooch on this one."
Ron Swanson, Screwed the pooch?
Leslie Knope,I don't like that term.
Leslie Knope, It's so vulgar.
Leslie Knope," Ron! That sucked, today."
Ron Swanson, I'm sorry.
Ron Swanson, There's no other way to say it.
Ron Swanson, They're a bunch of career bureaucrats.
Ron Swanson, What did you think they were gonna say to you?
Leslie Knope,"Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain that stretches back to when our town was founded, and we believe in you and we support you and we'll be following your career."
Leslie Knope," ""You are the chosen one."""
Leslie Knope,Or something.
Ron Swanson," Well, okay, so, that was the problem."
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director.
Leslie Knope, But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with.
Leslie Knope, Are we gonna hate each other someday?
Ron Swanson,I don't think so.
Ron Swanson, I think we're gonna be fine.
Leslie Knope," Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere."
Leslie Knope," I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, so… Maybe I should go somewhere."
Leslie Knope," Maybe I should move, to Eagleton."
Leslie Knope," Oh, God, the thought of that."
Ron Swanson," Leslie, you don't have to move to Eagleton."
Ron Swanson," When I become City Manager, my job is yours."
Ron Swanson," Of course, my first act as City Manager will be to propose eliminating the Parks Department."
Ron Swanson, Although I expect a spirited debate with Leslie.
Leslie Knope, Who knows what the future holds for me?
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.
Leslie Knope," Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department."
Leslie Knope," Although, I do expect a fight from Ron."
Leslie Knope, But I'll win.
Ron Swanson, Mmm!
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, darling."
Leslie Knope, Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food?
Ron Swanson,"People are idiots, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich, The wait is over!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Jerry Gergich,Yeah! Look what's here.
Jerry Gergich, We got--
Leslie Knope,"""My fellow Pawneeans, Yes, it's here! The Parks Department's Summer Catalog has arrived and for the first time in 20 years, tennis is back! Peruse this wondrous book at your leisure and take advantage of everything this great town has to offer."""
Leslie Knope," ""Time is fleeting, my fellow Pawneeans."""
Leslie Knope," ""Make the most of it, while you can."""
Leslie Knope," ""I recently had the honor of spending an afternoon""with every living former Parks Director, and they taught me a valuable lesson, there is nothing more important than friendship."""
Ron Swanson,It's a little flowery.
Leslie Knope, Shut up.
Ron Swanson, I gotta hand it to Michael.
Ron Swanson, His water pipe making skills were most impressive.
Ron Swanson, I once saw him smoke pot out of a 20-foot length of garden hose and a milk jug.
Ron Swanson, That guy made a water pipe out of a stuffed raccoon.
Leslie Knope, No way.
Leslie Knope," No, I'm not kidding."
Leslie Knope, He made a bong out of a taxidermied raccoon?
Ron Swanson,I caught him smoking pot out of it not three feet from where we're standing.
Leslie Knope," Oh, nice shot."
Ron Swanson, Right in Clarence's ancient junk.
Leslie Knope, In the neck!

Mark Brendanawicz,"Leslie, can I run something by you really quick?"
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,I love having things run by me.
Mark Brendanawicz,I feel like you're being sarcastic right now.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,I'm not.
Leslie Knope,I genuinely love it.
Leslie Knope,Run it by me.
Leslie Knope,Go ahead!
Leslie Knope,"Go, go, go."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Okay, so I've been a little worried that Ann maybe thinks that our relationship isn't moving forward fast enough."
Mark Brendanawicz,And so I'm wondering if maybe I should ask her if she would like to move in with me.
Mark Brendanawicz,Good idea?
Mark Brendanawicz,Bad idea?
Mark Brendanawicz,You tell me.
Leslie Knope,"I would say that some women won't consider moving in with someone unless they think marriage is in the future, which I know, for you is--"
Mark Brendanawicz,I intend to marry her.
Leslie Knope,For realskies?
Leslie Knope,I'm not really quite sure how I feel.
Leslie Knope,I-- It's a little weird.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm happy for them."
Leslie Knope,They're my friends.
Leslie Knope,It makes me a little nauseous.
Leslie Knope,"If I could just sum it up in one word, it would be… oh…"
April Ludgate,Parks and Rec.
April Ludgate,Confirming what?
April Ludgate,That's not possible.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,Good morning.
April Ludgate,Why are there six people outside who say they're waiting to meet with me?
April Ludgate,"So, you know how you love me because you haven't had a single meeting with anyone since I became your assistant?"
April Ludgate,"That's because every time someone calls and requests a meeting with you, I always schedule it for March 31st."
Ron Swanson,Why?
April Ludgate,Because I didn't think March 31st existed.
April Ludgate,"Thirty days has September, April, March and November--"
Ron Swanson,June and November.
Ron Swanson,Today is March 31st.
April Ludgate,I know.
Ron Swanson,"So, then, how many meetings do I have today?"
April Ludgate,93
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you know what to do."
April Ludgate,Right.
Ron Swanson,"To me, this situation is a bloodsoaked, nightmarish hellscape."
Ron Swanson,"However, to Leslie Knope…"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, how fun!"
April Ludgate,Yay!
Ron Swanson,"Why don't you take as many as you can, and I'll cover the rest."
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,"Why don't I try to rustle up seven more meetings, 'cause I think it would be cooler if there were an even 100"
Ron Swanson,Just-- Why don't we just stick to these 93 and see how it goes?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect distraction for me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I have everything I need, right?"
Leslie Knope,"I have a fresh cup of coffee, comfy furlined boots."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna need those boots back by the end of the day.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no problem."
Leslie Knope,They're actually a little narrow for me.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, here's a guy."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director."
Bill Haggerty,"Bill Haggerty, Pawnee Historical Society."
Bill Haggerty,I'm supposed to be meeting with Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,I understand that.
Leslie Knope,He's tied up right now.
Bill Haggerty,What a shocker.
Bill Haggerty,"I've been trying to meet with him for three months, and now he's not available."
Bill Haggerty,"It's probably too late now, but, some rich woman, Jessica Wicks, has rented out Turnbill Mansion for a party, and she's making alterations."
Leslie Knope,"""Alterations""?"
Leslie Knope,Turnbill Mansion is one of the most beloved historical sites in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"In 1867, the progressive Reverend Turnbill officiated a wedding between a white woman and a Wamapoke Indian chief."
Leslie Knope,The secret ceremony was beautiful and romantic.
Leslie Knope,"But then word got out, and the reception was a bloodbath."
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, there were two survivors."
Leslie Knope,"Unfortunately, they were both horses."
Tom Haverford,Hold up.
Tom Haverford,Former beauty queen Jessica Wicks?
Bill Haggerty,Yes.
Tom Haverford,I'm Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna be running point on this, Bill."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, why didn't you try to stop her?"
Bill Haggerty,Her husband is Nick Newport Sr. from Sweetums.
Bill Haggerty,Everyone in this town is afraid to say no to him.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody just relax."
Leslie Knope,What alterations is she trying to make?
Leslie Knope,"Drilling holes, painting, removing wainscoting, she's tearing down the gazebo."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,She's what?
Leslie Knope,"No, she's not."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, go get the car."
Tom Haverford,Ow!
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,Don't throw things at me.
Leslie Knope,"God, these are tight!"
Extra,I'll devise an action plan to help us coordinate better among the departments.
Ron Swanson,Will you?
Ron Swanson,Great.
Ron Swanson,Thanks for coming in.
Extra,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Who's next?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I'll meet you at the car."
Ron Swanson,Where the hell are you going?
Ron Swanson,We have 91 more meetings!
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ron, as much as I would like to go for the ""all-time City Hall single day meetings record,"" there is an emergency."
Leslie Knope,Someone is trying to alter a gazebo.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I can't hang out.
Leslie Knope,I kind of have an emergency.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I'm actually here to see Mark."
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thanks for the coffee."
Ann Perkins,That's also for Mark.
Leslie Knope,"I really need it, though."
Leslie Knope,"But next time more sugar, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, bye."
April Ludgate,Do you want me to postpone the rest?
April Ludgate,Or I could set myself on fire and create a diversion?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna do all of these today.
Ron Swanson,Round up whoever's free.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need more Ron Swansons.
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,It's gorgeous.
Leslie Knope,What kind of monster would wanna change this?
Tom Haverford,Pre-zit.
Tom Haverford,Do you have any brown concealer by any chance?
Tom Haverford,I need to look good for Jessica.
Leslie Knope,"You know, they may be rich, but they can't just destroy history."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,I'm right behind you.
Tom Haverford,I just need to spend a minute in my cologne cloud.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Tom Haverford,Attack by Dennis Feinstein.
Tom Haverford,When you wanna attack the senses of the lady you wanna bed.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,Door!
Tom Haverford,Door!
Tom Haverford,"Door, door!"
Tom Haverford,Close it!
Ron Swanson,"So basically, we're completely swamped."
Ron Swanson,All hands on deck.
Ann Perkins,I don't even work in this building.
Ron Swanson,Don't care.
Ann Perkins,I need anyone with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, do you need help with anything?"
Ron Swanson,"No, we're good."
Ron Swanson,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, you can head home early."
Ron Swanson,"Right, now the four of us are gonna divvy up all these meetings."
Ron Swanson,Just make them feel like they've been heard.
Ron Swanson,Understood?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI, on the case."
Ron Swanson,"April, you take Leslie's office."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, you're in the conference room."
Ron Swanson,"Ann, take your meetings in the courtyard."
Ron Swanson,Just sit there and don't ruin the city.
Ron Swanson,Dismissed.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,Can I get a badge?
April Ludgate,"Hey, I brought you a coffee, help you get through the day."
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, dude!"
April Ludgate,"No problem, lady!"
April Ludgate,I'm gonna go.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,April is the best but she's 20.
Andy Dwyer,"When April was born, I was already in third grade, which means if we were friends back then, I'd have been hanging out with a baby."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know anything about infant care.
Andy Dwyer,"My God, I could have killed her!"
Leslie Knope,"Ah, Mr. Newport Sr. I've just been informed that you plan on altering this mansion."
Leslie Knope,"And as a member of the Parks Department, as a Pawneean and an American, I ask you to refrain from harming this historic structure."
Nick Newport Sr.,What?
Jessica Wicks,"I'll take care of this, love nut."
Nick Newport Sr.,Biscuit.
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,"Hi, I'm Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, yes."
Leslie Knope,We've met before.
Leslie Knope,We were both judges at the pageant last year.
Jessica Wicks,Leslie Knorp.
Jessica Wicks,Of course!
Jessica Wicks,How are you?
Tom Haverford,Jessica Wicks.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, boo!"
Tom Haverford,Are you aging in reverse?
Tom Haverford,'Cause you look barely legal.
Jessica Wicks,Tom Haverford.
Jessica Wicks,If you're not the most charming man in Indiana.
Tom Haverford,And this must be the luckiest man in Indiana.
Tom Haverford,"Sir, it is an honor to meet you."
Tom Haverford,"Come here, you!"
Nick Newport Sr.,"Tell me straight, are you a Chinese?"
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,I'm one of the Indian people.
Tom Haverford,That floppy old bag of money is gonna be dead in like a month.
Tom Haverford,And who's going to comfort Jessica and her millions of dollars?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, Jessica is a gold digger."
Tom Haverford,But I'm a gold digger digger.
Tom Haverford,"So, how did you and Mr. Newport meet?"
Jessica Wicks,"I was doing a ribbon cutting at the hospital, and he was there because his blood doesn't work."
Jessica Wicks,"And we started talking, and then I realized who he was."
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, my gosh!"
Jessica Wicks,It was love at first sight!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that sounds so romantic."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Jessica, I know you've rented out this house for a party."
Leslie Knope,"But it's on the historical register, so we can't allow any changes."
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Jessica Wicks,"It's a little late for that, sweetheart."
Jessica Wicks,I told them what I was doing months ago.
Jessica Wicks,"Where I come from, there's a saying, ""What's done is done."""
Leslie Knope,That's a saying everywhere.
Tom Haverford,I've never heard it before and I think it's a great saying.
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we can just limit the damage."
Leslie Knope,How much have you done?
Leslie Knope,You painted this?
Jessica Wicks,Uh-huh.
Jessica Wicks,Miami Teal is Nicky's favorite color.
Jessica Wicks,"We also replaced some of the sconces, got rid of the furniture, painted these floors black."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,These were the original hardwood floors.
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,They were all scratched up.
Jessica Wicks,I did you a favor.
Jessica Wicks,Come on in here.
Jessica Wicks,I'll show you guys what we did in the sitting room.
Leslie Knope,I can't--
Tom Haverford,After you.
Tom Haverford,I'd hate to miss the view.
Jessica Wicks,You little devil.
Jessica Wicks,I should just pay you to follow me around.
Tom Haverford,"If that's a job offer, I accept."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to drill holes in the wall?
Jessica Wicks,To hang my birthday present to Nicky.
Tom Haverford,My heavens!
Leslie Knope,"Isn't there a way that you could've-- Oh, my!"
Leslie Knope,History is important.
Leslie Knope,You just can't go around changing everything all of the time.
Leslie Knope,"Or else next thing you know, they'll be painting the White House not white."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so angry, I can't think of another color."
Leslie Knope,Green.
Mel,"So, your department banned me from attending games just because I yell ""you suck"" at the players!"
Ron Swanson,"According to the complaint, you yelled it at five year old girls."
Mel,Who suck!
Mel,Why is that so hard to understand?
Extra,I thought I was having this meeting with Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate,I'm afraid that Ron Swanson's currently dead.
Extra,Oh.
April Ludgate,"I'm his daughter, April Swanson."
April Ludgate,And it's his last wish that I have this meeting with you.
Extra,"I represent the Ultimate Frisbee league, and--"
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee has an Ultimate league?
Extra,"Yes, and we keep running into conflicts with--"
Andy Dwyer,You won me over.
Andy Dwyer,I will join your team.
Extra,"I'm sorry, what we need--"
Andy Dwyer,When does practice start?
Andy Dwyer,And do you provide the jerseys?
Andy Dwyer,"What color are the jerseys, by the way?"
Andy Dwyer,What's our team name?
Andy Dwyer,Are we the Lightning?
Ann Perkins,"Now, I have to tell you, I don't actually work in the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,I'm a nurse.
Extra,Seriously?
Extra,That's great news.
Extra,I have the weirdest thing on my arm.
Extra,Can you see this?
Ann Perkins,Every time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God you haven't torn down the gazebo yet."
Jessica Wicks,Don't remind me.
Jessica Wicks,The demolition people couldn't get here until this afternoon.
Jessica Wicks,I've had to look at that ugly thing all day long.
Leslie Knope,Ugly thing?
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you a little something about this ""ugly thing,"" ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"A hundred and fifty years ago, an interracial couple was married here, and then slaughtered by their own families."
Leslie Knope,It's one of the most beautiful stories in Pawnee's history.
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to destroy it?
Jessica Wicks,Don't tell me about Pawnee history.
Jessica Wicks,The Newports made this town.
Jessica Wicks,"And tonight, we're gonna celebrate my husband's 85th birthday, without this mushy old pile of rot."
Leslie Knope,Your husband's a mushy old pile of rot.
Jessica Wicks,"You were a stick-in-the-mud when we judged that beauty pageant, and you're being a stick-in-the-mud now."
Leslie Knope,I am not a stick-in-the-mud!
Leslie Knope,I just want to stop a party from happening.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,"I have a gazebo update, so ignore all my previous voicemails and emails."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I haven't relieved myself in five hours, so, if you'll excuse me."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm sorry, but this can't wait."
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks refuses to--
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, what the [bleep]?"
Councilman Howser,Hey!
Councilman Howser,Miss Knope?
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser!
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,"Not that I saw anything, other than your face, and I would like to talk to you a little bit about this gazebo thing."
Leslie Knope,"You know, the problem--"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Ron Swanson,Enough of this.
Ron Swanson,Do whatever you want.
Ron Swanson,Alert the media.
Ron Swanson,"Call FEMA, I don't care."
Ron Swanson,Do not bother me with this again.
Councilman Howser,Miss Knope.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Leslie Knope,I saw your penis.
Extra,There are eight swings at Ramsett Park and every single one of them is broken.
Extra,Can you please just fix one of them?
Andy Dwyer,Ron told me I can't say yes to anything.
Andy Dwyer,But it's such a reasonable request.
Andy Dwyer,I can't just say no.
Extra,"So, that's a yes?"
Extra,Are you saying yes?
Extra,"Just say out loud, yes or no."
Andy Dwyer,Boop!
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, they do look a little bit swollen."
Ann Perkins,Just follow the pen.
Ann Perkins,Follow the pen to--
Ann Perkins,Does that hurt?
Extra,There's no way this ordinance goes through.
Extra,There's too much red tape.
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,This gridlock drives me nuts.
Extra,Tell me about it.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I think you're gonna have to make an end run.
April Ludgate,You know?
April Ludgate,Go right to the Commissioner on this one.
Extra,"You know what, I hadn't thought of that."
Extra,That is a really great idea.
April Ludgate,Yeah?
Extra,I'm gonna do that.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Your last resort is probably gonna be City Council.
Extra,Good luck there!
April Ludgate,Yeah!
April Ludgate,My thoughts exactly.
April Ludgate,I have no idea what I was saying.
Extra,I ask you.
Extra,Is this too revealing for a public pool?
Ron Swanson,Kindly get your groin off my desk.
Extra,"So my body makes you uncomfortable, too?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Mark."
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of freaking out about this historical mansion thing.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you for a second?
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm actually headed right out the door.
Leslie Knope,You're going on a date with Ann.
Mark Brendanawicz,Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz,"I was gonna surprise her, take her to a nice restaurant."
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Are you sure now?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, have a good time."
Ron Swanson,How we doing?
Andy Dwyer,Pretty good.
Andy Dwyer,I may have promised a new aquatic center to somebody.
Andy Dwyer,Is that a problem?
Ann Perkins,I diagnosed two melanomas.
Ann Perkins,They're both benign.
Ron Swanson,How many more meetings?
April Ludgate,Twenty.
Ron Swanson,April was supposed to be the moat that kept the citizen barbarians away from Swanson Castle.
Ron Swanson,Instead she blew up the castle and stabbed me in the face.
Ron Swanson,I hired you to do one thing.
Ron Swanson,Just one.
Ron Swanson,I don't care that you text all day and sleep at your desk.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, I encourage it."
Ron Swanson,But only because you were doing that one thing.
Ron Swanson,Keeping this crap off my desk.
Ron Swanson,Give me five minutes before the next one.
Ann Perkins,That guy is scary when he's angry.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,"God, I know."
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude."
April Ludgate,I don't need your sympathy.
April Ludgate,Or yours.
Ann Perkins,I wasn't offering my sympathy.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for meeting me here.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What's up?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I need you to get this word for word.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's a tape recorder.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So it will.
Leslie Knope,"""Gazebo?"""
Leslie Knope,"More like ""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,"She may be a former beauty queen, but today she's the king of destroying history!"""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, could you just maybe talk normally?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"""Gazoinksbo."""
Leslie Knope,Jessica Wicks is throwing a birthday party for her husband Nick Newport Sr. at the Turnbill Mansion tonight.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm gonna stop you right there.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Nick Newport Sr. is the former CEO of Sweetums.
Leslie Knope,So?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sweetums owns The Pawnee Journal.
Leslie Knope,Crap on the cob!
Ron Swanson,I will take it into consideration.
Ron Swanson,Thank God!
Ron Swanson,"That was it, right?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,There's one more.
Ron Swanson,Damn it to hell!
April Ludgate,It's with me and it's right now and it's about me quitting.
April Ludgate,I quit.
Leslie Knope,"I have no other choice, okay?"
Leslie Knope,This is the only rational way I know to prevent this tragedy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Here they come.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, throw away the key!"
Tom Haverford,Seriously?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Throw it!
Extra, Out of the way!
Leslie Knope," Sir, I'm sorry, but you're a little late."
Leslie Knope," So, you're gonna have to turn this thing around, 'cause you're not getting in here."
Leslie Knope," Oh, God! Tom! Stop him! Jump in front of it! Sacrifice your tiny body! I really thought that gate would open in the middle."
Leslie Knope," Well, the gazebo has been destroyed."
Leslie Knope, And the thing that bothers me the most--
Leslie Knope,"Cut it out, Tom."
Tom Haverford, It never gets old.
Leslie Knope," Hey, Ann and Mark are coming."
Leslie Knope," Guys, not so close."
Leslie Knope, You're gonna-- You're gonna-- Don't go past the sensor.
Tom Haverford,Sensor.
Leslie Knope,Sorry if I ruined your evening.
Ann Perkins," Leslie, it's totally fine."
Leslie Knope, I chained myself to a gate.
Ann Perkins, I can see that.
Mark Brendanawicz, Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,Nothing's bruised but my ego.
Leslie Knope," And my arm, a little, from the mechanized gate."
Andy Dwyer, Thanks again for letting me take those meetings today.
Andy Dwyer, I've never really had a meeting before.
Andy Dwyer, They're awesome.
Ron Swanson, You're welcome.
Andy Dwyer," Hey, have you seen April around? She usually comes by at the end of the day."
Ron Swanson, You might want to check her house.
Ron Swanson, She quit on me.
Andy Dwyer, What? Why?
Ron Swanson,She screwed up my entire life today.
Andy Dwyer, That was one mistake.
Andy Dwyer, She's perfect for you.
Andy Dwyer," Come on, there's no one in the world who's gonna do a better job for you than April."
Andy Dwyer, Either you hire her back or I quit.
Ron Swanson, You don't work for me.
Andy Dwyer," And I never will, sir."
Andy Dwyer, Good day.
Leslie Knope, So what'd you guys talk about at dinner? Huh? Was it fun? Any big decisions arrived at?
Ann Perkins,It was fine.
Mark Brendanawicz, Do you need a ride home?
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom's gonna take me."
Leslie Knope, You guys go on ahead.
Ann Perkins, I'm glad you're okay.
Ann Perkins, Call me tomorrow?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Bye, Leslie."
Larry Ludgate," Well, hello there."
Larry Ludgate, You must be Ron Swanson.
Larry Ludgate," Well, welcome to Casa Ludgate!"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Mr. Ludgate."
Larry Ludgate, Call me Larry.
Rita Ludgate," Larry, who is it?"
Larry Ludgate,It's Zuzu's boss.
Rita Ludgate," Oh, Ron."
Rita Ludgate, Rita Ludgate.
Rita Ludgate," Oh, you have no idea how nice it is to meet you."
Rita Ludgate," Come in, for gosh sake."
Rita Ludgate, What can I get you to drink? Ooh.
Rita Ludgate," Could you take your shoes off, please?"
Rita Ludgate,Thank you so much.
Ron Swanson," Nothing to drink, thanks."
Rita Ludgate," Oh, okay."
Ron Swanson, Is April around?
Larry Ludgate,"Zuzu, you have a guest."
Rita Ludgate, I'll fetch her.
Rita Ludgate, She's probably on the Internet again!
Larry Ludgate,I'll come with you.
Rita Ludgate, Okay.
Rita Ludgate, Okay.
Larry Ludgate," You make yourself at home, Mr. Swanson."
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
Ron Swanson, You must be April's sister.
Ron Swanson, I'm Ron.
Ron Swanson, Nice to meet you.
Tom Haverford," No offense, but I think the normal grieving time for gazebo destruction has passed."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, well, maybe that's not entirely what I'm upset about."
Leslie Knope, Mark and Ann are gonna get married.
Tom Haverford, Really? Why does that bother you?
Tom Haverford,I should be the one that's upset.
Tom Haverford, It was supposed to be me and Ann.
Tom Haverford, Or me and Jessica.
Tom Haverford, Or Ann and Jessica with me watching.
Leslie Knope," Every time a couple gets married, two single people die."
Leslie Knope, I'm about to lose two good friends.
Tom Haverford, Come on.
Tom Haverford, They drove over here and cut you down from a gate.
Tom Haverford, I really don't think you have to worry about them abandoning you once they get married.
Leslie Knope," Yeah, yeah, I know that."
Leslie Knope, In my brain.
Tom Haverford, Can we go?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Let's go.
Leslie Knope, I just need to…
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford, No!
Leslie Knope,...do one more thing.
Tom Haverford," No, no, no!"
Jessica Wicks,"Loving smiles and smiling tears, The midnight of my heart is you."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm sorry, everyone."
Leslie Knope, Excuse me.
Leslie Knope," Excuse me, but I need to say something."
Extra, Is that Gate Lady?
Leslie Knope,"I know you're probably thinking, ""There's that crazy gate lady from outside back again."""
Leslie Knope,"And to some extent, you're right."
Leslie Knope, I am the gate lady.
Leslie Knope, But the only thing I'm crazy about is leaving the past behind.
Leslie Knope," So, I would like to apologize and raise a glass to change and forgiveness and the future and Ann and Mark, and happiness and Nick Newport Sr."
Leslie Knope, May all your future gazebos live long and prosper.
Jessica Wicks, Please leave!
Leslie Knope,Is it weird if I ask to take a piece of cake with me? I won't.
Jessica Wicks, Go.

Ron Swanson, I want you to come back.
April Ludgate," Well, I don't want to come back."
April Ludgate, The end.
Ron Swanson," I was talking to Andy about you, and he made me realize that I need you back at work."
April Ludgate, What did he say?
Ron Swanson,Don't recall.
April Ludgate," Fine, I'll come back."
Ron Swanson, Good.
Ron Swanson," Okay, I'm leaving."
Ron Swanson," Bye, Zuzu."

Tom Haverford,"Hi, there."
Ron Swanson,What's going on here?
Leslie Knope,Puppy!
April Ludgate,A puppy is here!
Leslie Knope,Can we keep him?
Andy Dwyer,My neighbor's dog had a litter.
Andy Dwyer,They're looking for people to adopt.
April Ludgate,I love him.
Andy Dwyer,I wish he had tiny puppy shoes.
Andy Dwyer,I would totally shine his little shoes for free.
Andy Dwyer,I do say the cutest stuff.
Ron Swanson,"Look, I love a good dog as much as the next guy, but this building doesn't allow animals."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, take him outside."
Andy Dwyer,"What, and shoot him?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Just keep him outside.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I'm just a little puppy.
Tom Haverford,I ain't done nothing wrong.
Tom Haverford,I'm just a puppy.
Tom Haverford,I like your mustache.
Tom Haverford,I wish I could have one.
Tom Haverford,But I can't.
Tom Haverford,Because I'm just a little puppy.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, take him out and shoot him."
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Leslie Knope,Fire!
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Where?
Leslie Knope,In my belly.
Leslie Knope,Because the 24 hour Pawnee Cares Diabetes Telethon starts tonight.
Ron Swanson,Goody.
Ron Swanson,Let us know how it went.
Leslie Knope,"Every year, Pawnee Cares teams up with the local cable access station to raise money for diabetes research."
Leslie Knope,"And it's important, because Pawnee is the fourth fattest town in the U.S."
Leslie Knope,"It goes us, Dallas, Tulsa and certain parts of The Mall of America."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this year, I get to program my own four hour block."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Exciting!
Leslie Knope,"So, I have signed you all up for multiple shifts."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, just to answer phones and provide moral support."
Tom Haverford,From when to when?
Leslie Knope,Tonight.
Leslie Knope,From 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, please."
Jerry Gergich,Tonight's kind of a big night.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, all my kids are away, and…"
Tom Haverford,Gross!
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,It's Jerry's sex night.
Tom Haverford,That ruins sex and tonight.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you put on one of these Tshirts?
Leslie Knope,It will get you in the mood.
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night last night making these.
Tom Haverford,You stayed up all night the night before an all night telethon.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,And here's why.
Leslie Knope,Boom.
Tom Haverford,"""Diabetes."""
Tom Haverford,"""Let's Dia-beat-this."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to come up with the slogan.
Leslie Knope,Four hours to embroider them.
Tom Haverford,Time well spent.
Leslie Knope,Salad sucks.
Leslie Knope,There.
Leslie Knope,I said it.
Mark Brendanawicz,Feel better?
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Mark Brendanawicz,I've been doing some thinking.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm not going to ask Ann to move in with me.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Is something wrong?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Mark Brendanawicz,I love her.
Mark Brendanawicz,And I want a partner.
Leslie Knope,Horseback.
Leslie Knope,You should ask her on horseback.
Mark Brendanawicz,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, you should ask her in a hot air balloon."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"She should be on the hot air balloon, and you should ride up on horseback."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"She's in the balloon, you ride up on horseback, you point to the sky, up there, skywriting, ""Marry me, Ann."""
Mark Brendanawicz,I think I can figure out the right way to ask her.
Leslie Knope,How you ask someone to marry you is a very big deal.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they have to repeat that story for the rest of their lives."
Mark Brendanawicz,"So, you think I should do it, though."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Definitely.
Leslie Knope,Can you get five eagles?
Leslie Knope,"No, get ten eagles."
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"No, you're right."
Leslie Knope,It's your life.
Leslie Knope,Get as many eagles as you want.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom, you're in for tonight, right?"
Tom Haverford,I forgot to tell you.
Tom Haverford,"I can't make it to the telethon tonight, because I have no interest in being there."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You're in charge of the VIP special telethon guest.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to believe who I got.
Leslie Knope,People are going to freak out.
Tom Haverford,Rihanna.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Dr. Oz.
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,You're never going to guess.
Tom Haverford,Justin Bieber.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Ex- lndiana Pacers small forward, Detlef Schrempf."
Tom Haverford,The Detlef Schrempf?
Leslie Knope,I know!
Leslie Knope,"So, it's really exciting."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Leslie Knope,And I need you to be his bodyman.
Leslie Knope,Pick him up at the airport at 7:00 p.m.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you know, just entertain him."
Leslie Knope,Because he doesn't need to be in hair and makeup until 2:00 a.m.
Tom Haverford,Does Pawnee Cable Access even have hair and makeup?
Leslie Knope,"Well, they have a communal lipstick and a box of combs."
Ann Perkins,"As a nurse and as your friend, I highly suggest you don't try to stay up for the next 24 hours."
Leslie Knope,I can definitely do it.
Leslie Knope,I've already been up for 24 hours.
Leslie Knope,But I have a secret weapon.
Ann Perkins,NutriYum bars?
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,They're terrible.
Leslie Knope,But they give me an insane 15 minute burst.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, my nana used to tell me, ""You'll sleep when you're dead."""
Leslie Knope,"My nana, she used to say the best stuff."
Leslie Knope,"""Don't work yourself into a lather."""
Leslie Knope,"""Look where it is and you'll find it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Don't put me in a home."""
Leslie Knope,"""Tell the truth and shame the devil."""
Leslie Knope,"""The devil knows where you're hiding."""
Leslie Knope,"""If you take enough rides with the devil, pretty soon, he's going to drive."""
Leslie Knope,She was really into the devil.
Leslie Knope,I have not checked in with you lately.
Leslie Knope,I'm randomly and casually asking.
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Mark?
Ann Perkins,Things are good.
Leslie Knope,Do you think he's the one?
Ann Perkins,The one?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Ron Swanson,I'm here.
Ron Swanson,What do I have to do?
Leslie Knope,I have you on phone answering duty from 4:00 to 6:00 a.m.
Ron Swanson,That's horrible.
Ron Swanson,I have to nap up.
Ron Swanson,"If I don't get a solid five, it kills my sunny disposition."
Tom Haverford,Got enough leg room back there?
Detlef Schrempf,Yeah.
Detlef Schrempf,"Yeah, you don't have to sit so far up."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I do."
Tom Haverford,"So, Detlef Schrempf."
Tom Haverford,"Three time NBA All-Star, two time Sixth Man Award winner."
Tom Haverford,It must have been pretty cool to be traded to the Pacers in exchange for veteran center Herb Williams.
Detlef Schrempf,"So, you looked me up on Wikipedia, huh?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Everybody knows that.
Tom Haverford,Just like everybody knows you appeared in two episodes of the German soap opera Gute Zeiten Schlechte Zeiten.
Detlef Schrempf,"What, you a big fan of that show?"
Tom Haverford,Huge fan.
Detlef Schrempf,Huh?
Detlef Schrempf,"Oh, 6'10""."
Tom Haverford,"I'm 5'6"" and three quarters."
Leslie Knope,"All right, team, you guys psyched?"
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, all you need to do is take down everybody's name and address and ask them how much they want to donate."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, do these phones dial out?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Donna Meagle,No reason.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you know what?"
Jerry Gergich,My phone has 25 lines.
Jerry Gergich,I think it might be a switchboard.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, then."
Leslie Knope,You got the most lines.
Leslie Knope,"Figure it out, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"Come on, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Everyone else has one line.
Joan Callamezzo,Oh!
Joan Callamezzo,"So, Leslie, I hear you're going to be in front of the camera this year."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's exciting.
Joan Callamezzo,Cut the chatter.
Joan Callamezzo,Telehosting?
Joan Callamezzo,Not as easy as it looks.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay?
Joan Callamezzo,This isn't CSPAN.
Joan Callamezzo,This is Local Access 46.

Ann Perkins,Your shift doesn't start for another six hours.
Joan Callamezzo,Diabetes.
Joan Callamezzo,Yuck.
Joan Callamezzo,"Tonight, we're hoping the people of Pawnee dig their big, chubby hands into their plus-size pockets and donate generously."
Martin Housely,"Weird, wacky stuff."
Joan Callamezzo,Stop it.
Martin Housely,"Coming up, a very special video presentation called Even My Tongue is Fat: The Story of Pawnee."
Martin Housely,"But right now, to begin with, let's start things off in our telethon with a song."
Martin Housely,"From Pawnee's most bookable personality, Denise Yermley!"
Denise Yermley,Sweet dreams are made of this

Freddy,"Oh, you can't leave."
Freddy,"Tommy, this is the most business the club's done in months."
Tom Haverford,But I've got to get him to the telethon.
Freddy,He's not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."

Leslie Knope,"Guys, has anyone seen Tom?"

Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I suffer from a disorder called sleep fighting.
Leslie Knope,That must be terrible.
Ron Swanson,Only when I'm losing.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm freaking out, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom is not here, and he's got Detlef Schrempf."

Jerry Gergich,"No, but I'm a very good piano player."
Jerry Gergich,I'd be happy to go up there and give it a shot.
Leslie Knope,Why are you wasting my time?
Leslie Knope,This is really serious!
Ron Swanson,You go keep your eye out for Tom.
Ron Swanson,I've got this covered.
Ron Swanson,"When recaning an old chair, one needs to make sure that one has all the right elements in place."

April Ludgate,You sound really strong.
April Ludgate,"Hey, why don't you forget about the donation and just come down here and meet me in person."

Andy Dwyer,Funny girl you were talking to?
Barney,When it comes to preparing taxes…
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is a disaster.
Barney,The only thing that's taxing is deciding which software to buy.
Leslie Knope,I am completely screwed.
Leslie Knope,"I have no Schrempf, no backup plan, no more NutriYum bars."
Leslie Knope,What do people want to watch?
Leslie Knope,Cute animals on a bike?
Leslie Knope,No time to train one.
Leslie Knope,Hot people kissing?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Mark and Ann would…
Mark Brendanawicz,Have you ever seen this man sleep?
Mark Brendanawicz,It's like underwater ballet.
Leslie Knope,I have a great idea.
Mark Brendanawicz,What's that?
Leslie Knope,I think you should propose to Ann tonight.
Leslie Knope,Today.
Leslie Knope,Whatever it is.
Leslie Knope,On camera.
Leslie Knope,For diabetes.
Mark Brendanawicz,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,It would be so cool.

Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,Most women do.
Mark Brendanawicz,"On television, though?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but…"
Mark Brendanawicz,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,We talked about it being something big.
Mark Brendanawicz,Right.
Leslie Knope,And I don't think we can get a hot air balloon at this time of night.
Mark Brendanawicz,I have my grandma's ring.
Mark Brendanawicz,I guess I could go home and get it.
Leslie Knope,Is there a story behind it?
Leslie Knope,Was she on the Titanic?
Leslie Knope,Was she on the Titanic?
Mark Brendanawicz,No.
Mark Brendanawicz,She was just my grandma.
Mark Brendanawicz,It would make a great story.
Mark Brendanawicz,I trust Leslie.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't know.
Mark Brendanawicz,What do you think I should do?
Barney,And that concludes a quick look at QuickBooks Pro.

Leslie Knope,"But coming soon, a really amazing thing is going to happen."
Leslie Knope,"So, get your wallets out or get your handkerchiefs out."
Leslie Knope,"Or get your tissues out, if you're like me and think handkerchiefs are gross."
Leslie Knope,"For now, please, let's take a look at this moving video entitled, One Butt, Two Seats: The Widening of America."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, Ann!"

Leslie Knope,What did you want to talk to me about?
Ann Perkins,No worries.
Ann Perkins,It can wait.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Ann Perkins,I think I need to break up with Mark.
Ann Perkins,I've just been feeling for a while like something's missing.
Ann Perkins,"And I kept thinking about the question you asked me today, about whether or not he's the one."
Ann Perkins,And he's not.
Leslie Knope,Mark really loves you.
Leslie Knope,I think he's ready to take this to the next step.
Ann Perkins,He doesn't know what he's ready for.
Ann Perkins,But I think I do.
Leslie Knope,I guess you're just going to have to marry him and figure it out.
Ann Perkins,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Why would you do that?
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,No.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Good for you, Ann."

Joe From Sewage," Whatever, man."
Joe From Sewage, I work for the Sewage Department.
Joe From Sewage, I'm up to my waist in hot snizz.

Leslie Knope, So I will now drink eight glasses of milk in three minutes.
Ann Perkins, No.
Ann Perkins," No, you won't."
Ann Perkins," No, you won't."
Ann Perkins," Because if you do that, you will die."
Leslie Knope, Oh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope, All right.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Enough of that racket.
Leslie Knope," Well, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope, It's almost 6:00 in the morning.
Leslie Knope,"And, we need to keep those donations coming in."
Leslie Knope," I know we promised a special event coming up, and…"
Mark Brendanawicz,Leslie.
Leslie Knope, No.
Mark Brendanawicz, Should I come up now?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, What we're going to do is we're going to pull our pants down.
Leslie Knope, That's what we're going to do.
Leslie Knope, Everyone's gonna pull their pants down for diabetes.
Leslie Knope," Okay? On one, two"
Tom Haverford,"Turn my swag on, Took a look in the mirror, said, ""What's up?"""
Tom Haverford,"Detlef, are you sure you don't want me to drive? I'm good to drive."
Tom Haverford," You want to come up and play video games? Whoa! Pull over, man."
Tom Haverford, That place has good chicken.
Tom Haverford, I'm hungry.
Joan Callamezzo," You just love flashing your ass, don't you?"
Leslie Knope,"When it's for a good cause, Joan."
Tom Haverford, What's up!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's here."
Tom Haverford," Wake up, Pawnee! Tommy Timberlake is in the house! And you know who else is with me? Detlef Schrempf! Tell them what they won, son!"
Detlef Schrempf,All right.
Detlef Schrempf," Thanks, Tom."
Detlef Schrempf," Well, on behalf of the Detlef Schrempf Foundation, I would like to present this check for 5,000 dollars for diabetes research."
Tom Haverford," Oh, man! Yeah."
Leslie Knope, Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope," Big man, big check."
Tom Haverford," By the way, I'm drunk."
Tom Haverford, And if anybody out there--
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't understand.
Mark Brendanawicz, What happened?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope, I think I was a little tired when I told you that you should do that.
Leslie Knope, I don't think that that's something Ann wants.
Leslie Knope, Not on TV.
Mark Brendanawicz," So, that's why you pulled your pants down."
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Wait, what did I do?"
Perd Hapley,It's 6:04 a.m. and I'm Perd Hapley of Channel 4 Eyewitness News.
Perd Hapley, And the story of this next dance is that it's called The Worm.
Ron Swanson," Good morning, Knope."
Leslie Knope," Morning, Ron."
Ron Swanson," Everything running smoothly? You know, I'm happy to go back out there, demonstrate more of my skills."
Ron Swanson, How to start a fire without matches.
Ron Swanson, How to build a cribbage board.
Leslie Knope," No, I'm okay."
Leslie Knope, Thanks.
Ron Swanson, Get some sleep.
Leslie Knope," Aye-aye, Captain."
Ron Swanson," What the [bleep] are you doing, Perd Hapley?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins, Leslie? What are you doing here? Why aren't you sleeping?
Leslie Knope,I just I thought maybe you'd want to talk more about all the crazy stuff going on.
Ann Perkins, I do.
Ann Perkins, I really do.
Ann Perkins, Thanks.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," I've just got to tell you, I'm a little tired."
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Leslie Knope," So, I may have parked on your front lawn."
Ann Perkins, You did.
Leslie Knope, I did.
Ann Perkins, Oh!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins, It's... Just come in before anybody Leslie and I had an amazing talk.
Ann Perkins, It was so great of her to come over here.
Ann Perkins, Even though she was exhausted beyond belief.
Ann Perkins," Anyway, after we talked, she fell asleep on my couch."
Ann Perkins, And she's been asleep for 22 hours.
Ann Perkins, It's amazing what she slept through.
Ann Perkins, No way.
Ann Perkins," At one point, I thought she was up…"
Ann Perkins,Hold on.
Ann Perkins, Hi.
Ann Perkins, Hey.
Ann Perkins," But then, she went right back to sleep."
Ann Perkins, I've been monitoring her vital signs.
Ann Perkins, She's totally fine.
Ann Perkins, I love her so much.
Ann Perkins, But I think I'm going to draw a mustache on her face.

Leslie Knope,"Okay, open this one. Here, I'll help you."
April Ludgate,Whoa! Documents.
Leslie Knope,"Yes. This is your original intern application, your original parking pass. This is your original photo ID."
April Ludgate,Did you get that out of my purse?
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,And this is a copy of your very first paycheck.
Tom Haverford,Who's that from?
Leslie Knope,Me. It's from me.
Leslie Knope,Happy birthday.
April Ludgate,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Open mine.
Leslie Knope,"It is, it's nice. I mean it can be a little sentimental to kind of frame things, but its always nice to remember the beginning of something, you know, the start. And when you--"
April Ludgate,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for God's sake."
Ron Swanson,She's an adult now.
Ron Swanson,She should know how to responsibly handle and discharge a weapon.
Ron Swanson,"That there is a Sig Sauer .22 caliber Mosquito, manufactured in Switzerland for their pussy police force."
Ron Swanson,"This two toned, lightweight model is perfect for a skinny, little thing like you."
April Ludgate,"Gee, thanks Ron."
Ron Swanson,"I will hold onto this for you until we get you licensed up, and then I'll take you for some target practice."
April Ludgate,Goody.
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I do feel a little guilty."
Ron Swanson,I'm re-gifting.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's great."
Andy Dwyer,I'd love to hear all about your family vacation.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank God."
Andy Dwyer,"Get out, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, birthday girl."
Andy Dwyer,Got you a birthday present.
Andy Dwyer,Did you like that?
April Ludgate,Yes. 
Andy Dwyer,That high five was your birthday present.
Andy Dwyer,Just kidding.
Andy Dwyer,That wasn't it.
Andy Dwyer,I got you something else.
Andy Dwyer,I wrote you a song.
April Ludgate,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,What's it called?
Andy Dwyer,Not telling.
Andy Dwyer,But I'll give you a clue.
Andy Dwyer,It's named after a month out of the year.
April Ludgate,So April?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,That would have been way better.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,I can rewrite the lyrics.
April Ludgate,Are you coming to my party?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I wouldn't miss it for the world."
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,"Okay, cool."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, we'll hang out then."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,It's going to be fun.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I am 21 years old today."
April Ludgate,Which is the age that pretty much everyone agrees makes you an adult.
Leslie Knope,"In the words of the great 19th century outdoorsman Jack London, you can't wait for inspiration. You have to go after it with a club."
Leslie Knope,"With those words ringing in our ears, we proudly present our plans for a new park on municipal lot 48."
Ann Perkins,That's good!
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,The yearly budget and planning proposal for a city is called the Master Plan.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that just so awesome you can't stand it?
Leslie Knope,"It's mostly filled with boring, bureaucratic language, so I try to spice it up a little."
Leslie Knope,"So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry rot."
Ann Perkins,You wrote that?
Leslie Knope,"Jack London, again."
Leslie Knope,Is there too many Jack London quotes?
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, you can never have enough."
Ann Perkins,That is easily the most exciting budget proposal I have ever heard.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm presenting it today."
Leslie Knope,"And if it flies, we are going to get our money to build a park."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it only took us 15 months to do this."
Ann Perkins,I can't believe it.
Leslie Knope,"Would've taken 13 months if you had agreed to work on weekends, but still, it's great."
Ann Perkins,It's amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the meeting's at 10:00, come over to my office for champagne after."
Ann Perkins,I don't think I should do that.
Leslie Knope,"Oh right, Mark. Oh, awkward."
Ann Perkins,I ended things with Mark a couple of days ago.
Ann Perkins,"And, I'm not gonna talk about it."
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your final warning."
Tom Haverford,Do not miss tonight's April Ludgate birthday bash.
Tom Haverford,"9:00 P.M. at the world famous Snakehole Lounge, the place that the Pawnee Jounal has called the sexiest, most dangerous club in town."
Leslie Knope,That's not what they wrote.
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I added the world ""sexiest,"" but we've hired better security."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I am a good friend for throwing the party."
Tom Haverford,"I'm also a genius, because I'm using the occasion to stock the club with every available hottie I know."
Tom Haverford,"Call me a romantic, but I believe by the end of the night, I will have between one and four new girlfriends."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I can't believe our little girl's all grown up."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn the wheel of the world."
Leslie Knope,Why must it continually turn over?
Ron Swanson,Jack London.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Nice.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go boss. We have a meeting to go to."
Ron Swanson,Yay.
Ron Swanson,"Once a year, every branch of this government meets in a room and announces what they intend to waste taxpayer money on."
Ron Swanson,"For a libertarian such as myself, it's philosophically horrifying. They also really cheap out on snacks."
Ron Swanson,Hydrax cookies? Did you know there was a off-brand Hydrox? I did not. They're not bad.
Paul,"Good morning, everybody."
Paul,"I know you all have your budget presentations ready, but there's a change of plans."
Paul,"Due to the crippling gridlock in City Council, we are postponing all planning and spending decisions indefinitely."
Leslie Knope,Until when?
Paul,Indefinitely.
Leslie Knope,And when will that end?
Paul,Later than now.
Leslie Knope,"So this week, probably?"
Paul,"Look, we are bordering on a full-blown crisis, Leslie."
Paul,The state government is sending a team from Indianapolis to try to solve this budget problem.
Leslie Knope,"""In the event the master plan meeting is cut short"", ""in the event I have laryngitis and I present the master plan"", ""in the event the master plan meeting is moved onto a boat."""
Leslie Knope,Look I'm prepared for every sitaution… except for the one where there's no master plan.
Ron Swanson,Just calm down.
Ron Swanson,You don't even know what they're going to do.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, they're state auditors."
Leslie Knope,They're not gonna come to pat us on the back.
Leslie Knope,They're here to slash and burn.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I'd be fine with that. This government is diseased."
Ron Swanson,"It's like a big, fat, angry slob spending money it doesn't have on crap it doesn't need."
Ron Swanson,"Mmm, mmm, mmm, me want more pointless social programs."
Ron Swanson,"Yummy, yummy, yum."
Leslie Knope,"That's what government does, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It provides services.
Leslie Knope,They're going to try to eliminate everything we do.
Leslie Knope,We got to fight these guys.
Ron Swanson,They've been sent by the Governor.
Ron Swanson,They outrank everyone.
Ron Swanson,There's no fight to be had here.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right."
Leslie Knope,I'm not going to fight them.
Leslie Knope,Except that I am.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, Leslie, what do we do when we get this angry?"
Leslie Knope,"We count backwards from 1,000 by sevens, and we think of warm brownies."
Ron Swanson,Go do that in your office.
Leslie Knope,Go do it in your office.
Ron Swanson,And we'll wait for these guys to show up.
Leslie Knope,I'll wait for you to show up.
Tom Haverford,You don't need to bring anything but your gorgeous body.
Tom Haverford,"And get this: cover charge is normally 15 dollars. Say my name at the door, it's 13.50."
Tom Haverford,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"You coming out tonight, part owner of the club?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, let me ask you a quick question."
Andy Dwyer,"What's the youngest a girl can be that if we go out, I'm not a total scumbag?"
Tom Haverford,You know the old rule.
Tom Haverford,Half your age plus seven.
Andy Dwyer,Half my age plus seven.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm 29, so half of 29."
Andy Dwyer,Add seven.
Andy Dwyer,That's only 20... Is...
Tom Haverford,21
Andy Dwyer,20 years old.
Andy Dwyer,21
Tom Haverford,and a half.
Andy Dwyer,21 years old and a half.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer,We got the same thing with the equation on that one.
Andy Dwyer,Here's the thing.
Andy Dwyer,What if she's slightly younger?
Andy Dwyer,Can I go out with someone younger than that?
Tom Haverford,"Please, you totally can."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Tom says it's okay.
Andy Dwyer,That probably means it isn't okay.
Mark Brendanawicz,Thank you for meeting with me again.
Mark Brendanawicz,I don't even know really what I want to say.
Mark Brendanawicz,But I guess I just don't get it.
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, our relationship was so great."
Ann Perkins,"Mark, honestly, it was really nice."
Ann Perkins,"But maybe you thought it was so amazing, because you've never dated someone for so long before."
Mark Brendanawicz,"Well, but for example, we barely ever fought."
Ann Perkins,That's not a good sign.
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to fight sometimes.
Ann Perkins,You're supposed to miss the other person even if they're only gone for 20 minutes.
Ann Perkins,And I just didn't feel that.
Ann Perkins,Did you?
Mark Brendanawicz,"Man, I should have yelled at you way more."
Ron Swanson,"Well, Paul just called."
Ron Swanson,They're on their way.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, God."
Jerry Gergich,"They're going to fire people, aren't they?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I am two years from my pension."
Leslie Knope,"Relax, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,We don't know that.
Leslie Knope,Maybe these people are very helpful and pleasant.
Extra,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Death!
Extra,Divorce filings?
Ron Swanson,Fourth floor.
Chris Traeger,"Hello, hello."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, how are you?"
Chris Traeger,"Hello, there."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,This is Ben.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, gents."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm Deputy Director Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,It is fantastic to be here.
Leslie Knope,Would you gentlemen like a tour?
Chris Traeger,There is quite literally nothing I would rather have in the world than a tour of the Parks and Recreation Department of the great City of Pawnee led by Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Ben?
Ben Wyatt,I don't think that's a great idea.
Chris Traeger,Let's do it!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Chris is the most positive state budget auditing consultant I have ever met.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun."
Chris Traeger,"People, we are here from the state budget office from Indianapolis."
Chris Traeger,Ooh.
Chris Traeger,What does that mean?
Chris Traeger,"Look, simply we are here to tinker with your budget."
Chris Traeger,Think of the government as a broken down carousel.
Chris Traeger,"We're going to slap on a new coat of paint, we are going to fix that broken speaker system, and we are going to get those happy kids back up on the horses where they belong!"
Chris Traeger,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, that's not bad."
Chris Traeger,There it is.
Chris Traeger,"My partner, Ben, is going to stick around for a little bit, and I will see you all later."
Chris Traeger,Adios!
Ben Wyatt,Do you have a second?
Leslie Knope,I really like your shirt.
Ben Wyatt,So I'd like to talk about where you think there's waste within your department.
Ron Swanson,Where do I start?
Leslie Knope,There is none.
Ron Swanson,What exactly will you be cutting?
Ron Swanson,And how much of it?
Ron Swanson,And can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's start with personnel."
Ben Wyatt,What can you tell me about Jerry Gergich?
Leslie Knope,He is one of the best people on the planet.
Leslie Knope,He's universally adored here.
Leslie Knope,"If you fired him, there would be a revolt."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you need to understand that just to keep this town afloat, we probably have to cut the budget of every department by 40 or 50%."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, he said that because that sounds a lot better than ""We're going to gut it with a machete."""
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,You're a jerk.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings."
Ben Wyatt,This building has feelings?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of history in this one.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it does.
Leslie Knope,How can you be so blase about this?
Ben Wyatt,"Because I didn't cause these problems, Ms. Knope."
Ben Wyatt,Your government did.
Ben Wyatt,I'll get what I need from the spreadsheets.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?
Tom Haverford,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Looking hot, Big T."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Throw them bows-- What?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Damn, girl, who are you trying to impress?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Just kidding.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I know.
April Ludgate,Walk away.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yep, you got it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Donna.
Donna Meagle,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,Got you a birthday shot.
April Ludgate,"Thanks, but now that it's legal, I've kind of lost interest."
Donna Meagle,Suit yourself.
Ann Perkins,I guess our awesome new park is on hold.
Ann Perkins,You have any idea what they're going to cut?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Ann Perkins,You know what? You shouldn't wait around.
Ann Perkins,You should come up with your own budget plan and just control your own destiny.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I just don't know if I can play God like that-- an angry vengeful God who just fires Jerry for no reason."
Ann Perkins,You'd fire Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Not necessarily.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,It's just been a really crappy day.
Leslie Knope,Where were you earlier when I called?
Ann Perkins,Talking to Mark.
Leslie Knope,Again?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,It has been a rough week.
Leslie Knope,You want to get super drunk?
Ann Perkins,I really do.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Where's our lady?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Tom Haverford,I hope you all know I was instrumental in getting Trish crowned Miss Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,What was your talent again?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,Looking amazing.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, ladies, is there anything you desire at all, besides me?"
Trish Ianetta,So funny.
Trish Ianetta,You are so funny!
Tom Haverford,"I'm serious, though."
Tom Haverford,Are you into me?
Trish Ianetta,What?
Leslie Knope,"Chug that, bitch!"
Ann Perkins,Rules are rules.
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, listen to me. Listen to me, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I know I had a master plan, and it all blew up in my face, but you… You came into a town hall meeting, and we met, and we became friends, and that is awesome."
Ann Perkins,It is so awesome. You are so awesome. I love you.
Leslie Knope,"I love you too, but I need more beer."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I'm gonna get you more beer."
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Best friends of ever.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, April."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.
Andy Dwyer,Let me see you.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Give me a twirl.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,This is beautiful.
April Ludgate,Don't look at me.
April Ludgate,"No, look at me."
Andy Dwyer,Happy birthday.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Can I get you a drink?
Andy Dwyer,Or wait.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I can swing it."
Andy Dwyer,Can I get you a drink?
April Ludgate,Whiskey.
April Ludgate,Neat.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,You're not messing around.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I'm not.
Andy Dwyer,Barkeep.
Ann Perkins,Andy Dwyer!
Ann Perkins,It's so awesome to see you.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you, too."
Andy Dwyer,How are you?
Ann Perkins,Let me ask you a question.
Ann Perkins,Was I a good girlfriend?
Andy Dwyer,"Ann, you were an awesome girlfriend."
Ann Perkins,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Aw!
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I was the screw-up."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you were."
Ann Perkins,"We had a good relationship, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"God, I think so."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, we fought a lot."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I know that.
Ann Perkins,Let me ask you something.
Ann Perkins,I'm hot.
Andy Dwyer,Is that a question?
Ann Perkins,When we were together-- I can't see you.
Ann Perkins,When we were together.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Were there times that you were like, ""If I don't see Ann in, like, 10 seconds, I'm gonna die""?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, all the time."
Ann Perkins,I loved Andy.
Ann Perkins,Loved him.
Ann Perkins,Loved Andy.
Ann Perkins,He was a totally helpless baby when we met.
Ann Perkins,I dated him for three years.
Ann Perkins,"Now, he's an adult with a job."
Ann Perkins,And some other girl is going to reap the rewards of my hard work?
Ann Perkins,That's bull [bleep].
Tom Haverford,"And I'm reading this, and I'm like, ""How could they hurt those gorillas like that?"""
Tom Haverford,"They're such gentle, magnificent creatures, you know?"
Tom Haverford,I'm an animal lover.
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I want you to keep this bottle cap."
Tom Haverford,So you always remember me and the first time we met.
Tom Haverford,Classic game.
Tom Haverford,Plant the seed.
Tom Haverford,"Harvest, like, a half hour later."
Andy Dwyer,Here you go.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry that took forever.
Andy Dwyer,God.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hey, baby, you miss me?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Because I missed you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, look at this."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Andy.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Andy.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's an all right name.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's an all right name.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Are you guys-- Are you guys hanging out together?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, maybe."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yep.
April Ludgate,"You know, he asked me out so many times."
April Ludgate,I guess he wore me down.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm very persistent.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come over here.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come over here.
Andy Dwyer,I can hear you.
Andy Dwyer,I can hear you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Come on.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"One time, I waited outside a woman's house for five days just to show her how serious I was about wanting to drill her."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Turns out it was the wrong house.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"She loved the story, anyway."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We got to third base.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Over the pants.
April Ludgate,That's so cute.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yeah, super cute."
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Right?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you want a Remy Martin?
Andy Dwyer,Probably good.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, I'll get you one."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Two Remy Martins!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Here we go!
Andy Dwyer,You can have my Remy Martin for your birthday.
Andy Dwyer,I thought she liked me.
Andy Dwyer,I guess I'm super bad at picking up signals.
Andy Dwyer,That Ralph Macchio guy is a total douche.
Tom Haverford,Did I give you a bottle cap?
Tom Haverford,"Excuse me, did I give you a bottle cap?"
Extra,What?
Tom Haverford,Did I give any of you guys a bottle cap?
Tom Haverford,You sure?
Tom Haverford,Who the [bleep] did I give a bottle cap to?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This party sucks.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let's get out of here.
April Ludgate,It's my birthday party.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It is?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm sorry, boo."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm not saying we're the best band in the universe, but we are, I would say, honestly, the best band in the world."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I should write an article about you-- another article about you.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, okay. Hey, can I buy you a drink?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah? Do you have a tab I could put it on?
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, how old are you?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,25
Andy Dwyer,"Mark! Brendanawicz, hey. What's 25 divided by 2 plus 7?"
Mark Brendanawicz,19 and a half.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'm older than that."
Andy Dwyer,We're good to go.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, this is my dear friend, Mark Brendanawicz."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, we actually, uh, met."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, duh! Yeah, you guys totally slept together."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll take that drink.
Mark Brendanawicz,So you're with Andy now?
Mark Brendanawicz,"No, that makes sense."
Mark Brendanawicz,It's been a great week.
Leslie Knope,You know what's thirsty?
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,You know what's weird?
Leslie Knope,How thirsty I get when I'm weird.
Leslie Knope,When I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, the jerk, is here."
Ann Perkins,Who are?
Leslie Knope,That one.
Leslie Knope,The one coming over here.
Leslie Knope,Get ready.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie, be professional."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot."
Ben Wyatt,So I just wanted to stop by and--
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, save your breath."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Just get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Because this is a party with my friends, and you're trying to fire all my friends."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I just talked to everybody in this bar, and nobody wants you here."
Ben Wyatt,That must have taken awhile.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it did. You're a cold, callous person, and you want to kill people with machetes."
Leslie Knope,"And Ann is right, I should make my own plan, so that you can't hurt us, and that's what I'm gonna do."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Then I'll just see you tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry to bother you.
Leslie Knope,Get out of here.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,That was so professional.
Ann Perkins,I'm so proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,You have to help me.
Leslie Knope,Ow.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,But you have to help me.
Ann Perkins,I think I may have made out with someone last night.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Who?
Ann Perkins,I don't remember.
Ann Perkins,I don't even know if it happened.
Ann Perkins,I just had this feeling when I woke up this morning like I definitely kissed somebody.
Leslie Knope,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Ann."
Jerry Gergich,"Wow, that was a crazy night last night."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, crazy."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, I left at 11:15, and you were still raging pretty hard."
Ann Perkins,I was.
Ann Perkins,I was.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,So it's not Jerry.
Ann Perkins,Help me.
Leslie Knope,I'll keep an ear to the ground.
Ron Swanson,Knope! My office.
Ann Perkins,That's loud.
Leslie Knope,Why the yelling?
Ron Swanson,Have a good night last night?
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Ron Swanson,Did you enjoy your second loud conversation with Ben?
Ron Swanson,The state auditor who holds your very fate in his hands like a tiny bird.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, he deserves it."
Leslie Knope,"He's cold and unfeeling, and I yelled at him. So what?"
Ron Swanson,"Believe me, I want this government cut to the bone. But I can't have you getting yourself fired, because then I'll have to acutally do stuff."
Ron Swanson,Go apologize.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't have anything to apologize for."
Leslie Knope,"All I did was express myself, forcefully, drunkenly. And I spit on him a little bit."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll go apologize."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Welcome, welcome, welcome."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You have a lot of bottles there.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Would you like a vitamin?
Chris Traeger,B12?
Chris Traeger,Evening primrose oil?
Chris Traeger,Willow bark?
Chris Traeger,Magnesium?
Leslie Knope,"No, thank you."
Chris Traeger,You sure?
Chris Traeger,Really good for hangovers.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'll take one."
Chris Traeger,I take care of my body above all else.
Chris Traeger,"Diet, exercise, supplements, and positive thinking."
Chris Traeger,Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
Chris Traeger,I believe I am that human being.
Chris Traeger,So what brings you here so early?
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to speak to Ben, actually."
Chris Traeger,Great.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna listen to some ocean sounds and do some chin-ups.
Leslie Knope,So I'd like to apologize for yesterday.
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I did was out of line."
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Leslie Knope,"And I was worked up, because obviously, you represent a threat to my department."
Ben Wyatt,Your City Council and your Mayor are the threats to your department.
Ben Wyatt,"We didn't do anything to get you into this situation, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Look, Ben, I don't appreciate your callous attitude, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, really."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You may hold my fate in your hands like a small bird, but I still think you're an ass."
Ben Wyatt,You want to get a beer?
Leslie Knope,It's like 10:30 in the morning.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,And you seem like you could use a beer.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get a beer.
Leslie Knope,Well…
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh."
Chris Traeger,Don't keep him too long.
Chris Traeger,I need someone to be here when I take my multivitamin.
Chris Traeger,There's a choking hazard.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, can we go?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"You don't remember anything that happened last night, do you?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"For once, it's Ann who blacked out drunk and not Andy."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,That's really dangerous.
Ann Perkins,Please tell me.
Andy Dwyer,This is going to be so fun letting you dangle until I finally reveal that we did not make out.
Andy Dwyer,Oh [bleep].
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,See you.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Tom Haverford," Hey, I need to settle my bill from last night."
Tom Haverford, Tom Haverford.
Lucy, Okay.
Lucy, Wow.
Lucy," You had 47 drinks last night? Ten cosmos, eight Smirnoff Ices, and everything else starts with the word pomegranate."
Lucy, Was it your bachelorette party?
Tom Haverford,"No, I invited a bunch of girls here last night, and they all put drinks on my tab."
Tom Haverford, And then I went home alone.
Tom Haverford, I'm not sure what happened.
Lucy," You invited a bunch of girls here, and then you tried to hit on all of them."
Tom Haverford, Fair enough.
Lucy," I mean, what were you expecting was gonna happen, a 43-way?"
Tom Haverford,That would have been a little out of control.
Lucy, But awesome.
Tom Haverford," Yeah, the problem is I only have 15 penises, so There would have been 28 girls that were really upset with me."
Lucy, Yeah.
Tom Haverford," All right, well, thanks."
Tom Haverford," Hey, would you wanna get a drink tomorrow night?"
Lucy,Does it have to be here?
Tom Haverford,No.
Lucy," Then, sure."
Lucy, I'm Lucy.
Lucy, Let me give you my phone number.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, I don't know what you were thinking."
Andy Dwyer,Just now? Nothing.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, I had a great time last night."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So are you free this weekend?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Shauna, look, I think you are a super cute person, and your newspaper articles are so cool, and they're probably very accurate."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't think we should go out romantically.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Why not?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, honestly, because there's already a girl that I like."
Andy Dwyer,And we kind of have a long backstory of history.
Andy Dwyer,And… I like her.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, well, good luck."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I can't even land the shoeshine guy.
Leslie Knope," Wow, that tastes really good."
Ben Wyatt, How's your head?
Leslie Knope,Mushy.
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
Leslie Knope, All three times.
Leslie Knope, But I don't think you know anything about my department.
Leslie Knope, Have you ever been part of a government body before?
Ben Wyatt,"I have, yeah."
Ben Wyatt," Small town called Partridge, Minnesota."
Leslie Knope, Why does that sound familiar? You're Benji Wyatt?
Ben Wyatt,I am.
Ben Wyatt," When I was 18, I ran for mayor of my small town."
Ben Wyatt, And won.
Ben Wyatt," A little bit of anti-establishment voter rebellion, I guess."
Ben Wyatt," Here's the thing, though, about 18 year olds."
Ben Wyatt, They're idiots.
Ben Wyatt, So I pretty much ran the place into the ground after two months and got impeached.
Ben Wyatt, The worst part was my parents grounded me.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, You were so cute.
Ben Wyatt," Well, thank you."
Leslie Knope, What was that song you played at the swearing-in ceremony?
Ben Wyatt,Whoomp! There it is.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Ben Wyatt, That's what it was.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," God, I was so jealous of you."
Ben Wyatt, You shouldn't have been.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, it ended up kind of ruining my life."
Ben Wyatt," And now, I'm balancing budgets so I can show people I'm responsible."
Ben Wyatt," So I can run for office again someday and not be laughed at, you know."
Ben Wyatt," I mean, you want to run for office someday, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, How did you know?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you have to be able to make decisions like this, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt," You have to be harsh, you know? No one's going to elect you to do anything if you don't show that you're a responsible grown-up."
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt," Please, Mr.  Mayor, let me."
Ben Wyatt, Whoomp there it is.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
April Ludgate, Mmm.
April Ludgate, Mmm.
Ron Swanson, Everything okay?
April Ludgate,Hmm? Mmm.
April Ludgate, No.
Leslie Knope, You ready?
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ann Perkins," Hey, Ron, did we make out last night?"
Ron Swanson,"Good God, woman."
Ron Swanson, No.
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Ann Perkins," Well, that's it."
Ann Perkins, That's all the men that I know.
Chris Traeger, You guys just knocked it completely out of the park.
Chris Traeger," And I appreciate it, and we will see you later."
Chris Traeger," Hey, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins, Hey.
Chris Traeger," Hey, well--"
Chris Traeger,April's party? April's party?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford," Hey, man."
Tom Haverford, How's it going?
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Chris Traeger, Hey.
Tom Haverford," Yeah, Tom."
Chris Traeger, Hey.
Ann Perkins, Come here.
Ann Perkins," There's no reason not to love him, but I didn't."
Ann Perkins, Highway to the Danger Zone.
Chris Traeger,I've called you a cab.
Ann Perkins," You know, I just--"
Chris Traeger,"Okay, let's get you in the cab."
Chris Traeger, Come on.
Ann Perkins, Boo.
Chris Traeger, Fancy this.
Chris Traeger," Listen, I have meetings all day, but I'd love to chat with you."
Chris Traeger, Can I call you?
Ann Perkins,You have my phone number?
Chris Traeger,"No, you couldn't remember your phone number, but you gave me your phone."
Ann Perkins, Terrific.
Ann Perkins, That's great.
Ann Perkins, We'll talk later.
Chris Traeger, Okay.
Chris Traeger, Danger zone.
Chris Traeger,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope, We'll talk later.
Leslie Knope,We should have a meeting to about things that happened in secret.
Leslie Knope, This suggested plan reduces our overall budget by 35%.
Leslie Knope," And it contains very practical, deep cuts in many of our services."
Chris Traeger," Wow, Leslie."
Chris Traeger, This is amazing.
Chris Traeger, But it's moot.
Leslie Knope, Why?
Chris Traeger,Our investigation has revealed that things in Pawnee are much worse than we anticipated.
Leslie Knope, Meaning what?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice."
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope, I just started hearing really loud circus music in my head.
Leslie Knope, What did you say?
Andy Dwyer,"November, you're beautiful, November, you're so serene, walk among the clouds, and see that you and me, were meant to be,"
Andy Dwyer,"November, your bangs are cute, November, your voice is a flute, November, let's pretend the sky is for us, Let's spread our wings and fly on a date, I want to go on a date with you, November."
Andy Dwyer,That song is about April.

Andy Dwyer,Ron!
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,It's quiet in here.
Andy Dwyer,Where is everyone?
Ron Swanson,The government is shut down.
Ron Swanson,It's in every newspaper.
Andy Dwyer,How long is it going to last?
Ron Swanson,"Well, if we're lucky, this building will be empty for months."
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,That is really bad timing.
Andy Dwyer,I just got this super sweet-ass rad crotch rocket.
Andy Dwyer,I've always wanted one of these.
Andy Dwyer,"But due to, you know, never having a job, I couldn't afford it until now."
Andy Dwyer,Got a really good deal on my lease.
Andy Dwyer,Paying 12% interest.
Andy Dwyer,"It's, like, one of the highest you can get."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, so I've been trying like crazy to get a hold of April."
Andy Dwyer,"If you see her, will you tell her I really need to talk to her?"
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Uh-oh!
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,All I can tell you is that all the parks are closed until further notice.
Leslie Knope,"Look, no one is more upset about this than I am."
Leslie Knope,Not like it's a competition or anything.
Leslie Knope,"Because if it was, I would win."
Leslie Knope,But that's neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope,The point is I would win.
Extra,How long will they be closed?
Ron Swanson,Could be forever.
Extra,"With the government shut down, who is going to stop Al Qaeda?"
Leslie Knope,One thing at a time.
Extra,School is out in two weeks.
Extra,What am I going to do with my kids all day?
Extra,Keep them in my house?
Extra,Where I live?
Leslie Knope,I don't know what to tell you.
Extra,What about the kids' concert tomorrow at Ramsett Park?
Extra,The Freddy Spaghetti concert.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti has been canceled.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hope you're happy."
Ron Swanson,I am. I am extremely happy because I don't think we should be wasting taxpayer money.
Leslie Knope,It's not a waste to provide fun for kids.
Leslie Knope,And I for one do not like having Freddy Spaghetti's blood on my hands.
Ron Swanson,I believe you mean Freddy Spaghetti's sauce.
Ron Swanson,I burned my tongue. Don't even care.
Chris Traeger,You see this color? I don't like it. It's too depressing.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope. One second. I'd like some water.
Chris Traeger,"I'd like it to be cold, I'd like it without ice, I'd like it in a glass or a mug with no handle."
Chris Traeger,How can I help you?
Leslie Knope," Well, I believe there has been a casualty of war in this government shutdown, and it saddens me."
Leslie Knope,And it is Pawnee's children.
Chris Traeger,"Well, sit down and tell me exactly what has happened."
Leslie Knope,"Every year, we kick off the summer with a children's concert series."
Leslie Knope,"And this year, the concert has been canceled due to the shutdown."
Chris Traeger,"It's terrible, and we need to fix it."
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very glad that you agree with me, but I actually worked really hard on my argument."
Leslie Knope,Is there any way I can still kind of... Yeah?
Chris Traeger,I'd love to hear it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,You're wrong.
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,Can you put a price tag on a child's smile?
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,What a surprise.
Ben Wyatt,"The government has been shut for two days, and one city employee has tried to schedule 14 meetings with me."
Ben Wyatt,Can you guess who?
Chris Traeger,Ben?
Chris Traeger,There was a big concert.
Chris Traeger,"Now, there's not."
Chris Traeger,Isn't there anything that we can do about that?
Ben Wyatt,"No, there isn't."
Chris Traeger,That's too bad.
Chris Traeger,"Sorry, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Chris Traeger,I have to go run 10 miles.
Chris Traeger,I have run 10 miles a day every day for 18 years.
Chris Traeger,"That's 65,000 miles."
Chris Traeger,A third of the way to the moon.
Chris Traeger,My goal is to run to the moon.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's talk solutions."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, Pawnee is broke."
Ben Wyatt,There's no money for a concert.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, Idaho cut their Parks Department by 80%, and Idaho is basically one giant park."
Leslie Knope,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is better than Idaho.
Ben Wyatt,"No, Pawnee is not special."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Your department, all the way down here, is not a priority."
Ben Wyatt,"And frankly, you're not even supposed to be in the building, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,You're non-essential.
Leslie Knope,That is not your call.
Ben Wyatt,"I know, it's on your badge."
Leslie Knope,This?
Leslie Knope,This isn't me.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Chris something.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,"I was just doing my daily lunch time 10 miles and I ran by the hospital, and I thought I'd pop up and say hi."
Ann Perkins,Did you just start your run?
Chris Traeger,"No, I'm already at mile nine."
Ann Perkins,But you're not sweating at all.
Chris Traeger,I know.
Chris Traeger,I have a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute.
Chris Traeger,The scientist who studied me said that my heart could pump jet fuel up into an airplane.
Chris Traeger,I'd love to go out on a date with you.
Chris Traeger,I think you might find me attractive because you got drunk and kissed me when we first met.
Chris Traeger,"And no pressure, but I do have tonight open."
Ann Perkins,I am so sorry.
Ann Perkins,I'm really busy right now.
Chris Traeger,No problem.
Chris Traeger,I will try again soon.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Extra,"That's the guy who likes you, that you're not into."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Extra,And which part of him are you not looking at?
Ann Perkins,"Traditionally, when I end a long-term relationship, I'm a little fragile, and I have a tendency to do some reckless things."
Ann Perkins,So I need to stay away from Chris.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this government shutdown.
Leslie Knope,I can't stand this budget crisis.
Leslie Knope,But what I can't stand is they're canceling Freddy Spaghetti.
Leslie Knope,You know everything.
Leslie Knope,What should I do about this?
Mark Brendanawicz,"I don't know, Leslie."
Mark Brendanawicz,Why don't you see a movie or go shopping?
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, they offered me a buyout, and I took it."
Mark Brendanawicz,"And so now, I work for Norton Construction."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I know I shouldn't have done that.
Mark Brendanawicz,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,How could you quit?
Mark Brendanawicz,"You know, not everyone has your enthusiasm for this work."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I guess I've been mispronouncing your name all these years."
Leslie Knope,Mark Brendanaquitz.
Mark Brendanawicz,"Recently, I had been thinking about maybe leaving this job."
Mark Brendanawicz,But I felt like I needed a sign.
Mark Brendanawicz,"And then Ann broke up with me the week that I was going to propose, the government got shut down, and yesterday one of those pigeons took a [bleep] on me."
Mark Brendanawicz,And I was indoors.
Mark Brendanawicz,So…
Tom Haverford,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, sorry."
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Leslie Knope,Is this a bad time?
Tom Haverford,Lucy is here.
Tom Haverford,I'm in my sexy pajamas.
Tom Haverford,I just took four Benadryls to dull my sensitivity.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, it is a bad time."
Leslie Knope,You're about to have sex.
Tom Haverford,Why else would Boyz II Men's On Bended Knee be playing right now?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I just want to give you a little advice, which is don't make it last really long."
Leslie Knope,Ladies don't like that.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Just one more thing.
Leslie Knope,Are you using protection?
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,I'm just going to stay away from all guys right now.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Less man time, more Ann time."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Everyone needs a friend they can call and wake up in the middle of the night. Leslie's usually already up.
Ann Perkins,"And often, she's already on her way over."
Leslie Knope,"The only guy that I care about right now is six feet tall with wild, crazy hair and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun."
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.
Leslie Knope,You know what is?
Leslie Knope,Sewage.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee's kids are less important than poop tubes.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what are you going to do?"
Leslie Knope,That's the way it is.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Ann Perkins,"If all the parks are closed, why not just have the concert in the lot behind my house?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you devious bastard."
Freddy Spaghetti,"Well, the cow goes ""moo"" and the pig goes ""oink"""
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've spent the last three hours coming up with a plan."
Leslie Knope,And I sent up the Bat Signal for all the people in the Parks Department to come and join us.
Leslie Knope,I told them to be here by 8:00.
Ann Perkins,Do you think anybody is going to show up?
Leslie Knope,"A, yes."
Leslie Knope,"B, even if they don't, we'll just put the concert on ourselves."
Leslie Knope,"But C, yes."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, they're definitely going to show up."
Leslie Knope,"Although, D, maybe not."
Ann Perkins,I think that you need to prepare for the eventuality that no one--
Jerry Gergich,Hello?
Jerry Gergich,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"God bless you, Jerry Gergich!"
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,I never thought I'd hear those words from you.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Leslie Knope,April is here.
Leslie Knope,"Move, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,I didn't think you were going to help.
April Ludgate,I still might not.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, how do you feel about lifting heavy things?"
Jerry Gergich,My doctor just said I should avoid--
Leslie Knope,Being a wuss?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I agree."
Leslie Knope,"So, go out there and get the equipment out of the truck."
Leslie Knope,You're here.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Leslie Knope,Can you make us some more pancakes?
April Ludgate,"Yes, Ann, I want pancakes."
Ann Perkins,"Uh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"With current and projected deficits, we need to cut expenditures by 32%."
Ron Swanson,Let's make it an even 40.
Ben Wyatt,That's not necessary.
Ron Swanson,Slash it.
Ron Swanson,Slash it.
Florence,"Ron, a lot of people are going to get fired. Do you mind trying not to gloat?"
Florence,"Yes, I do, Florence. I do mind that."
Ron Swanson,I'm very excited about this. I made pennants.
Ron Swanson,I am an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget.
Ron Swanson,Just saying that gave me a semi.
Ron Swanson,"Right off the bat, we sell City Hall."
Ron Swanson,Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a T.J. Maxx.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, that is a very creative idea."
Chris Traeger,"But we don't want to sell any of our major assets, because we don't want to lose out on any future revenue streams."
Ron Swanson,I hear that.
Ron Swanson,Don't worry.
Ron Swanson,I have tons more ideas.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, uh--"
Ron Swanson,So sorry.
Ron Swanson,New ring tone.
Ron Swanson,Don't cut anything without me.
Ron Swanson,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,I don't care if you hate what we do.
Leslie Knope,I love it enough for both of us.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put on the Freddy Spaghetti concert today, 5:00 on Lot 48."
Ron Swanson,You can't do that.
Leslie Knope,Watch me.
Leslie Knope,"We're going to do this, Ron."
Leslie Knope,With or without you.
Leslie Knope,Hammering away.
Leslie Knope,Crank it.
Leslie Knope,Hit it.
Leslie Knope,Needs 16 minutes for premium bounce.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, after this, can you go pick up Freddy Spaghetti in your Mercedes?"
Leslie Knope,We need to give him the star treatment.
Donna Meagle,He'd better be showered.
Donna Meagle,"I just detailed my car, and he is notoriously funky."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Sorry we're late.
Tom Haverford,I had to wait on my girlfriend to finish eating breakfast.
Lucy,Hi.
Lucy,I'm Lucy.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Lucy,Hey.
Tom Haverford,We had dinner last night and breakfast this morning.
Tom Haverford,What were we doing in between?
Tom Haverford,Sex stuff.
Lucy,"You guys know Tom really well, so I don't have to apologize for his behavior, right?"
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"We're so glad you're here, thanks for coming."
Lucy,"Thanks, it's gonna be fun."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna put on a show today.
Leslie Knope,And it's not gonna make all the problems in our town go away.
Leslie Knope,But it is gonna make a lot of people happy.
Leslie Knope,Everybody ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
All,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"All right, so-- Oh I forgot."
Leslie Knope,I didn't get a chance to get porta-potties so the audience are gonna have to use Ann's house for the bathrooms.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, aren't we expecting like 300 people?"
Leslie Knope,"Hopefully! Okay, back to work!"
Andy Dwyer,"The craziest thing is it's, like, super loud."
Andy Dwyer,You know what I mean?
Andy Dwyer,"I was on it for only five minutes, and I can't really hear anything."
Andy Dwyer,Am I talking loud right now?
Lucy,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,And you know how to ride a motorcycle?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's just like driving half a car."
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer,I called you a gajillion times.
Andy Dwyer,Why didn't you call me back?
April Ludgate,I'm so sorry.
April Ludgate,I was too busy not wanting to talk to you.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
April Ludgate,"Jerry, what are you doing?"
Jerry Gergich,Leslie asked me to post these around the neighborhood.
April Ludgate,I'll do it.
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,You want some help with that?
Tom Haverford,"So, I heard about you and Chris."
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Ann Perkins,Nothing's gonna happen there.
Tom Haverford,Why not? You're a free agent.
Tom Haverford,Unlike me.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I make some bad decisions sometimes at the end of long relationships."
Ann Perkins,I think I'm just gonna cool it for a while.
Tom Haverford,That makes sense.
Tom Haverford,You don't need to jump into anything.
Tom Haverford,A girl like you can have whatever guy she wants.
Ann Perkins,Shut up.
Tom Haverford,"I'm serious Ann. I might joke about how nice your booty is, but I think you're a really nice person, and I think any guy would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend."
Ann Perkins,Listen to you. I like Tom with a girlfriend.
Ann Perkins,He's really sweet.
Tom Haverford,How much do you like him? Because I could definitely talk to Lucy about a three way situation.
Ann Perkins,Unbelievable.
Tom Haverford,I'm kidding.
Tom Haverford,But serious at the same time.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's talk about Parks and Rec."
Ben Wyatt,This one is a little complicated.
Chris Traeger,I know what will loosen up our brains.
Chris Traeger,Massage train.
Chris Traeger,And I know what you're thinking.
Chris Traeger,It's not that I want a massage.
Chris Traeger,I'll be the caboose.
Chris Traeger,And Ron Swanson is the locomotive.
Ben Wyatt,"And thanks to Ron, the services budget has already been cut significantly."
Ben Wyatt,"So, seems like the best option is job cuts."
Ben Wyatt,Starting with Leslie Knope.
Ron Swanson,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,"If you fire Leslie, you might as well just get rid of the department."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know how valuable she is, believe me."
Ben Wyatt,But we've run out of options.
Ron Swanson,There are plenty of other options.
Ron Swanson,"For example, sell the zoo animals."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,To whom?
Ron Swanson,Cosmetics labs?
Ron Swanson,Weird restaurants?
Ron Swanson,I'm just spitballing here.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, let's switch it up."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, she makes the second highest salary in the department."
Ben Wyatt,It will go a long way.
Ron Swanson,I'm telling you.
Ron Swanson,It's just not an option.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, focus up, buddy."
Ron Swanson,Just give me a sec.
Andy Dwyer,Will you just stop and listen to me?
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't want to talk to you, anyways."
Andy Dwyer,Reverse psychiatry.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,I like you.
Andy Dwyer,"In a, you know, romantical kind of way."
April Ludgate,You do?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Do you like me?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"So, then perhaps, shall we go out this evening?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I don't think we should see each other.
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,Because you're 21 and I'm 29?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I don't care about that.
April Ludgate,"It's because whenever I see you talk to Ann or talk about Ann, I feel like you still have feelings for her."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I don't."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't.
Andy Dwyer,"Really, I don't."
April Ludgate,"Well, I think you do."
April Ludgate,So... That's a problem for me.
Ron Swanson,"Because of my libertarian beliefs, Leslie does 95% of the work."
Ron Swanson,So you should lay me off.
Ron Swanson,I'd be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war.
Ben Wyatt,It's precisely because of your beliefs that we need to keep you.
Ben Wyatt,You would maintain fiscal responsibility after we're gone.
Ron Swanson,I strenuously object.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Ron, we're moving on."
Ben Wyatt,Every department is losing a Leslie Knope.
Ron Swanson,"No, Ben, they are not."
Ron Swanson,No other department has one to begin with.
Ron Swanson,"Right now, she's singlehandedly putting up some lousy concert for this city's kids."
Ben Wyatt,She's doing what?
Chris Traeger,Could someone else massage my shoulders?
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Looking good.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish we had built one of those elevators that comes up from under the stage, you know?"
Ron Swanson,They're coming!
Ann Perkins,Like a rock arena kind of thing?
Ron Swanson,They're coming!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ron Swanson,They're coming.
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Leslie Knope,What?
Andy Dwyer,Who?
Andy Dwyer,The Russians?
Ron Swanson,"No, the state auditors."
Ron Swanson,I accidentally told them what you were doing in an attempt to save some government jobs.
Ron Swanson,It's been a very strange day for me.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, be cool."
Leslie Knope,Just be cool.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,All right.
Chris Traeger,Everybody!
Chris Traeger,Everybody!
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Everyone.
Chris Traeger,You are all super amazing.
Chris Traeger,"You are what makes Pawnee great, and I just want to tell you that I am totally supportive of your inspiring efforts here today!"
Chris Traeger,"Now, my partner Ben wants to say something."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, we're shutting this down."
Jerry Gergich,What?
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Chris Traeger,That's terrible news!
Chris Traeger,"Surely, there has to be a solution, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Chris Traeger,Ben says no.
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, everyone."
Ben Wyatt,Chris and I used to slash budgets individually.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, when he would do it by himself, nothing got done, and when I did it by myself, I'd get death threats."
Ben Wyatt,"Together, it seems to work."
Ben Wyatt,"The concert is canceled, everybody."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Here's the thing, though, Ben."
Leslie Knope,It's not canceled.
Leslie Knope,We're putting it on.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Because the stage is already built.
Leslie Knope,Everything was donated for free by local vendors.
Leslie Knope,Everyone here believes that what we're doing is essential.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti will sing.
Donna Meagle,"Actually, Leslie, I just found out."
Donna Meagle,Freddy Spaghetti ain't coming.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.
Leslie Knope,But something much cooler is going to happen.
Leslie Knope,I think.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Good job.
Chris Traeger,You should hydrate.
Donna Meagle,"When we canceled on him, he took another gig in Eagleton."
Donna Meagle,At a library.
Tom Haverford,That's literally the worst place I can imagine.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Guys?
Leslie Knope,We're not giving up on this.
Leslie Knope,He's not the only musician in town.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I don't really feel like playing right now.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, please."
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Andy Dwyer,I don't even have children's songs.
Andy Dwyer,My last song I wrote was called Sex Hair.
Leslie Knope,"Well, just take the word ""sex"" and change it to ""pickle."""
Andy Dwyer,Pickle?
Andy Dwyer,"You got pickle hair, baby, And you got it from me"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Still sounds like it's about sex.
Andy Dwyer,I'm in.
Andy Dwyer,I've got to grab my guitar from my house.
Andy Dwyer,I'll be back shortly!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"See, guys?"
Leslie Knope,We have a solution.
Leslie Knope,"And the good news is there's always a solution if your motives are pure, and your cause is just."
Leslie Knope,There's nothing--
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Andy Dwyer,My arm!
Ann Perkins,"You have two broken bones in your right arm, and four in your hand."
Andy Dwyer,That's the side that hurts.
Leslie Knope,How soon until he's better?
Dr. Harris,"We'll set the fractures, and I'd like to keep him overnight for observation."
Andy Dwyer,Is there any chance you can fix me in the next 10 minutes?
Dr. Harris,"Sure, I'll just advance medical science 30 years."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Leslie Knope,Can Mouse Rat play without you?
Andy Dwyer,They tried once.
Andy Dwyer,"They're called Rat Mouse, and they're awful."
Andy Dwyer,But you have got to find somebody.
Andy Dwyer,There's an old saying in show business.
Andy Dwyer,"""The show must go wrong."""
Andy Dwyer,"Everything always goes wrong, and you just have to deal with it."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,I'm Renata Ricotta.
Leslie Knope,Freddy Spaghetti couldn't make it today.
Leslie Knope,He bumped his noodle.
Leslie Knope,There was sauce everywhere.
Leslie Knope,It was just streaming out of his face.
Leslie Knope,It was really scary.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"If you're happy and you know it, Clap your hands, If you're happy and you know it…"
Freddy Spaghetti,Clap your hands
Freddy Spaghetti,"Hey, kids!"
Freddy Spaghetti,"It's me, Freddy Spaghetti!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I thought you were playing in Eagleton."
Freddy Spaghetti,All I know is this guy showed up and made me a much better offer.
Freddy Spaghetti,"I am all about the money, babe."
Freddy Spaghetti,"She cooked an itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot linguine, That she made for the first time that day"
Ron Swanson,Thank you very much.
Tom Haverford,Ron Corleone.
Tom Haverford,"This really attractive woman is my girlfriend, Lucy."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Lucy."
Ron Swanson,Whoa!
Lucy,Hi.
Ron Swanson,Impressive handshake.
Lucy,Thanks.
Lucy,My father told me that a limp handshake was for weak men and Communists.
Lucy,He hated both.
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Tommy."
Tom Haverford,Is that bacon on your turkey leg?
Ron Swanson,They call it a Swanson.
Lucy,Wow.
Ron Swanson,Freddy Spaghetti.
Lucy,That guy rules.
Ann Perkins,I brought you your favorite.
Ann Perkins,Every color of Jell-O.
Andy Dwyer,The Jell-O rainbow.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Is something wrong?
Andy Dwyer,"Okh, okay, you know when you're just already having a bad day, and then you break all the bones in your arm because you crash your motorcycle?"
Ann Perkins,"Dude, that's what my whole week has been like."
Ann Perkins,My life is a motorcycle crash right now.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no."
Ann Perkins,Injured Andy.
Ann Perkins,"It's kind of like old times, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Ann Perkins, I almost expect you to call me A-Cakes.
Andy Dwyer, A- Cakes.
Ann Perkins," Well, I'm glad you're okay."
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins, I'm... I'm so sorry.
Ann Perkins, I should not... I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins, That was not…
Freddy Spaghetti,Spaghetti.
Kids, Spaghetti.
Freddy Spaghetti, Fusilli.
Kids, Fusilli.
Freddy Spaghetti, Egg noodles.
Kids, Egg noodles.
Leslie Knope, Why did you do this?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm not a monster."
Ben Wyatt, I want the kids to have their concert.
Leslie Knope, Mean Ben has a soft spot.
Ben Wyatt, Is that what you guys call me?
Leslie Knope," No. No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt, Mean Ben?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this is really great today, but there's going to be a lot of pain ahead, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt, We have to cut 32% of the--
Leslie Knope," Just... Can you just stop it? Okay? Just for one moment, enjoy the fact that you provided a service for people, not a cut."
Leslie Knope, A service.
Leslie Knope, And they love it.
Freddy Spaghetti, Macaroni.
Kids, Macaroni.
Ben Wyatt, The biggest service was getting you to stop singing.
Freddy Spaghetti, Linguine.
Kids,Linguine.
Freddy Spaghetti, Tetrazzini.
Kids, Tetrazzini.
Lucy, Hey.
Lucy,You wanna go to Ann's house?
Tom Haverford,Seriously?
Lucy,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Move!
Lucy,Excuse me.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Andy Dwyer, April.
April Ludgate, I just heard.
April Ludgate, Are you okay?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate," Oh, my God."
April Ludgate," Listen, what I said this afternoon was stupid."
April Ludgate, Okay? I totally want to go out with you.
Andy Dwyer, Good.
Andy Dwyer, I want to be with you.
April Ludgate, That was nice.
Andy Dwyer, That-- Yeah.
Andy Dwyer," Here's just one thing, real quick."
Andy Dwyer," I want to be totally honest with you, because I like you so much."
April Ludgate, Okay.
Andy Dwyer," But, like, two minutes ago, me and Ann did kiss."
April Ludgate, What?
Andy Dwyer,"But here's... No, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer, It was crazy.
Andy Dwyer, She kissed me.
April Ludgate," Okay, bye."
Andy Dwyer," Wait, where are you going?"
April Ludgate,Bye.
Andy Dwyer," No, no, no, no, no! Hey!"
April Ludgate,Bye.
Andy Dwyer, April.
Andy Dwyer, April!
April Ludgate,Bye!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, don't even think about kissing me."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Tom Haverford. Who's your friend?
Lucy,Ah! What the hell?
Tom Haverford,"Get out of here, dude!"
Chris Traeger,"You got it, Tom."
Leslie Knope," And what was your favorite song, Chelsea?"
Chelsea,Penne and the Jets.
Leslie Knope," Me, too!"
Extra,Thank you all so much.
Extra," With all the parks closed, we've been going crazy."
Extra, It's our pleasure.
Extra, Come on.
Leslie Knope," You guys are the best, most important people in the most important government in the best city in the world."
Tom Haverford," Suck it, Paris, France."
Leslie Knope," Well, I would say see you tomorrow, but…"
Ron Swanson,Great job.
Tom Haverford," Good work, Leslie."
Leslie Knope, Bye.
Jerry Gergich, See you.
Donna Meagle, Bye.
Jerry Gergich," See you soon, I hope."
Mark Brendanawicz, I liked this a lot better when it was a pit.
Mark Brendanawicz, Is that weird?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I called you Mark Brendana-quitz.
Mark Brendanawicz, Don't ever apologize to me.
Mark Brendanawicz, I'm serious.
Mark Brendanawicz," If everyone in government were like you, then I would probably still work there."
Leslie Knope, I got you a going away present.
Mark Brendanawicz, You did?
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope, Here.
Leslie Knope, Red tape.
Leslie Knope, So you'll never forget your roots.
Mark Brendanawicz, That's really nice of you.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Mark Brendanawicz," Well, I have something for you, too."
Leslie Knope, You do?
Mark Brendanawicz,I sort of threw together some plans for a future park.
Mark Brendanawicz, I couldn't fit everything in that you wanted.
Mark Brendanawicz, Like the roller coaster or the shark tank.
Mark Brendanawicz, But I think it's a pretty good start.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Mark Brendanawicz, You're really welcome.
Leslie Knope," But, you know, Pawnee's bankrupt."
Leslie Knope, I doubt I'll get to build a park anytime soon.
Mark Brendanawicz, I wouldn't bet against you.
Mark Brendanawicz, See you around.
Leslie Knope, Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope, Morning.
Ben Wyatt," Hi, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,Ron made me the official Parks and Rec representative for the budget discussions.
Ben Wyatt, That's only supposed to be--
Leslie Knope,Essential personnel?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," So, shall we get started?"
Leslie Knope,I have so many ideas.
Lucy, Is this an autographed picture of Jamie Foxx?
Tom Haverford,There it is.
Tom Haverford, Thank God.
Lucy, So how long is this shutdown going to last?
Tom Haverford,No idea.
Tom Haverford, I might have to get a temp job.
Tom Haverford, Maybe I should start working on my cologne line.
Tom Haverford, Uh-oh.
Tom Haverford, Check it out.
Tom Haverford," Whenever Ron has sex, the next morning, he comes in dressed like Tiger Woods."
Ron Swanson, You all set?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Lucy, What? Who is that?
Tom Haverford,That is my ex-wife.

Leslie Knope,Giddyup!
Narrator,Meet Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I am the pants queen!
Narrator,"Leslie loves whipped cream, dancing with friends, and working hard for the Parks Department of Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"Cut it out, Tom."
Tom Haverford,It never gets old.
Narrator,She also loves her coworkers at City Hall.
Narrator,Ron Swanson.
Narrator,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,Tommy Timberlake.
Narrator,April Ludgate.
April Ludgate,My mom is Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate,That's why I'm so lively and colorful.
Narrator,And Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Narrator,April and Andy like each other.
Narrator,"But when Andy accidentally kissed his exgirlfriend, Ann Perkins, April left."
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Narrator,And he hasn't seen her since.
Narrator,"In the midst of all this love, two black hats rode into town."
Chris Traeger,Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.
Chris Traeger,I believe I am that human being.
Narrator,And they brought with them some disturbing news.
Ben Wyatt,"Effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice."

Narrator,Will April and Andy make up and make out?
Narrator,Find out this season on Parks and Recreation.
Narrator,Starting right now.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,We're back.
Ron Swanson,Bully.
Leslie Knope,"The bankrupt government of Pawnee has been shut down all summer, so it's been three months of no work, no meetings, no memos, no late nights, nothing."
Leslie Knope,I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.
Leslie Knope,"Rounding up the team, so exciting."
Leslie Knope,I have goose bumps.
Leslie Knope,Feel.
Tom Haverford,And that's why they call me Prince Charming.
Tom Haverford,Because I always find the glass slipper for my Cinderella.
Extra,These are way too tight.
Tom Haverford,"Well, the real Cinderella didn't have hippo feet."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, we're back."
Tom Haverford,Jeremy!
Tom Haverford,Suck it!
Tom Haverford,"By the way, I've been giving away free sports bras to the girls at Hot Dog on a Stick."

Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"The nightmare's over, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,We're going back to work.
Leslie Knope,You're not going to need this anymore.
Leslie Knope,Come on!
Tom Haverford,I called shotgun.
Tom Haverford,Everybody heard me.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I am usually not one for speeches."
Ron Swanson,"So, goodbye."
Leslie Knope,"Break's over, mofos."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,We are operating on a shoestring budget.
Leslie Knope,Park services have been slashed.
Leslie Knope,But we are all still here.
Leslie Knope,And we have a job to do.
Tom Haverford,Make the world's biggest pizza.
Leslie Knope,"No, make this town fun for the people who live here."
Tom Haverford,"Fine, but after that, the pizza is our top priority."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Ron Swanson,We're getting pizza?
Andy Dwyer,"April, hey, it's me, Andy Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,"This is like the 200th message I've left you, without a response."
Andy Dwyer,"So, if you're trying to tell me something, I do not know what it is because you won't call me back."
Chris Traeger,"It is truly great to see all of you, huh?"
Chris Traeger,It's great news!
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,I have to run.
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"The bad news, which I get to deliver, is this."
Ben Wyatt,Your only work for the time being will be existing park maintenance.
Ben Wyatt,"So, that just means that we're in maintenance mode."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"See, I've spent the last few months brainstorming."
Leslie Knope,And I have some really great ideas and I put them in my idea binders.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're color coded, for God's sake."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,There is one thing that you will be doing.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, in Indiana, if you don't provide a basketball league, people get very upset."
Ben Wyatt,"And quite frankly, throw things at you and call you names."
Ben Wyatt,Like Turdboy.
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,The point is I reinstated youth basketball.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,It says here you only have money for two teams?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,They're going to develop a great rivalry.
Ron Swanson,"Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys into men, from men into gladiators, and from gladiators into Swansons."
Ron Swanson,Behold!
Ron Swanson,The Swanson Pyramid of Greatness.
Ron Swanson,I've been developing the Swanson Pyramid of Greatness for years.
Ron Swanson,It's a perfectly calibrated recipe for maximum personal achievement.
Ron Swanson,Categories include Capitalism.
Ron Swanson,"God's way of determining who is smart, and who is poor."
Ron Swanson,Crying.
Ron Swanson,Acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon.
Ron Swanson,Rage.
Ron Swanson,Poise.
Ron Swanson,Property rights.
Ron Swanson,"Fish, for sport only, not for meat."
Ron Swanson,Fish meat is practically a vegetable.
Ron Swanson,Haircuts.
Ron Swanson,There are three acceptable haircuts.
Ron Swanson,High and tight.
Ron Swanson,Crew cut.
Ron Swanson,Buzz cut.
Ron Swanson,"Are the scissors broken in your house, son?"
Ann Perkins,"So, are you happy to be back at work?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, our budget's been slashed to zero."
Leslie Knope,I tried to buy fertilizer the other day for the soccer field.
Leslie Knope,Request denied.
Leslie Knope,We literally can't buy shit.
Ann Perkins,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, when we were kids, the Parks Department would do these big projects."
Leslie Knope,"Winter Jamboree, the Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,It's like they don't have faith in us anymore.
Leslie Knope,"I'm not a paper pusher, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I need to be out in the streets, planting trees and cracking skulls."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,How are my two favorite people in this entire town?
Leslie Knope,"Not good, Chris."
Leslie Knope,There was a whole line of people in my office complaining that all their programs have been slashed.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, I know, it's terrible."
Chris Traeger,Is there anything we can do about that?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Chris Traeger,Damn!
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Ann, could I talk to you for a minute?"
Ben Wyatt,"So, how's it going?"
Leslie Knope,Save it.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I know you don't have faith in me and my department, and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,But don't expect me to sit here and chitchat with you.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope,Go the other way.
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm just going to that-- All right, I'II... "
Ann Perkins,"Look, I'm very flattered."
Ann Perkins,"But again, I don't think I should go out with you."
Chris Traeger,Can I ask you why not?
Chris Traeger,Because I thought we had a great time the night you got drunk and kissed me.
Chris Traeger,And you did use your tongue.
Ann Perkins,I just don't think I'm in a place to go out with anyone right now.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Did he ask you out again?
Ann Perkins,He did.
Ann Perkins,He did.
Ann Perkins,He is nothing if not persistent.
Ann Perkins,And hot.
Ann Perkins,He's very... He's pretty hot.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's hot."
Ann Perkins,But he's intense.
Ann Perkins,"But he's really, really hot."
Ann Perkins,But he's your boss.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I just thought of an idea of how we can save the Parks Department.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Leslie Knope,Let me ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,Would you be cool doing things that a prostitute does?
Leslie Knope,Minus the money?
Ann Perkins,"Definitely yes, then."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann."
Ron Swanson,Looking sharp.
Ron Swanson,Beautiful.
Ron Swanson,The backboard is your friend.
Andy Dwyer,"I'd say my coaching style is centered around fundamentals, with an emphasis on fun."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, watch this."
Andy Dwyer,Go get it.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,And a second emphasis on mental.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it can be hard work."
Andy Dwyer,But every time I look one of these kids in the eyes and he calls me Coach... That's how I know I agreed to be a coach.
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat!
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat!
Ron Swanson,Carnage!
Ron Swanson,Carnage!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, gentlemen."
Tom Haverford,It's time for the pregame coin toss.
Ron Swanson,There's no coin toss in basketball.
Ron Swanson,Are those women's sneakers?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, they are, Ron."
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,"They fit better, I got an employee discount, and the best part is no one can tell."
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's do this."
Tom Haverford,Match point.
Tom Haverford,Touchdown.
Tom Haverford,Et cetera.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Go, Lightning."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I like what you're wearing, but I need it to be 300% sexier."
Leslie Knope,Do you have any of those shirts that look wet all the time?
Ann Perkins,"Or, like, a metal bikini?"
Leslie Knope,You know what's always sexy?
Leslie Knope,Fingerless gloves.
Ann Perkins,"What about if I wear this normal, sane outfit?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but you're going to have to eat something sexy, then."
Leslie Knope,Like a banana.
Ann Perkins,For dinner?
Leslie Knope,"Well, what's sexy food?"
Leslie Knope,Asparagus?
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what's sexy?"
Leslie Knope,Turkey chili.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,And how exactly am I supposed to casually steer the conversation towards the Parks Department budget?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's totally easy.
Leslie Knope,Tell you what.
Leslie Knope,You be Chris.
Leslie Knope,I'll be you.
Leslie Knope,I'll show you how it's done.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,You are wonderful and amazing and I'm happy to be here with you.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Leslie Knope,I'm wearing a tuxedo vest with no shirt on underneath.
Ann Perkins,Can I get you a drink?
Ann Perkins,I love every single beverage in the world.
Leslie Knope,I would like some wine.
Leslie Knope,"And... Oops, my vest popped open."
Leslie Knope,Just like the budget needs to pop open and you need to pour it into my Parks Department.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Chris Traeger,I am so excited that you finally agreed to go out with me.
Chris Traeger,What a magnificent flip-flop.
Leslie Knope,You're a magnificent asker-outer.
Chris Traeger,Tell me every single detail of your day.
Chris Traeger,I love dates.
Chris Traeger,I love connecting with someone.
Chris Traeger,I love engaging them.
Chris Traeger,I love being surprised by them.
Chris Traeger,I have never had a bad date.
Chris Traeger,They've all been either great or phenomenally great.
Chris Traeger,Nurses are the most undervalued members of our society by far.
Chris Traeger,I think all of you should make as much money as the CEO of Google.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,I agree.
Ann Perkins,Can I ask you a question?
Chris Traeger,Why am I so positive all the time?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, that's exactly the question."
Chris Traeger,I was born with a blood disorder.
Chris Traeger,And my parents were told that I had three weeks to live.
Chris Traeger,"And here I still am, some 2,000 odd weeks later, and I have enjoyed every one of them."
Ann Perkins,I think it's going well.
Ann Perkins,He's actually a really nice guy.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, have you asked him yet about the money?"
Ann Perkins,"It's a date, you know?"
Ann Perkins,It's kind of hard to casually bring up the Parks budget when you're talking about your favorite movies.
Leslie Knope,Jurassic Park.
Leslie Knope,Parks are so great.
Leslie Knope,The Parks Department needs money.
Leslie Knope,I just did it in three moves.
Ann Perkins,"Well, then, why don't you just come here and do it yourself?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Holy crap!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Chris and Ann, what are you two doing here?"
Chris Traeger,We are on a date.
Chris Traeger,And it is going phenomenally.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, but I'll stay for just one drink."
Leslie Knope,"I am so happy I ran into you, because I wanted to speak to you about--"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, well, well."
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Chris Traeger,What a fun surprise.
Ben Wyatt,"That's right, you were coming here tonight on a date."
Ben Wyatt,"And hey, Leslie is joining you on this wonderfully romantic occasion."
Ben Wyatt,How about that?
Chris Traeger,Fantastic!
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Ben Wyatt,"Just confirming a suspicion I had, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,I had nothing to do with this date.
Leslie Knope,They're both so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,They probably just want to see each other naked.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I know what you're trying to do, and you're not that good at being sneaky."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you're not."
Leslie Knope,I'm great at being sneaky.
Ben Wyatt,"Clearly, you're not."
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,"You guys, let's all have dinner together."
Chris Traeger,The more the merrier.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"Great job, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Eric."
Andy Dwyer,"Taking a rest, or are you hurt?"
Andy Dwyer,Taking a rest?
Andy Dwyer,Smart.
Ron Swanson,"Destroy them, gentlemen."
Ron Swanson,Feel no sympathy.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, Ron Swanson is dating my exwife, Wendy."
Tom Haverford,Big deal.
Tom Haverford,"My girlfriend, Lucy, is the sexiest woman in town."
Tom Haverford,"She's Cuban, she's got tattoos, and she's into me, which, as far as I'm concerned, is the sexiest quality a woman can have."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope,You know what would be really fun?
Leslie Knope,"After dinner, we should take a walk by the pond in Ramsett Park."
Chris Traeger,Walking in parks can be very romantic.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, too bad the park's always closed, though."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you two are on a date."
Ben Wyatt,"So, Leslie and I should probably get going."
Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm actually having a good time with everyone."
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger,I'm having a fantastic time.
Chris Traeger,"What do you say we take this whole ""date plus two other people"" thing up into the stratosphere?"
Chris Traeger,This place is outstanding!
Chris Traeger,"Great call, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,Look.
Chris Traeger,Even Ben's dancing.
Ron Swanson,"That's the way to shoot the ball, Chignoli."
Ron Swanson,Hustle back.
Tom Haverford,That's a foul!
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,On whom?
Tom Haverford,Your team.
Tom Haverford,Number 50.
Tom Haverford,He was double dribbling.
Ron Swanson,He's on defense.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,That's a technical difficulty.
Tom Haverford,"So, that means Andy's team throws the ball from the stripey thing."
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Ron Swanson,"""The stripey thing""?"
Extra,"Hey, there, how's it going?"
Chris Traeger,"Great, thanks."
Extra,Can I buy you a drink?
Chris Traeger,I'm very flattered.
Chris Traeger,"But this is my stunningly gorgeous date, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Extra,Hi.
Extra,Sorry.
Chris Traeger,No problem.
Chris Traeger,"In fact, let me buy all of you a drink for being so welcoming today."
Chris Traeger,Waiter!
Ann Perkins,I think I may actually like Chris.
Extra,"On the house, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sort of a gay hero.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, I married two penguins at the zoo, and it turned out they were both gay."
Ben Wyatt,Penguin wedding?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,That's cute.
Leslie Knope,It was so cute.
Leslie Knope,But enough about how cute it was.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you think I should have the money?
Ben Wyatt,Good Lord.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Look.
Ben Wyatt,"When I was 18 and I became mayor of my hometown, I used every last dollar we had to open a giant winter sports complex."
Ben Wyatt,Called it Ice Town.
Leslie Knope,And it turned out great and everyone loved it.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, kind of."
Ben Wyatt,"It was never completed, and I got impeached."
Ben Wyatt,"The newspaper headline was, ""Ice Town Costs Ice Clown His Town Crown."""
Ben Wyatt,They were big into rhymes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know."
Leslie Knope,I think Ice Town sounds great.
Leslie Knope,"And the point is, at least you tried something."
Tom Haverford,Foul!
Tom Haverford,Foul on number three for taking a number two on number four.
Tom Haverford,Roughing the passer!
Tom Haverford,Double dribbling!
Tom Haverford,That's a foul!
Tom Haverford,That's a foul for touching the basketball.
Tom Haverford,What are you going to do about it?
Tom Haverford,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,You fouled.
Tom Haverford,You can't do anything.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,You're ejected.
Tom Haverford,You're ejected.
Tom Haverford,"What's the matter there, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,No players left?
Tom Haverford,Andy's team!
Tom Haverford,Look at them go!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, come on."
Ron Swanson,"Now, you're openly cheering for the other team?"
Ron Swanson,Put my boys back in.
Tom Haverford,You made me the ref.
Tom Haverford,Deal with it.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Take this uniform off.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Ron Swanson,You don't deserve to wear it.
Tom Haverford,Ron's ejected for molesting the ref!
Ron Swanson,Yeah?
Ron Swanson,I'm ejected?
Wendy,"Tom, what are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, you are."
Tom Haverford,I'm ejecting you.
Tom Haverford,"You're ejected, too."
Tom Haverford,Everyone's ejected.
Ron Swanson,She's ejected?
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,"Go ahead, go!"
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a forfeit."
Tom Haverford,Andy's team wins.
Andy Dwyer,No way!
Andy Dwyer,We won?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man!"
Andy Dwyer,Eat it!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,I dedicate this victory to April Ludgate.
Andy Dwyer,It feels good.
Andy Dwyer,And it feels sticky.
Andy Dwyer,From the Gatorade.
Leslie Knope,We're barely able to function.
Leslie Knope,We could really use that money.
Chris Traeger,"Well, you know, I don't know if it's because I'm in such a good mood or because of the charming Ann Perkins, but I am going to seriously consider that."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,Mission accomplished.
Leslie Knope, Let's boogie.
Chris Traeger, Mission accomplished?
Leslie Knope, Yeah. There's a mission that Ann had thought of.
Leslie Knope," It was both of our ideas, but it was mostly Ann's."
Leslie Knope, We I had mentioned to Ann that it would be fun if you two went on a date.
Leslie Knope," So, then, you could talk about the money, and then, you know, maybe give it to me."
Chris Traeger, Wow.
Chris Traeger, I've just had my first bad date.
Chris Traeger, Ann Perkins.
Ben Wyatt, Not that sneaky.
Andy Dwyer," April! April! Where have you been? Oh, my God."
April Ludgate, Hey.
Andy Dwyer, How are you?
April Ludgate,I'm okay.
Andy Dwyer, I'm dying to see you.
Andy Dwyer," I called and I texted you, like, a billion times."
April Ludgate, I'm sorry.
April Ludgate, I was in Venezuela.
Andy Dwyer, Really? Wow.
Andy Dwyer, Across the pond.
Andy Dwyer, Wow.
Andy Dwyer, I thought maybe I would have heard from you at least once.
Andy Dwyer, Because of what happened.
Andy Dwyer, Ann kissing me? I am so sorry about that.
Andy Dwyer, It was so stupid and it meant nothing.
April Ludgate, I wouldn't worry about it.
April Ludgate, It's totally fine.
April Ludgate, Hey.
April Ludgate," This is my boyfriend, Eduardo."
Andy Dwyer," No, it's not."
April Ludgate, That means we're going to lunch.
Andy Dwyer," How do you say, ""Have a great time, don't choke on anything""?"
April Ludgate,Bye.
Ann Perkins, Leslie asked me to do her a favor.
Ann Perkins," And I love her, so I did it."
Ann Perkins," I'm sorry, and I'm here to eat crow."
Ann Perkins, I like you a lot.
Ann Perkins, Let's go out again.
Chris Traeger, Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope, Budget solution number 28.
Leslie Knope, Use grazing sheep to mow grass in parks.
Leslie Knope, Note.
Leslie Knope, Tired sheep could become food or sweaters.
Andy Dwyer," Well, I got my answer."
Andy Dwyer, About April.
Andy Dwyer, She hates me.
Andy Dwyer, Yeah.
Andy Dwyer," And she got a boyfriend, I guess."
Andy Dwyer, From some city in Mexico.
Andy Dwyer, So what do I do?
Leslie Knope,"Okay. Well, when your back's against the wall and odds are stacked against you, you just... You... You swing the hardest, damn it."
Leslie Knope, You go big or you go home.
Leslie Knope, And you don't seem like the kind of guy who goes home.
Andy Dwyer, I'm not.
Andy Dwyer, I don't even really have a home.
Leslie Knope," Go get her, Andy."
Andy Dwyer," Okay! Okay, thanks, Leslie."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," So, we know the people who run this government have no faith in us."
Leslie Knope, My plan is going to change that and bring the budget back.
Leslie Knope, And the answer's been right in front of us the whole time.
April Ludgate, Check your testicles?
Leslie Knope,No. Not that.
Leslie Knope, Although that is very good advice.
Leslie Knope," Looking at you, Jerry."
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, What's going to save us is right there.
Leslie Knope," Gentlemen, I realize that times are tough and the budget is tight."
Leslie Knope," But if the people of this town have nothing else to do but sit in their houses and play video games, then Pawnee will die."
Leslie Knope, And we refuse to let that happen.
Leslie Knope, Now.
Leslie Knope, This town was historically known for two things.
Leslie Knope," Widespread obesity, and the annual Pawnee Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope, People from all over Indiana would come and gaze in wonderment at how fat our citizens were.
Leslie Knope," And while they were here, they would also attend the Festival, a full week of corn mazes, hay rides, Ferris wheels, pumpkins the size ofjeeps."
Leslie Knope," We lost that festival a few years ago, due to another round of budget cuts."
Leslie Knope, And I propose we bring the festival back.
Leslie Knope," With ticket sales and corporate sponsorship, we'll earn all that money back."
Leslie Knope," And believe me, people will come."
Ben Wyatt, What if they don't?
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you eliminate the Parks Department."
Ben Wyatt, And you guys are all on board with this.
Ron Swanson, Aye.
Everyone,Yes.
Leslie Knope," Look, we're not just pencil pushers."
Leslie Knope, We are a reflection of the community.
Leslie Knope, And we believe that we can strengthen that community.
Leslie Knope," Because in the end, the reason why we're all here is to bring people together."
Chris Traeger," That, literally, is the most moving thing I've ever heard."
Chris Traeger, And a good idea.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, all right."
Leslie Knope, Excellent! Great! Okay.
Leslie Knope," So, everybody, we're going to party hard for 15 minutes and then, we're going to have our first brainstorming session."
Andy Dwyer," Hello, April."
Andy Dwyer, Do you like the flowers?
April Ludgate,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer," All due respect, Eduardo. You seem like a great guy."
Andy Dwyer, But I like April.
Andy Dwyer, And I'm coming after her with everything I've got.
Andy Dwyer," So, do you want to go out with me? No."
Andy Dwyer, I thought you were going to say yes.
Andy Dwyer, But that's okay.
Andy Dwyer, Because I'll be back tomorrow to ask you again.
Andy Dwyer, And again the next day.
Andy Dwyer, And the next day.
Andy Dwyer, Not Friday.
Andy Dwyer, I have to go visit my cousin.
Andy Dwyer, But I will be back after that to ask you again.
Eduardo, You should do it.
Eduardo, Follow your dream.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer, Really? That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer, I'll see you tomorrow.
,Season: 3 Episode: 02
Ann Perkins,There is a crazy flu going around.
Ann Perkins,"Lots of miserable, dehydrated people with high fevers and diarrhea."
Ann Perkins,"And one of those dehydrated, highfevered, miserable people is April."
Ann Perkins,Who hates me.
April Ludgate,I want another nurse.
Ann Perkins,"Well, there are none."
Ann Perkins,We're stretched pretty thin right now.
April Ludgate,"Then, I want a janitor."
April Ludgate,"They can do what you do, right?"
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Ann Perkins,Nurses and janitors are totally interchangeable.
April Ludgate,Except no one dresses up like a janitor when they want to be slutty.
Ann Perkins,I get the sense that maybe you're angry at me for kissing Andy.
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,What are you talking about?
Ann Perkins,That's crazy.
Ann Perkins,And that you think it might be fun to take it out on me.
Ann Perkins,Please don't do that.
April Ludgate,Do?
April Ludgate,I can't do anything.
April Ludgate,I'm sick.
April Ludgate,My blankets are on the floor.
Leslie Knope,"So, JJ, we wanted to talk to you about the Harvest Festival."
JJ,"Yeah, I heard you were bringing that back."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, I haven't been feeling myself."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm organizing this huge Harvest Festival  and I need at least 80 local businesses to participate."
Leslie Knope,And normally this is the kind of thing I would love to do.
Leslie Knope,"But, I'm just feeling really tired."
Leslie Knope,I think maybe my allergies are acting up.
Leslie Knope,"I've already vomited, like, five times today."
Leslie Knope,We're having a meeting tonight at the Chamber of Commerce  and we're going to go over all the details.
Leslie Knope,And we'd just love if you could come and join us.
JJ,Sure.
JJ,Anything for my favorite customer.
Leslie Knope,I bet you say that to all the girls.
JJ,"Oh, no."
JJ,"No, actually, you're my favorite."
JJ,"You spent over 1,000 dollars last year on waffles alone."
Ron Swanson,Here.
Ron Swanson,"I didn't know what to bring you,  so I just got some magazines and lipstick."
Ron Swanson,Woman stuff.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,All my parents got me was that.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, well, I'm not very good at visiting people in hospitals, so I'm going to go."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"If you see Andy, will you not tell him I'm here?"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Because of what happened,  I don't want him to think--"
Ron Swanson,Stop!
Ron Swanson,Don't want to know.
Ron Swanson,"The less I know about other people's affairs, the happier I am."
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in caring about people.
Ron Swanson,I once worked with a guy for three years and never learned his name.
Ron Swanson,Best friend I ever had.
Ron Swanson,We still never talk sometimes.
Leslie Knope,"So, we've developed a revenue sharing formula  that will hopefully appeal to most business owners, but--"
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Go home.
Tom Haverford,You're sick.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sick.
Leslie Knope,It's just allergies.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in there.
Donna Meagle,No.
Jerry Gergich,You can't come in here.
Tom Haverford,You're not coming in.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you look tired and you're all sweaty."
Leslie Knope,You look tired and you're all sweaty  all the time.
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Leslie Knope,"You want to go there, Jerry?"
Jerry Gergich,No.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'm coming in."
Tom Haverford,"Donna, barricade the door now."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, come on."
Leslie Knope,Just let me in.
Donna Meagle,Mmmmmm.
Tom Haverford,Either go home or go back into quarantine.
Leslie Knope,I'm not going home.
Jerry Gergich,"Get out of here, Leslie."
Donna Meagle,Hit the bricks.
Jerry Gergich,Come on.
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Jerry Gergich,She's germing up all my stuff.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, yuck!"
Jerry Gergich,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,How was your run?
Chris Traeger,Ended with a five and a half minute mile.
Chris Traeger,My personal low.
Chris Traeger,I think the pavement in this town is soft.
Ann Perkins,What's with the mask?
Chris Traeger,Flu prevention.
Chris Traeger,"My body is finely tuned, like a microchip,  and the flu is like a grain of sand."
Ann Perkins,It could literally shut down the entire system.
Ann Perkins,"My body's like a chip, too."
Ann Perkins,A potato chip.
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,"Speaking of potato chips, you and I are on for dinner tomorrow, yes?"
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Definitely.
Ann Perkins,"I'm super, super excited."
Ann Perkins,Looking forward to it.
Chris Traeger,Excellent.
Chris Traeger,"Way to go, buddy."
Chris Traeger,Way to go.
Ann Perkins,We've been on a couple of dates.
Ann Perkins,I really like him.
Ann Perkins,The problem is he's like a perfect human man.
Ann Perkins,I can't find one flaw.
Ann Perkins,There was one time I thought he farted.
Ann Perkins,But it was me.
Ron Swanson,I need to find someone to fill in for April.
Ron Swanson,"Now, I know I'm not going to find someone  who's both aggressively mean and apathetic."
Ron Swanson,April really is the whole package.
Ron Swanson,But I think I might know someone  who will be just as ineffective.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,What's new?
Andy Dwyer,A whole lot!
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,I just invented it.
Ron Swanson,Superstraw.
Ron Swanson,"So, just sit here and do your thing."
Andy Dwyer,Do I have to tuck my shirt in?
Andy Dwyer,"Because, honestly, that's kind of a deal breaker."
Ron Swanson,Let it fly.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, wait."
Andy Dwyer,Where is April?
Andy Dwyer,Is she all right?
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I just gave her the day off.
Andy Dwyer,Would it be weird if I asked for the day off?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, no, it's okay."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't think so.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Are you leaving?
Ben Wyatt,I thought we had a meeting.
Leslie Knope,"No, we do."
Leslie Knope,It's just I think it's a little chilly in here.
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,Your eyes are glassy.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my Is she Is she sick?"
Chris Traeger,Are you sick?
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,She's sick.
Tom Haverford,"That's why I'm wearing this, and misting myself with hand sanitizer."
Leslie Knope,I am not sick.
Leslie Knope,"I just have allergies, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I took a Claritin and I threw that up,  so I took another one."
Leslie Knope,I threw that up.
Leslie Knope,"And then, I took a third and it stayed down."
Leslie Knope,I'm getting better.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,You're burning up.
Leslie Knope,You're burning up.
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris Traeger,I have to get out of here.
Chris Traeger,I have 2.8% body fat.
Chris Traeger,My body is like a microchip.
Chris Traeger,A grain of sand could destroy it.
Chris Traeger,My body's a microchip.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, go home."
Leslie Knope,"No, I can't."
Leslie Knope,I can't go home.
Leslie Knope,I have to get ready for the Chamber of Secrets.
Ben Wyatt,Commerce.
Leslie Knope,"If this meeting does not go perfectly,  then the Harvest Festival is going to be over before it begins."
Leslie Knope,I cannot go home.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, then, who's your doctor?"
Leslie Knope,Ann's my doctor.
Leslie Knope,And she's the most beautiful nurse in the world.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm hot."
Leslie Knope,"Now, it's really hot in here."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's your fever."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I typed your symptoms into the thing up here,  and it says you could have ""network connectivity problems""."
Ann Perkins,104.1
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you're dehydrated."
Ann Perkins,I'm admitting you.
Leslie Knope,"If I was sick, could I do this?"
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Cartwheels.
Leslie Knope,Am I not doing them?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, don't worry."
Ben Wyatt,"I've done presentations like this before,  and Tom will be with me."
Ben Wyatt,"So, you're in good hands."
Leslie Knope,It's not that I don't trust Ben.
Leslie Knope,It's that I don't have faith in Ben.
Leslie Knope,"And, also, I'm starting to forget who Ben is."
Ben Wyatt,I'll handle the general outline.
Ben Wyatt,If you want to just jump right in.
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,The worst thing you can do with an important presentation like this  is overprepare.
Tom Haverford,"So,  I think it's best if I go to the spa."
Ben Wyatt,"No, we promised Leslie we'd prep for the meeting."
Tom Haverford,"No, Ben."
Tom Haverford,You promised Leslie.
Tom Haverford,"See, I never promise Leslie anything."
Tom Haverford,"That way, I never disappoint her."
Tom Haverford,I try to be considerate.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I am off for a soak and a schvitz."
Tom Haverford,Arrivederch.
Andy Dwyer,Ron Swanson's office.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I will transfer you."
Andy Dwyer,I just dropped another call.
Ann Perkins,I thought you might like a fresh set of pillows.
April Ludgate,Are you trying to smother me?
April Ludgate,Help!
April Ludgate,This slutty nurse is trying to  smother me to death with a pillow!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, never mind."
April Ludgate,"Stay back, slut!"
Ann Perkins,I know what she's trying to do.
Ann Perkins,She's trying to get me to break.
Ann Perkins,And you know what?
Ann Perkins,I'm not going to do it.
Ann Perkins,I'm going to be professional and I'm going to put on a happy face.
Ann Perkins,"And then, I'm going to go into a supply closet  and snap a bunch of tongue depressors."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, let's talk about your opening remarks."
Leslie Knope,Do you want me to write you a rap?
Leslie Knope,I'll write you a rap.
Leslie Knope,"No, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,You're never going to be able to pull it off.
Leslie Knope,You're too white.
Leslie Knope,How about a show tune or something?
Ben Wyatt,"I was just planning to introduce myself, nonmusically,  and then, get everyone to refer to their packets."
Ben Wyatt,"And blah, blah, blah."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No ""blah, blah, blah"", okay?"
Ben Wyatt,You need to go over every single detail with me.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I promise you I won't halfass this."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Now, get some rest."
Leslie Knope,I have some great news.
Leslie Knope,I think my fever just broke.
Ben Wyatt,Goodbye.
Andy Dwyer,It just came out.
Ron Swanson,I am starving.
Ron Swanson,I haven't had lunch since yesterday.
Ron Swanson,"So, I'm going to head over to Callahan's."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,Don't go there.
Andy Dwyer,They totally skimp on pickles.
Andy Dwyer,Let me go to Big Head Joe's for you.
Andy Dwyer,They have the most insane burritos.
Ron Swanson,I don't much go for ethnic food.
Andy Dwyer,"No, trust me."
Andy Dwyer,"They have one that's called the ""Meat Tornado""."
Andy Dwyer,It literally killed a guy last year.
Ron Swanson,"You had me at ""Meat Tornado""."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,That flu medicine really helped.
Leslie Knope,I feel a thousand percent better.
Leslie Knope,Good as new.
Leslie Knope,Does this scarf look okay?
Leslie Knope,I don't want to look stuffy.
Leslie Knope,"But I also don't want to look too ""schlubby""."
Ann Perkins,Get back in that bed.
Leslie Knope,So no to the scarf?
Ann Perkins,Get back in the bed.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm going to that meeting."
Ann Perkins,"Either you get back in the bed, or I will strap you down."
Ann Perkins,I've done it before.
Ann Perkins,Don't test me.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, okay."
Tom Haverford,"Now, what superpower would you rather have?"
Tom Haverford,Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?
Tom Haverford,"Ed, go first."
Extra,"Fly, I guess."
Tom Haverford,I forgot to tell you.
Tom Haverford,You can only fly five feet above the ground.
Tom Haverford,I bring a certain panache and spice  to the spa experience for these guys.
Tom Haverford,"Before I joined, they were just three old white dudes  quietly boiling in hot water."
Tom Haverford,Would you rather live in the pocket of a giant kangaroo  or have a pocket on your own stomach  that has a tiny kangaroo in it all the time?
Tom Haverford,Preston.
Extra,Tiny kangaroo in my stomach pocket.
Tom Haverford,"Forgot to mention, the tiny kangaroo is a racist."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,What happened?
Ann Perkins,"I just saw you a few hours ago, and you were fine."
Ann Perkins,"Not like, ""Damn, you're fine,"" but fine healthwise."
Chris Traeger,My body has no fat to protect itself from disease.
Chris Traeger,Things happen very quickly.
Chris Traeger,Listen to me.
Chris Traeger,It's very important that you replenish my body with electrolytes  after every involuntary loss of bodily fluids.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Chris Traeger,My body tends to lose  a lot of fluids when it's sick.
Chris Traeger,My brain is on fire.
Chris Traeger,I'm dying.
Ann Perkins,"Well, you definitely have the flu."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,The microchip has been compromised.
Andy Dwyer,Pierre Garcon was a sixthround pick.
Ron Swanson,Collie was the fourth round.
Andy Dwyer,Indianapolis Colts know how to draft so well.
Ron Swanson,They really do.
Ron Swanson,"Andy, this was delicious."
Andy Dwyer,"It's awesome, huh?"
Ron Swanson,It's a whole new meat delivery system.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, son."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say we go out to the parking lot,  run a few pass plays to burn off the calories?"
Ron Swanson,You are an unstoppable good idea machine!
Ron Swanson,I like Andy.
Ron Swanson,I'm surrounded by a lot of women in this department.
Ron Swanson,And that includes the men.
Ron Swanson,"Hup, hup, hup!"
Andy Dwyer,Peyton Manning reading the defense!
Andy Dwyer,"Reggie Wayne, Colts corner!"
Ron Swanson,"Andy, wait up!"
Ann Perkins,"Hey, April."
Ann Perkins,I saw that you called for me.
Ann Perkins,What can I do for you?
April Ludgate,I need more flu medicine.
Ann Perkins,An actual request.
Ann Perkins,"Well, you can't have any."
Ann Perkins,"That stuff is powerful, no extra doses."
April Ludgate,I didn't take any.
April Ludgate,Leslie came in here and stole it and left.
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Ann Perkins,Leslie!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, have you seen Leslie?"
Chris Traeger,"I had a dream  that she came into this room,  stole my flu medicine, told me not to tell you,  and then disappeared through that hole in the wall."
Ann Perkins,The door?
Ben Wyatt,"Maybe we should get, like, a suite here for them, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt!
Leslie Knope,Hello!
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Good to see you.
Ben Wyatt,"You, too."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you're really burning up."
Leslie Knope,"Can I get some money for the cab that I took over here, please?"
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,How much?
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,"I looked at the meter, and it had Egyptian hieroglyphics on it."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Do you know the exchange rate?
Leslie Knope,So should we do this?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,Be careful.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,The floor and the wall just switched.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Walk very carefully.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I find it a little insulting  that you don't trust me to handle this."
Leslie Knope,"It's not that I don't trust you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,It's just this Harvest Festival is my project.
Leslie Knope,It's my career on the line.
Leslie Knope,And I just need to make sure that  I've done everything I can to make it work.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's show time.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Good evening, everyone."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Monster.
Leslie Knope,And this is Nightline.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I wouldn't open with that."
Leslie Knope,No?
Ben Wyatt,Why don't we sit down.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Libertarianism is all about individual liberty.
Ron Swanson,"And it should never be defined by the terms ""liberal"" or ""conservative."""
Andy Dwyer,"And communism is no good, right?"
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Ron Swanson,Big swing and a miss.
Andy Dwyer,And what's the word for when a few clerics are in charge?
Andy Dwyer,Religious oligarchy.
Andy Dwyer,I can remember things.
Ron Swanson,I guess.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, keep mine rare."
Ron Swanson,A man after my own heart.
Chris Traeger,I vomited somewhere in this room.
Chris Traeger,"I don't remember where, though."
Chris Traeger,Wait.
Chris Traeger,You might want to check that drawer.
Chris Traeger,Stop pooping.
Ann Perkins,You have to get up off the floor now.
Chris Traeger,This floor is my friend.
Ann Perkins,Nothing like a complete physical breakdown  to make a guy seem less intimidating.
Ann Perkins,I love the flu.
Tom Haverford,"And then I said, ""You know what?"
Tom Haverford,"""I think we need to get these bananas out of here."""
Tom Haverford,"Have a seat, boys."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Tom, glad you could make it."
Ben Wyatt,You have a nice day with your spa buddies?
Tom Haverford,"Actually, yes, Ben, I did."
Tom Haverford,"And my spa buddies own a couple of car dealerships in town,  and they've agreed to donate a fleet of vehicles for Harvest Festival,  twenty five vans for the entire event."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I'm ready."
Leslie Knope,Get up there and introduce me.
Tom Haverford,You got it.
Ben Wyatt,"I can't let you do this, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this ain't your call, McCluskey."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ron, can I ask you a question?"
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,It's about April.
Ron Swanson,I don't like to get involved in people's personal
Andy Dwyer,"I hurt her feelings, and now she's pissed at me."
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like if I could just explain myself, she'd understand,  but she's avoiding me."
Andy Dwyer,It's making me miserable.
Ron Swanson,"April's in the hospital, sick with the flu."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,I knew it!
Andy Dwyer,I didn't know that.
Andy Dwyer,Is she okay?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, she's fine."
Ron Swanson,You can go visit her tomorrow morning.
Ron Swanson,But don't tell her I told you.
Andy Dwyer,I won't.
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no."
Ron Swanson,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Before we get started, a quick announcement."
Tom Haverford,Every Thursday night is ladies' night  down at the Snakehole Lounge over on Burnham Avenue.
Tom Haverford,Ladies get two drinks for the price of one.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, that can't be right."
Tom Haverford,That's way too good of a deal.
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,That is what it says.
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,That sounds like a fun time.
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, it is now my great honor to welcome to the stage  the woman responsible for the entire Harvest Festival."
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, Leslie Knope!"
Leslie Knope,"Every one of you, just by showing up here tonight,  has already made history."
Leslie Knope,"In days past, the Harvest Festival was the cornerstone  of Pawnee's smallbusiness community,  a weeklong showcase  for everything from textiles to small farms."
Leslie Knope,"  By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival,  and the monetary value  of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure  is, frankly, incalculable."
April Ludgate,What?
Ann Perkins," Three, two, one."
Ann Perkins,"  And my shift's over."
Ann Perkins,What the [bleep] is your problem?
April Ludgate,Whoa I thought you weren't gonna lose it.
Ann Perkins,"Well I was on duty,  I didn't."
Ann Perkins, Now it's just me.
Ann Perkins,"  I get that you're mad that I kissed Andy, okay?  But it was a moment of confusion, and it was a mistake."
Ann Perkins,"  And I'm very sorry."
Ann Perkins,"
  You want to hate me forever?"
April Ludgate,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Fine!
  You know what?
 I don't care."
Ann Perkins,"  But you shouldn't take it out on Andy,  because he really likes you, and he did nothing wrong."
Ann Perkins,"  And just for the record, I'm starting to hate you, too."
April Ludgate,"  That's the most I've ever liked Ann."
Leslie Knope,"  The time is now."
Leslie Knope,"  The place is Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"  Let's make history."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,That was amazing.
Ben Wyatt,"  That was a flu-ridden Michael Jordan at the '97 NBA finals."
Ben Wyatt,"  That was Kirk Gibson hobbling up to the plate  and hitting a homer off of Dennis Eckersley."
Ben Wyatt,"  That was  That was Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"  Thank you so much."
Leslie Knope,Any questions? Yes sir?
Extra,Are we going to get the same sales-tax incentives we used to? 
Leslie Knope,"That's a very good question, sir, and I would counter with my own question, which is,  why is half of your face all swirly?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, unfortunately, Leslie has another very important meeting right now. So if you have any other questions,  you can just direct them towards me."
Leslie Knope,"  Give it up, everybody, for Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap."
Ben Wyatt,"  All right."
Ben Wyatt," Okay, let's  Excuse me."
Ben Wyatt,"  And to answer your question, sir,  there will be sales-tax incentives this year."
Tom Haverford,"  I think I should drive you to the hospital."
Leslie Knope,"
  Was I wearing a tiara
 when I came in here?
  Because if you happen upon it,
  will you have Lady Pennyface
 retrieve it and send it post-hence?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, there."
Ben Wyatt,"
I got you some waffles here,
 courtesy of JJ's diner,
  and chicken soup,
 courtesy of me."
Leslie Knope,I'll take the waffles.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,So how did the rest of the meeting go?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you said you needed eighty total businesses to participate."
Leslie Knope,"  Yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"  We have 110,  and counting."
Ben Wyatt,"  So, nice work, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"  Nice work to you too."
Ben Wyatt,"  Left the chicken soup there, just in case."
Ben Wyatt,"  It's an old family recipe."
Ben Wyatt,"
 It's not a big deal, but."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for that.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"  Hi, April."
Andy Dwyer," It's me, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"  Just stay sleeping."
Andy Dwyer,"  I am going to be here when you wake up."
Andy Dwyer,"  I will not leave your side."
Andy Dwyer,"  You could be asleep for hours."
Andy Dwyer," Maybe I'll come back later."
Andy Dwyer,"  Hope you feel better."
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"  And I know you think that I'm a jerk, but I hope you can forgive me."
Andy Dwyer,"  Gross."
Andy Dwyer," Your forehead is all sweaty."
Andy Dwyer, That's gross.
Andy Dwyer,"  But I still like you."
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"  That's disgusting."
Ben Wyatt,"  Got your message."
Chris Traeger,"
 What's up?
  I got a call from
 the boys upstairs."
Chris Traeger,"  And they have a new assignment for us."
Ben Wyatt,"
Okay."
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,"  And I feel like we should ask for an extension to stay here."
Ben Wyatt,"  Yes, definitely."
Ben Wyatt,"  You know, the festival thing's getting pretty huge,  and a couple loose ends that need tying up."
Chris Traeger,"
  Good, so I'll make the call then,
 to get the extension?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, they need our help."
Chris Traeger,For the loose ends.
Chris Traeger,"
 Great."
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"
  Okay, you need
 a ride back to the office?"
Chris Traeger,"No, no, I'm gonna go for a light 15k."
Chris Traeger," I missed yesterday."
Chris Traeger,"  Way to go, buddy."
Chris Traeger," Way to go."

Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, what have you chosen to put in the time capsule?"
Jerry Gergich,These are my mother's diaries.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, she lived in Pawnee all of her life and recorded everything she ever did."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, so it's, you know, kind of like a living document about the town."
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,A disappointingly good idea from Jerry.
Leslie Knope,"Better than good, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
April Ludgate,Give me that.
April Ludgate,"""January 18, 1964."""
April Ludgate,"""Jerrold starred in his school production of Peter Pan."""
April Ludgate,"""He was a beautiful Tinker Bell."""
Jerry Gergich,It was an all boys school.
Eduardo,Jerry!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie, I have an idea."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't we put Eduardo in there and seal the top so that he suffocates and dies?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, you're up."
Tom Haverford,"For my item, I chose a picture of my exgirlfriend Lucy with a mustache drawn on her face and stink lines coming off her, 'cause she stinks."
Tom Haverford,She broke up with me.
Tom Haverford,Didn't really tell me why.
Tom Haverford,"Luckily, when you're the guy, you can just tell people she's crazy."
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, Tom, I heard you and Lucy broke up."""
Tom Haverford,"""Yeah, man."""
Tom Haverford,"""Turns out she's crazy."""
Tom Haverford,That's what they always do on Entourage.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Ron Swanson,"I am submitting this menu from a Pawnee institution, JJ's diner, home of the world's best breakfast dish, The Four Horsemeals of the Eggporkcalypse."
Ron Swanson,"Wendy loves it, too."
Leslie Knope,And I am submitting this.
Leslie Knope,A brief history of everything that has ever happened since Pawnee was founded.
Leslie Knope,"Not like you get extra credit for this, but I did type it from memory."
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time ever compiled, it includes a complete list of every official town slogan we've ever had."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Can you believe it?
April Ludgate,That's crazy.
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Paris of America."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The Akron of Southwest Indiana."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, German soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"After the Nazis took France, our mayor kind of panicked."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""The factory fire capital of America."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Welcome, Vietnamese soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Engage with Zorp."""
Leslie Knope,"For a brief time in the '70s, our town was taken over by a cult."
Leslie Knope,Zorp is dead.
Leslie Knope,Long live Zorp.
Leslie Knope,It's safe to be here now.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Birthplace of Julia Roberts."""
Leslie Knope,"That was a lie, she sued, and so we had to change it."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""Home of the world-famous Julia Roberts lawsuit."""
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Welcome, Taliban soldiers."""
Leslie Knope,"And finally, our current slogan."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, ""First in friendship, fourth in obesity."""
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Pawnee has had its set of problems, but this time capsule is our way of saying that Pawnee is gonna be around for a long time Capsule."
Leslie Knope,And you can quote me on that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I'm actually gonna quote you on all of this, 'cause it's a newspaper article."
Leslie Knope,I thought of a great headline.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Leslie Knope,"""It's Time to Encapsulate the Future."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Good one.
Leslie Knope,"Sub headline, ""The Parks Department Cuts the Crapsule, Buries the Time Capsule."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'll be back tomorrow with the photographer.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, this guy's here."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Can I help you?
Kelly Larson,I'm Kelly Larson.
Kelly Larson,"I read online about your time capsule, and I'm here to make a suggestion."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,We're not taking Twilight books.
Kelly Larson,"It's a beautifully told saga of vampires, werewolves and romance."
Leslie Knope,You are the person that's been emailing me about Twilight.
Leslie Knope,I thought you would be younger.
Leslie Knope,And a girl.
Kelly Larson,"Well, I'm not."
Kelly Larson,I'm older and a boy.
Kelly Larson,But I feel very strongly that these should be included.
Kelly Larson,Can I tell you why?
Leslie Knope,"Sure, Kelly."
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Kelly Larson,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,And plead your case.
Kelly Larson,Thanks.
Kelly Larson,"Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973."
Kelly Larson,"Author Stephenie Meyer, nee Morgan, was born in Hartford, Connecticut."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You're going all the way back to her birth.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"So basically, Ann kissed me and then April kissed me, and I told April, because of honesty is important."
Chris Traeger,That's so true.
Andy Dwyer,"But now she's gone and gotten herself a Venezuelan boyfriend who's, like, the handsomest dude I've ever seen."
Andy Dwyer,Present company excluded.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,I was talking about me.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,Andy just gave me a phenomenal shoeshine and I did not know that you two once lived together.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we did."
Ann Perkins,Thank you for catching him up on our history.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, that was an amazing shoeshine."
Chris Traeger,I can literally see my face in my shoes.
Chris Traeger,See you later!
Andy Dwyer,He didn't-- He didn't pay me.
Ann Perkins,Why are you hanging out with Chris?
Andy Dwyer,He just sat down.
Andy Dwyer,What am I supposed to do?
Andy Dwyer,He's my boss.
Ann Perkins,"No, he's not."
Andy Dwyer,He isn't?
Andy Dwyer,God dang it.
Andy Dwyer,I cannot figure out who my boss is.
Ann Perkins,"Andy, I like this guy."
Ann Perkins,"Please don't do anything weird, I beg you."
Ann Perkins,"I just started dating Chris, and I don't know how, but Andy's gonna screw it up."
Ann Perkins,Andy screws everything up.
Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, I bought him a fish and I don't want to get into it, but somehow that fish ended up dead in a cowboy boot."
Kelly Larson,"And combined, they have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide."
Kelly Larson,"Now, have you seen any of the Twilight movies?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I have not."
Kelly Larson,"Well, let me describe them to you shot for shot."
Kelly Larson,Movie number one.
Kelly Larson,Twilight.
Kelly Larson,We slowly pan up over a mossy log to see a deer drinking crystal clear water.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Kelly, this time capsule isn't just a barrel full of stuff that people like."
Leslie Knope,"It's about life in Pawnee at this moment in time, and there is nothing in Twilight that is specific to Pawnee."
Kelly Larson,"I disagree, okay?"
Kelly Larson,"The town of Forks, Washington is exactly like Pawnee, except for the climate and the vampires."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I have to say no.
Kelly Larson,I beg you to reconsider.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Kelly Larson,Then I'm gonna have to do this.
Leslie Knope,He brought handcuffs with him.
Leslie Knope,This whole thing was planned.
April Ludgate,I think it's kind of cool.
Leslie Knope,It's not cool.
Leslie Knope,"It's trespassing, and that is breaking the rules."
Leslie Knope,Cool people make the rules.
Leslie Knope,They don't break the rules.
Leslie Knope,"And if those kids want you to break the rules, they're not really your friends."
April Ludgate,"Whoa, who are you even talking about?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm just annoyed.
Leslie Knope,"But while we're on the subject, your friend Orrin, with the long black nails and the cloak?"
Leslie Knope,He concerns me.
April Ludgate,He's a genius.
Ron Swanson,I'll take care of this trespasser.
Ron Swanson,Give me 30 seconds.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna call security.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, can we push the meeting an hour?"
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office because we wouldn't put a copy of Twilight in the time capsule.
Ben Wyatt,Damn it.
Ben Wyatt,Again?
Kelly Larson,You look sad.
Tom Haverford,You look like a weird goon who's obsessed with a kid's book.
Kelly Larson,"It's a girl, isn't it?"
Kelly Larson,I can tell.
Kelly Larson,It's the look that Mike had on his face when Bella turned him down for the dance.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah?"
Tom Haverford,Is it?
Tom Haverford,What look did your mom have on her face when she realized her son was a complete failure?
Kelly Larson,"Okay, I'll be quiet."
Kelly Larson,But I do know something about heartbreak.
Kelly Larson,And you know who else does?
Tom Haverford,"Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds?"
Kelly Larson,No.
Kelly Larson,A little lady named Twilight author Stephenie Meyer.
Donna Meagle,Trust me.
Donna Meagle,You should listen to him.
Donna Meagle,Those books are good.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, I love any book about vampires, werewolves, monsters, zombies, sorcerers, beasties or time traveling romances."
Donna Meagle,"And if I had an hour alone with Robert Pattinson, he would forget all about Skinnylegs McGee."
Donna Meagle,I'll tell you that much.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, buddy, time is up."
Leslie Knope,Give us the keys.
Kelly Larson,They're hidden somewhere very far away.
Leslie Knope,Then we're gonna have to cut you loose.
Kelly Larson,Why?
Kelly Larson,I'm not doing anything wrong.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, you are."
Ron Swanson,You're trespassing.
Kelly Larson,"Well, the fact remains this is perfectly legal."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,You're trespassing.
Kelly Larson,"Look, I really don't want to cause any trouble, but I am not gonna leave until you put Twilight in the time capsule."
Kelly Larson,This muscleheaded Stormtrooper doesn't scare me.
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Artie."
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,Please!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,No!
Kelly Larson,Get him away from me!
Kelly Larson,I am very scared of you!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"If he wants to stay in there, I'll let him stay in there."
Leslie Knope,"In two hours, he's gonna be so hungry and freaked out, he's gonna be begging me to-- He brought a pillow."
Kelly Larson,"Hey, Leslie, I'm making some Sleepytime tea."
Kelly Larson,Do you want any?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, dude, wake up, man."
Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Twilight is dope.
Kelly Larson,I told you.
Tom Haverford,I couldn't put it down.
Tom Haverford,It was like she was peering into my soul.
Kelly Larson,"Sing it, friend."
Kelly Larson,Here.
Kelly Larson,Book two.
Kelly Larson,Twilight: New Moon.
Kelly Larson,Get cracking.
Tom Haverford,There's a second book?
Kelly Larson,And a third and a fourth.
Tom Haverford,No way.
Chris Traeger,It's fantastic.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I worked really hard.
Andy Dwyer,I did every pair that I could.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't know what to do with these.
Andy Dwyer,I think they're gloves.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,Those are sports sandals.
Chris Traeger,They are for adventure racing.
Chris Traeger,"They perfectly contour to the human foot, and the human foot is the ultimate technology."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, that is the coolest sentence I've ever heard somebody talk."
Chris Traeger,"So you love April, and she has a new boyfriend, right?"
Andy Dwyer,You got all of that from a picture?
Chris Traeger,"No, you told me yesterday."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I want to help you win her over."
Chris Traeger,Why do I want to help him?
Chris Traeger,Because he's a good person.
Chris Traeger,I love good people.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know who should wear these shoes?"
Andy Dwyer,Monkeys.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, this is an interesting turn of events."
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting."
Leslie Knope,"What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, how's this for a headline?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams."""
Leslie Knope,"God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story."
Chris Traeger,"The key to April's heart is within you, Andy."
Chris Traeger,You need to tap in to the aspects of your personality that she once found attractive to make yourself the best version of yourself.
Chris Traeger,What's great about you?
Andy Dwyer,I'm nice.
Chris Traeger,Good!
Chris Traeger,Nice.
Chris Traeger,What else?
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a band.
Chris Traeger,Band!
Chris Traeger,What else?
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Tom Haverford,Am I team Edward?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Do I share his concerns about turning Bella, though?"
Tom Haverford,Absolutely not.
Kelly Larson,"Edward's primary goal, at all times, is Bella's protection."
Leslie Knope,"Can you please, please be quiet?"
Kelly Larson,Sorry.
Kelly Larson,Sorry.
Kelly Larson,Let's keep it down.
Kelly Larson,Be considerate.
Kelly Larson,"Look at it this way, Tom."
Kelly Larson,Bella's love for Edward is being tested.
Tom Haverford,By Jacob?
Donna Meagle,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,Not exactly.
Tom Haverford,The Volturi?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst."
Kelly Larson,"You seem tense, Leslie."
Kelly Larson,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,Read Twilight?
Kelly Larson,Read Twilight.
Kelly Larson,Here.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks."
Tom Haverford,Sometimes I think she's in the Volturi.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Kelly."
Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Leslie."
Kelly Larson,"Hope you don't mind, I moved myself over to this pipe."
Kelly Larson,It's a little more comfortable.
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,Did you have a nice night?
Leslie Knope,Sleep well?
Kelly Larson,"It was all right, considering."
Leslie Knope,Picked you up some coffee.
Kelly Larson,Thank you so much.
Kelly Larson,"Well, you seem pretty chipper this morning."
Leslie Knope,"I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,You know what I did last night?
Kelly Larson,"Read Twilight, and it transformed your life and you're gonna put it in the time capsule?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I read the first 10 pages."
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't really get into it, though."
Leslie Knope,More of a Harry Potter girl myself.
Kelly Larson,What?
Leslie Knope,"But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this."
Leslie Knope,"Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straight-A student at King Philip Middle."
Leslie Knope,"She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?"
Leslie Knope,Is that why you did this?
Leslie Knope,To impress your daughter?
Kelly Larson,"Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her."
Kelly Larson,She loves Twilight.
Kelly Larson,"So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero."
Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.
Leslie Knope,You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.
Kelly Larson,I didn't want to drag her into it.
Kelly Larson,I'm sorry.
Kelly Larson,This is a mistake.
Kelly Larson,You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.
Leslie Knope,I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, no."
Ron Swanson,We don't negotiate with weirdoes.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what happened to, ""A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee""?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I can get Shauna on board."
Leslie Knope,It would make a great human interest story.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, that's a good point."
Leslie Knope,Then we shall bring the pipe to them.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Ben Wyatt,What does that mean?
Ron Swanson,Crackpot convention.
Leslie Knope,So that's what today's forum is for.
Leslie Knope,"We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule."
Leslie Knope,"Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items."
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Extra,I think we should put in the Bible.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Eduardo.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Eduardo."
Andy Dwyer,I want to apologize.
Andy Dwyer,Just because you're dating my soul mate doesn't give me any right to be a jerk to you.
Andy Dwyer,"I promise from now on, I'm just gonna be super nice to you."
Eduardo,Thank you for saying that.
Andy Dwyer,You're welcome.
Eduardo,What CDs are those?
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,My band.
Andy Dwyer,It's our latest album.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,You like music?
Andy Dwyer,What are you listening to?
Eduardo,The Smiths.
Eduardo,Very depressing!
Andy Dwyer,April's making you listen to that?
Eduardo,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,She's really into that indie stuff.
Andy Dwyer,I'm more of a Dave Matthews guy myself.
Eduardo,David Matthews!
Eduardo,Crash into Me!
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,I love that song.
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, here."
Andy Dwyer,Take one.
Andy Dwyer,Check us out.
Andy Dwyer,"We're amazing, so let me know how much you like us."
Eduardo,"Yeah, gracias."
Andy Dwyer,"That means ""thank you""?"
Eduardo,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,"So, we have one very moving case for Twilight."
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Two people for Twilight.
Marcia Langman,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Marcia Langman,"I'm Marcia Langman, from the Society for Family Stability Foundation."
Marcia Langman,This book contains pagan creatures and strong sexual overtones.
Marcia Langman,There are girls quivering.
Marcia Langman,"There are boys staring deeply into girls' eyes as they quiver, and so forth."
Marcia Langman,There really is a tremendous amount of quivering.
Marcia Langman,"It is anti-Christian, it is pro-quivering, and the government has no business promoting it."
Extra,I totally disagree.
Leslie Knope,"Well, now we have two people for Twilight."
Extra,Absolutely not.
Extra,I'm with the National Civil Liberties Association.
Extra,"That book actually contains overt Christian themes, and as such, has no business being associated with any government project."
Leslie Knope,"So too Christian, and not Christian enough?"
Leslie Knope,Do you see the irony here?
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight?"
Kelly Larson, No!
Kelly Larson, You promised!
Marcia Langman, You promised?
Marcia Langman, That's not fair!
Extra," Wait, it's not a question of fairness."
Marcia Langman,"Go back to Russia, commie!"
Kelly Larson,"Hey, you go back to Russia! You go back to wherever you came from!"
Marcia Langman,Why would I go to Russia? I have no interest in traveling to Russia. Can I just say that?
Leslie Knope,And who else?
Extra,"I would like to include my favorite book, Crazy from the Heat, the David Lee Roth story."
Leslie Knope," Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight."
Extra, I don't care about Twilight.
Extra, Why is this only about his favorite book? I want my favorite book in there.
Leslie Knope," Okay, I have an idea."
Leslie Knope, Two time capsules.
Leslie Knope," One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight."
Marcia Langman, No Twilight!
Kelly Larson,"Yes, Twilight!"
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Lucy, Hey.
Tom Haverford, Thanks for coming.
Lucy, I only have a second.
Lucy, I have to get to work.
Tom Haverford, Bella's going on her first hunt.
Tom Haverford, I just don't get why you broke up with me.
Tom Haverford," Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough? Like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward Bella Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?"
Lucy,Uh It's nothing to do with Twilight. It just didn't work out.
Tom Haverford," Okay? Well, what difference does it make? If we stayed together, you probably would have just dumped me for Ron."
Lucy," Actually, that's the reason."
Lucy," I believe you when you say that you're not in love with Wendy anymore, but you're definitely not cool with her dating Ron."
Lucy, You talk about it constantly.
Tom Haverford," Well, I can't help it, okay? I mean, he's so manly, and he's my boss."
Tom Haverford," Imagine if your boss was Angelina Jolie, and then one day, she just started dating your ex-boyfriend."
Tom Haverford, Wouldn't that freak you out a little bit?
Lucy,"Well, not if I had a great new boyfriend, dumbass."
Lucy," Look, Tom, I like you."
Lucy," You're really cute and you're funny, and you're small enough for me to throw you around."
Lucy," So if you ever work through this, then give me a call."
Extra," My grandmother lived in Pawnee for 60 years, and I wanna put her ashes in the time capsule."
Chance Frenlm," My cat, Turnip, was the greatest cat ever, and I'd like to put his ashes in the time capsule."
Leslie Knope," For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules."
Chance Frenlm, Except for Turnip! Except for Turnip!
Leslie Knope,No chanting.
Extra," Look, we don't know what the world is going to be like in 50 years."
Extra, We could all have been wiped out from disease or the flu.
Leslie Knope, So what's your suggestion?
Extra,I don't know. I'm just scared.
April Ludgate, Hey.
Eduardo,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,"I got two microphones, a four-track recorder and every bass tab to Dave Matthews ever."
Andy Dwyer," We're gonna jam for, like, nine hours."
Andy Dwyer, Is that cool?
Eduardo,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, All right.
Gretel, That's ridiculous.
Gretel," Now, why should the Bill of Rights be in the official time capsule, but this painting of my dog is in time capsule seven?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think pet paintings/ ashes are in time capsule four."
Extra," No, that's baseball cards."
Leslie Knope," No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia."
Kelly Larson," Honestly, Twilight could go in almost any of these categories."
Extra," Oh, shut up, Kelly!"
Kelly Larson,"Make me, Bob!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's take a 10-minute break! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope, This time capsule's tearing this town apart.
Leslie Knope, You're leaving soon.
Leslie Knope, Can I blame it on you in the press?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt," Well, I gotta say, I think it's kind of impressive."
Ben Wyatt, I've been to a lot of towns.
Ben Wyatt, Usually people don't care about anything.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, don't get me wrong."
Ben Wyatt," These people are weirdoes, but they're weirdoes who care."
Leslie Knope," Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope," I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry."
Leslie Knope," But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now."
Leslie Knope," ""Dear Pawnee of the future, congratulations."""
Leslie Knope," ""You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago."""
Leslie Knope," ""We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent what life was like in our town at that moment."""
Leslie Knope," ""Instead, you'll find only one item, a video recording of a public forum we held in order to determine just what those items would be."""
Leslie Knope," ""This is truly what life was like."""
Leslie Knope," ""A lot of people with a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in."""
Leslie Knope," ""So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity."""
Leslie Knope," ""And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle."""
Leslie Knope," ""A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow."""
Leslie Knope," ""He had one job to do."""
Leslie Knope," ""Sincerely, Pawnee of the past."""
Andy Dwyer,Is Eduardo coming?
April Ludgate,"No, he went back to Venezuela."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, that sucks."
Andy Dwyer, He was a really good bassist.
Andy Dwyer, I was actually starting to like him.
April Ludgate, I know.
April Ludgate, That's what made me start to hate him.
Andy Dwyer, Hey.
Andy Dwyer, Nice and band totally worked.
Ann Perkins, Have you enjoyed your time with Andy?
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, he's great."
Chris Traeger, And he told me how great you are.
Chris Traeger, And he told me that I would be crazy to let you get away.
Ann Perkins," He did, huh?"
Chris Traeger,He did.
Chris Traeger," And also, there is a pretzel stand over there that serves, literally, the best pretzel I've ever had."
Chris Traeger, Would you like one?
Ann Perkins,Absolutely.
Tom Haverford," Hey, guys."
Everyone," Hey, Tom."
Leslie Knope, Tom.
Tom Haverford," Listen, I've never seen this before, so I'd really appreciate it if no one, like, talked or texted or anything."
Tom Haverford, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Ooh! Hey.
Kelly Larson," Hey, Leslie, thanks for setting this up."
Tom Haverford," Dude, what did I just say?"
Kelly Larson,"Hey, I was the guy who introduced you to--"
Tom Haverford,How about you shut up?

,Season: 3 Episode: 04
Jack Cooper,Ron?
Jack Cooper,"Jack Cooper, from the Controller's Office."
Jack Cooper,Got a second?
Ron Swanson,"Sure, what can I do you for?"
Jack Cooper,"Frankly, this is a little awkward."
Jack Cooper,We've received this letter from a collection agency about an outstanding debt from the Pawnee Public Library.
Jack Cooper,It appears you have an overdue book.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, do I?"
Jack Cooper,"It's not the size of the boat, embracing Life with a Micropenis."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,My ex-wife Tammy likes to check in every so often and make sure I'm doing okay.
Ron Swanson,"And if I am, she tries to everything up."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I pre-dialed 911, so all you have to do is press send."
Ron Swanson,You're worrying over nothing.
Leslie Knope,"If she binds your hands and you can't reach your phone, just try to chew yourself free."
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,Whale tail.
Leslie Knope,She's flashing a whale tail.
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Leslie Knope,Abort.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Tammy."
Tammy 2,Oh!
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,I didn't see you come in.
Tammy 2,I was just checking myself for scoliosis.
Ron Swanson,And?
Tammy 2,Straight as an arrow.
Tammy 2,Just like somebody else I know.
Tammy 2,Jerky?
Ron Swanson,Call off the dogs.
Ron Swanson,"You and I both know that in my entire adult life, I have never checked a book out of the library."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, she's amazing."
Tammy 2,Ooh!
Tammy 2,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,I admit there was a time when that sort of behavior would've driven me wild.
Ron Swanson,"But I am in a healthy relationship now, Tammy."
Tammy 2,A relationship?
Tammy 2,With whom?
Ron Swanson,"A lovely, intelligent, self-possessed pediatric surgeon named Wendy."
Tammy 2,Sounds like a real whore.
Ron Swanson,Clear the late charges and cut the crap.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Tammy 2,"Good day, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Good Good day.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we're ordering them a total of 30 pizzas, so let's talk toppings."
Andy Dwyer,"Sausage, onion, and peppers."
Andy Dwyer,Scientifically proven to be the best toppings.
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Ben Wyatt,Should we throw in some salads for a healthy option?
Tom Haverford,"Wow, don't be such a Jerry, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Ben, these guys are cops, not ballerinas."
Leslie Knope,So we are throwing a little shindig for the police department because we're asking them to volunteer as security during the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know what it is about big outdoor gatherings that makes everyone want to urinate all over everything, but it does."
Leslie Knope,And they do.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, how about some calzones?"
Leslie Knope,Calzones are like pizzas but they're harder to eat.
Leslie Knope,"They're dumb, and so was that idea."
Ben Wyatt,Seriously?
Tom Haverford,This is embarrassing for you.
Wendy,Sorry to interrupt.
Wendy,"Ron, are you ready?"
Ron Swanson,"Absolutely, my dear."
Ron Swanson,"I am off to have a mid-morning pre-lunch with my lady friend, but I will be back in time for lunch."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Ron's girlfriend's pretty.
Andy Dwyer,Tom's ex-wife.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to see them together.
Tom Haverford,It's like they're rubbing it in my face.
Tom Haverford,All I can think about is Captain Mustache plowing my exwife.
Andy Dwyer,And you imagine he's wearing a cape while he's plowing her?
Tom Haverford,What?
Andy Dwyer,"No, just, Captain Mustache?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, if all you can think of is Ron, you know... Maybe put him in some tights and a cape, and then it would be funny."
Tom Haverford,Now I'm imagining a cape.
Chris Traeger,April?
April Ludgate,Did you call me?
Chris Traeger,I did call you.
Chris Traeger,Good ears.
April Ludgate,"Chris's assistant went back to Indianapolis, so he's borrowing me for a few days."
April Ludgate,Yay!
Chris Traeger,I'd like you to get me some more Postits.
Chris Traeger,I'd like them in multiple colors.
Chris Traeger,I'd like green.
Chris Traeger,I'd like yellow.
Chris Traeger,Do not buy orange.
Chris Traeger,I do not want orange.
Chris Traeger,I have plenty of orange.
April Ludgate,Got it.
April Ludgate,You want five million orange Postits.
Chris Traeger,That's hilarious.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wait!"
Chris Traeger,I have a Postit for you.
Chris Traeger,"It says, ""Great job!"""
Chris Traeger,Great job.
Chris Traeger,There you go.
Wendy,"They're getting really old, and I'm an only child."
Wendy,I just feel like the right thing to do is to move back home.
Ron Swanson,I'm sorry to see you go.
Ron Swanson,I've really come to think of you as a companion.
Wendy,"Hey, I don't suppose you'd want to move to Canada?"
Ron Swanson,Canada.
Ron Swanson,"No, I don't suppose I would."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I hate to nag, but shouldn't we be talking strategy, like, when to ask the chief for this huge critical favor?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I know exactly when we should do it.
Leslie Knope,"Post-pizza, pre-ice cream, between his third and fourth beer."
Leslie Knope,"He'll be full but not stuffed, tipsy but not drunk."
Leslie Knope,Should be around 9:00.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so you've thought this through."
Leslie Knope,Just sit tight.
Leslie Knope,I'll get you a beer.
Leslie Knope,"Can I have two beers, please?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you okay?"
Ron Swanson,Wendy and I are over.
Ron Swanson,She's moving back to Canada.
Ron Swanson,It's too bad.
Ron Swanson,I just taught her how to whittle.
Ron Swanson,She made me this tiny sharpened stick.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm gonna tell you what I tell all my girlfriends when they get dumped."
Leslie Knope,Men are dogs.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,That does not apply to this situation at all.
Ron Swanson,But thank you.
Ron Swanson,I appreciate it.
Chris Traeger,This is a disaster.
Chris Traeger,You're not into football?
Chris Traeger,I knew there was something wrong with you.
Chris Traeger,I knew it.
Chris Traeger,"I knew it, knew it, knew it."
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I haven't felt this good in years."
Ann Perkins,And it's not just because of the supplements he has me taking and the soluble fiber and the increase in regularity.
Ann Perkins,It's him.
Ann Perkins,"He's moving back to Indianapolis in a couple of weeks, which sucks."
Ann Perkins,"But if he asked me to move with him, I think I would."
Chris Traeger,I would like a local beer.
Chris Traeger,I'd like it in a bottle.
Chris Traeger,I'd like the bottle to be cold.
Ann Perkins,I would like a glass of white wine.
Ann Perkins,I would like it to be chardonnay.
Ann Perkins,And I would like that with one ice cube.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Chief Trumple?
Chief Trumple,"Hey, Knope."
Leslie Knope,You know Ben Wyatt from the State Budget Office.
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Chief Trumple,"Yeah, how's it going?"
Chief Trumple,Thanks for the party.
Chief Trumple,Good pizza.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"So, yeah, the pizza's dynamite, isn't it?"
Chief Trumple,I just said it was good pizza.
Chief Trumple,It's good.
Chief Trumple,Pizza's good.
Ben Wyatt,You-- You know what I like?
Ben Wyatt,Calzones.
Chief Trumple,What the hell is wrong with this guy?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,We'll check in with you later.
Leslie Knope,Take it easy.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, will do."
Leslie Knope,What is wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,I was getting somewhere with that.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, great small talk over there."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let me handle this."
Ben Wyatt,I get a little nervous with cops.
Leslie Knope,I'm in control.
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford's in the building.
Tammy 2,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what the hell are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,"Same thing you're doing, celebrating Pawnee's finest."
Tom Haverford,"I believe you know my date, Tammy Swanson."
Tammy 2,"Hiya, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"Hiya, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,Is seeing your ex-wife on my arm making you uncomfortable?
Tom Haverford,"Gee, I can't imagine why."
Tom Haverford,Or can I?
Tom Haverford,I like this song.
Tom Haverford,"Do you wanna dance, Tammy?"
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,Oh.
Tammy 2,Ah.
Leslie Knope,I know Tammy seems scary.
Leslie Knope,"But really, she's just a manipulative, psychotic, library book peddling, sex crazed shedemon."
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I think that's enough.
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Tammy 2,"Hi, Ron."
Tammy 2,"I was just tasting my new boyfriend, Glenn."
Tom Haverford,Tom.
Ron Swanson,"You don't know what you're mixed up in, son."
Ron Swanson,This isn't about you.
Ron Swanson,It's about me.
Tom Haverford,Typical Ron Swanson.
Tom Haverford,Always thinking about yourself.
Tom Haverford,Maybe we like each other.
Tammy 2,"Yeah, maybe we do."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Let's take it easy.
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, leave him out of this."
Tammy 2,"So it's okay for you to have a girlfriend, but I'm not supposed to see anybody?"
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman!"
Ron Swanson,Just crawl back into the dank hole you came from and leave my friends alone.
Cop,"Okay, okay."
Cop,Let's settle down.
Cop,What seems to be the problem?
Cop,What seems to be the problem?
Cop,Is there a problem here?
Cop,Basically what we had here was a dispute of a domestic nature.
Cop,"White male, 40, 45."
Cop,Caucasian male.
Cop,Stocky build.
Cop,"Approximately 5'10""."
Cop,Verbal altercation transpired at approximately 8:55 P.M. with a female unsub.
Cop,Appears to be slightly intoxicated.
Cop,Claims to be an ex-spouse.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Cop,Real piece of work.
Leslie Knope,"I know why you're doing this, and you're making a huge mistake."
Tom Haverford,"Fight fire with fire, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"He dates my ex, I date his."
Leslie Knope,Ron and Wendy aren't even dating anymore.
Leslie Knope,She's moving back to Canada.
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hey."
Leslie Knope,What's happening here?
Tammy 2,Ron and I are going to get a cup of coffee and talk things out.
Ron Swanson,It's time for Tammy and me to bury the hatchet once and for all.
Ron Swanson,Everything will be fine.
Chief Trumple,It's been like this for hours.
Ron Swanson,Right there.
Ron Swanson,Right there.
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Swanson!"
Leslie Knope,Snap out of it!
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,Congratulate us.
Tammy 2,Ron's got one just like it on his penis.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,What the hell happened to you?
Ron Swanson,Well... Here you go.
Tammy 2,Rock and roll!
Tammy 2,"Yeah, baby!"
Ron Swanson,I got it!
Extra,You may now kiss the bride.
Ron Swanson,It's been kind of a crazy night.
Tammy 2,"Come back, come back."
Chris Traeger,"April, could you come in here a second?"
Chris Traeger,"April, way to come in."
Chris Traeger,Great initiative.
April Ludgate,You called me in.
Chris Traeger,"Listen, could you please call Ann Perkins and tell her that I will be unable to enjoy lunch with her today, as I am just swamped."
Chris Traeger,All day.
April Ludgate,Copy that.
April Ludgate,"Hi, Ann."
April Ludgate,This is April.
April Ludgate,I'm just calling to let you know that Chris can't make lunch today.
April Ludgate,I knew you wouldn't care.
April Ludgate,Goodbye.
Chief Trumple,They started having sex at the court house.
Chief Trumple,We had no choice.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, I completely understand."
Leslie Knope,"Chief, I need to ask you a huge favor."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Ron is a good man who just got caught up in something terrible.
Leslie Knope,And I was hoping that maybe you would reduce his charges and release him into my custody.
Chief Trumple,All right.
Chief Trumple,But keep him away from that crazy librarian.
Leslie Knope,I'll do my best.
Chief Trumple,"In fact, I don't want him within 500 feet of the library."
Leslie Knope,That's good advice for all of us.
Chief Trumple,Nothing but trouble there.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks a lot, bro."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop."
Ron Swanson,Take me back to Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"For the millionth time, no."
Ben Wyatt,"That was not the favor we needed to ask for, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"If we don't get the police for the Harvest Festival, there is no Harvest Festival."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out later.
Ron Swanson,Can you turn the radio off?
Ron Swanson,This is our song.
Ben Wyatt,Your song is Dancing on the Ceiling by Lionel Richie?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, wow, look at that."
Ben Wyatt,You shaved off part of your mustache.
Ben Wyatt,That's lovely.
Ron Swanson,I didn't shave it off.
Ron Swanson,It rubbed off.
Ron Swanson,From friction.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Ron Swanson, this is an intervention."
Leslie Knope,You have been spending the last 24 hours sipping on joy juice and tripping on Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the people in this room are your methadone."
Leslie Knope,And we're here to get you clean.
Jerry Gergich,Congratulations!
Jerry Gergich,"Holy matrimony, there's the man of the hour."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what is this?"
Jerry Gergich,That is the set of tumblers that I got from the registry.
Leslie Knope,This is an intervention.
Jerry Gergich,I thought you said on the phone it was a reception.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's begin."
Donna Meagle,"I would like to address the goofy Iooking, dirty kimono wearing, cornrowed clown in the room."
Donna Meagle,"If you see Ron Swanson, can you give him this message?"
Donna Meagle,You used to be a man.
Donna Meagle,You need to get your house in order.
Donna Meagle,"Look, I love you like a brother, but right now, I hate you like my actual brother, LeVondrious, who I hate."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, you look great."
Tom Haverford,Your skin is glowing.
Tom Haverford,I've never seen you so happy.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sit down."
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, I do not really understand what is going on right now."
Andy Dwyer,"But no matter what, you must keep going."
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,You must stop.
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,Follow your dreams.
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Ann Perkins,April?
Ann Perkins,What are you doing here?
April Ludgate,I work for your boyfriend.
April Ludgate,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,"I came to see why Chris stood me up for lunch, but I think I just figured it out."
April Ludgate,Because he doesn't like you.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm pretty sure that's not it."
April Ludgate,Actually it's because I didn't call you deliberately.
April Ludgate,"Which, if you ask me, is a fireable offense."
April Ludgate,So I would tell him that.
April Ludgate,"Also, he's not into you sexually."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger,Literally two of my favorite people on earth.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry that I had to cancel lunch.
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Ann Perkins,It's not a problem.
Ann Perkins,April here was very apologetic on the phone.
Ann Perkins,She also sent me flowers.
Chris Traeger,April.
Chris Traeger,Nice touch.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ron."
Ron Swanson,It's Ron.
Ron Swanson,"If you're watching this, it means that once again you have danced with the devil."
Ron Swanson,"Right now, you're probably thinking, ""Tammy's changed."""
Ron Swanson,"""We'll be happy together."""
Ron Swanson,But you're only thinking that because she's a monstrous parasite who entered through your privates and lodged herself in your brain.
Ron Swanson,So you have two choices.
Ron Swanson,"One, get rid of Tammy, or two, lobotomy and castration."
Ron Swanson,Choose wisely.
Ron Swanson,You stupid.
Ron Swanson,This is a waste of time.
Ron Swanson,You people have no idea what you're talking about.
Leslie Knope,That was you on the tape.
Leslie Knope,That was you talking.
Tammy 2,Ron?
Tammy 2,Ron!
Tammy 2,Ron.
Tammy 2,There you are.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,"God, please."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't do that."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, it's done, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy and I are in love, and we're gonna start a family together."
Ron Swanson,"In fact, she's ovulating."
Ron Swanson,"So if you'll excuse us, we're heading off on our honeymoon."
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Ron Swanson,We're gonna spend 11 days in my cabin in the woods.
Tammy 2,We bought 10 cases of Gatorade and a 40-pound bag of peanuts for energy.
Ron Swanson,Give me it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah."
Tammy 2,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,"Ann and I are headed out and I just wanted to thank you for everything today, and I will see you tomorrow."
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Chris."
Andy Dwyer,Ron Swanson has sent me over to deliver to you this document.
Chris Traeger,"""To whom it may concern, dear Chris, there is an emergency regarding the Parks Department, and April may just be the only person who can help."""
Chris Traeger,"""I can't get into details because it's superclassified."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please release April back to us permanently."""
Chris Traeger,"""God bless America."""
Chris Traeger,"""Love, Bert Macklin, FBI."""
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, bye."
Chris Traeger,"April, listen."
Chris Traeger,"If you don't want to work for me, I'm not gonna force you."
Chris Traeger,You didn't have to do this.
Andy Dwyer,She didn't do that.
Andy Dwyer,That was-- I think it sounds like it was Macklin's call.
Chris Traeger,"Look, I get it."
Chris Traeger,"You're young, and trying isn't cool."
Chris Traeger,But I think you're smart.
Chris Traeger,"I'm gonna be going back to Indianapolis soon, and I think you should come work for me."
April Ludgate,"Wow, move all the way to Indianapolis, so I can pick up your vitamins and supplements."
Chris Traeger,Everybody starts somewhere.
Chris Traeger,"You'll travel, and you will meet interesting people."
Chris Traeger,Think about it.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,I will.
Ann Perkins,Apparently he wants April to move to Indianapolis with him.
Ann Perkins,So that's something.
Leslie Knope,I hope you're happy.
Tom Haverford,"Look, I just wanted to show him what it felt like to have your exwife date someone you know."
Tom Haverford,Whatever happened after that is not my fault.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you did a really crappy thing, and I think deep down, you know that."
Leslie Knope,Whatever happens to Ron Swanson is on you.
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, chief."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry to interrupt.
Chief Trumple,"Hey, calzone boy, what's up?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, here's hoping that that nickname doesn't stick."
Ben Wyatt,Right?
Ben Wyatt,But that's not why I'm here.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie Knope asked you for a favor the other day, but the real favor we need is much bigger."
Chief Trumple,"You mean, like calzone size?"
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,We need the Pawnee police force to volunteer as security during the upcoming Harvest Festival.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the city won't let us throw the festival unless Say no more."
Chief Trumple,Just send me a schedule of how many officers you need and when.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Just like that?
Chief Trumple,Leslie Knope gets as many favors as she needs.
Ben Wyatt,Can I ask why?
Chief Trumple,Because she's the kind of a person who uses favors to help other people.
Chief Trumple,"And also, my buddy Dave was the crankiest bastard in the department till he started dating Leslie."
Ben Wyatt, So she-- Okay.
Ben Wyatt, Are they still dating or--
Chief Trumple,No. Moved to San Diego a year ago.
Ben Wyatt," Was it a serious thing, or..."
Chief Trumple,What do you care? You a pervert?
Ben Wyatt,"Nope, nope."
Ben Wyatt, I'm all good.
Ben Wyatt, Everything's fine.
Ben Wyatt, This is fine.
Tammy 2, Don't think I won't do it.
Tammy 2, I'll wear this to work.
Tammy 2," All right, one more."
Tammy 2," What's in here, huh? A new library card?"
Extra,Read the name.
Tammy 2," ""Tammy Swanson Swanson."""
Tammy 2,"You guys, that's amazing."
Ron Swanson," Well, you about ready to go, my love?"
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tom Haverford," Wait, wait, Ron! Stop!"
Ron Swanson,Tom?
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, what the hell? Don't do it."
Tom Haverford, She doesn't love you.
Ron Swanson, You don't know what you're talking about.  What are you doing here?
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I do, okay? When I asked her to be my date, she cackled for a full minute and said, and I quote, ""Anything to make Ron miserable."""
Tom Haverford,"It's not real, man."
Tom Haverford, She's just messing with you.
Tammy 2," He's lying, Ron."
Tammy 2," Stay out of this, Glenn."
Tom Haverford, It's Tom! And I'm not lying.
Tom Haverford, I'm not gonna let you destroy Ron.
Tom Haverford, You're just gonna have to-- Ow! Ow!
Tammy 2,"He's attacking me, Ron! Kill him! Yeah! Do your worst, Glenn! You're gonna have to do better than that."
Tammy 2," Why are you hitting yourself, Glenn? Stop hitting yourself."
Ron Swanson," Tammy, that's enough!"
Tammy 2,"What? Hey, baby."
Ron Swanson, You almost had me.
Ron Swanson, Again.
Ron Swanson," But seeing you pick on this pathetic, defenseless little man..."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Ron Swanson,Reminded me what kind of a monster you are.
Tammy 2, You're a joke.
Tammy 2, You're not even a man anymore.
Tammy 2," Oh, and by the way, last night, I faked four out of the seven."
Ron Swanson, So did I.
Ron Swanson," Let's go, son."
Ben Wyatt, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Sorry about the whole mess.
Leslie Knope," The crisis has been averted, so let's go talk to the chief."
Ben Wyatt, I already talked to him.
Ben Wyatt," They'll give us the hours we need, no problem."
Leslie Knope, Great.
Leslie Knope, What a relief.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Ben Wyatt," Hey, are you hungry? I haven't eaten."
Leslie Knope," You know, yeah."
Leslie Knope," There's a really great calzone place over in ""Idiotville."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Down on ""Terrible Idea Avenue."""
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt, That's weird.
Ben Wyatt," 'Cause I thought it was on Beating a Dead Horse Boulevard."""
Leslie Knope,Calzones are pointless.
Leslie Knope, They're just pizza that's harder to eat.
Leslie Knope, No one likes them.
Leslie Knope," Good day, sir."
Ben Wyatt," Leslie, I-- You know, I..."
Leslie Knope,I'm just kidding.
Leslie Knope, Let's go.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt, That was funny.
Ron Swanson, High and tight.
Tom Haverford, Do you think it's gonna leave a scar?
Ron Swanson,"Tom, women like scars."
Ron Swanson," Shows you survived an attack, and they'll assume the attack was from a man."
Tom Haverford," Sorry, Ron, about everything."
Ron Swanson, To true love.
Ron Swanson, May we both find it.
Tom Haverford, I'll drink to that.
Tom Haverford, Nice glasses.
Ron Swanson, Wedding present from Jerry.
Tom Haverford, You're not gonna return them?
Ron Swanson,"Nah, too much hassle."

Ron Swanson,I found this typewriter next to the courtyard dumpster.
Ron Swanson,An old Underwood 5 with original carriage return.
Ron Swanson,"Took her home, polished her up and bought a brand new ribbon off of electronicbay.com"
April Ludgate,"Okay, somebody has got to do something."
April Ludgate,I'm getting a cluster headache.
Jerry Gergich,He's leaving.
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,I've got to throw it away.
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm not."
Tom Haverford,It weighs a billion tons.
Jerry Gergich,"What is he typing, anyway?"
Donna Meagle,"""If you sons of bitches try to remove this typewriter, I'll kill you."""
Ron Swanson,I'm going to type every word I know!

Ron Swanson,Butthole.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but these interviews are more important than we thought."
Ben Wyatt,"Harvest Fest is two weeks away, and awareness is still pretty low."
Leslie Knope,"Boy, 35%?"
Ben Wyatt,It's actually 34.2%
Leslie Knope,"""34.2%"""
Leslie Knope,"I'm Ben, the numbers robot."
Ben Wyatt,It's just an exact calculation.
Tom Haverford,"""It's just an exact calculation."""
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,"So, we're doing a huge media blitz to publicize the Harvest Festival, and we've got TV, newspaper, radio. And I even called Oprah."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I tried to call Oprah."
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get her number.
Leslie Knope,"I'm putting it out there, like The Secret."
Leslie Knope,"And hopefully, she'll call me."
Leslie Knope,Our first interview is at 93.7 FM with Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Tom Haverford,Crazy Ira and The Douche.
Leslie Knope,They are Pawnee's most hilarious drive time radio guys.
Tom Haverford,So much better than Tubby Tony and the Papaya.
Tom Haverford,Am I right?
Leslie Knope,They're seriously so funny.
Ann Perkins,Is this right?
Chris Traeger,"This feels almost perfect, but I don't think your core has maximized elasticity."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"I'll come back, if you guys are being weird."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,"You're exactly the person that I most want to talk to, right at this moment."
Chris Traeger,And lunge.
Chris Traeger,Have you given my offer any more thought?
April Ludgate,What exactly would happen if I said yes?
Chris Traeger,"Well, you would work at the state house."
Chris Traeger,"You would coordinate my professional and personal schedule, and we would give you a small relocation fee for your move to Indianapolis."
April Ludgate,That sounds boring.
April Ludgate,But I have nothing keeping me here.
April Ludgate,Do you have Internet in your office?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
April Ludgate,"Fine, I'll do it."
Chris Traeger,That is literally the best news that I've heard all day.
Ann Perkins,"Unlike April, I still do not know what my future holds with Chris."
Ann Perkins,And it's starting to bum me out.
Ann Perkins,I need some more vitamin D.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Crazy.
Andy Dwyer,What was that meeting about?
April Ludgate,It turns out Chris is my real dad.
Andy Dwyer,I think you're lying.
Andy Dwyer,I think I know what that meeting was about.
Andy Dwyer,You can't go to Indianapolis.
Andy Dwyer,There's got to be something that I can do to convince you how much I care about you.
Andy Dwyer,"Tell me your least favorite things you have to do every day, and I'll do them for a month."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"If you do everything I hate for a month, then I might begin to think about the possibility of thinking about maybe staying."
Andy Dwyer,That's all I have to hear.
Andy Dwyer,You won't live to regret this.
April Ludgate,"Unless Andy can unkiss Ann, then I'm not going to change my mind."
April Ludgate,"But if he wants to take my dumb sister to her dumb dance class, then I'm not going to dumb stop him."
Narrator,"Crazy Ira and The Douche, 93.7"
Crazy Ira,You know why I'd never be an astronaut?
Crazy Ira,Two words.
Crazy Ira,Space farts.
Crazy Ira,You can't roll down the window of the shuttle.
Crazy Ira,"Am I right, folks?"
The Douche,"Houston, we have a-- What do you think about that, Neil Armstrong?"
Extra,"That's one small for man, one giant for mankind."
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,Switching gears here now.
The Douche,"We've got Leslie Knope and Tom ""Haverfart"" and Ben Wyatt."
The Douche,And they're in the hizzy to talk about an upcoming event called the Harvest Festival.
Leslie Knope,"Well, The Douche, it's a Pawnee tradition, and it's where fun meets awesome."
Leslie Knope,Meets agriculture.
Leslie Knope,"And it is going to be next month, right here in Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And spoiler alert, it's going to have the best corn maze ever."
Crazy Ira,"You lost your virginity in a corn maze, didn't you, Douche?"
The Douche,That's right.
The Douche,To your mom.
Extra,Crazy Ira!
Extra,Clean your room!
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be hay rides.
The Douche,"""Hey, ride me,"" is what Crazy Ira's mom said."
Crazy Ira,Stop it!
Tom Haverford,"China Joe, you are a poet."
Extra,My bird is missing.
Extra,I need a permit to post signs.
Andy Dwyer,Let me just look for that form.
Extra,There's no time!
Extra,He can fly!
Andy Dwyer,Nine things April hates to do.
Andy Dwyer,"Number one, run the permits desk for an hour."
Andy Dwyer,That's no problem.
Andy Dwyer,"I eat ""running the permits desk for an hour"" for breakfast."
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,That's-- Ow.
Extra,Henry.
Extra,Stop it.
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, Henry."
Andy Dwyer,Cute kid.
Ron Swanson,Andy.
Ron Swanson,Got a sec?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Extra,Henry.
Ron Swanson,"Why are you working the permits desk, and why was that child clubbing your nuggets?"
Andy Dwyer,"I'm trying to stop April from taking a job with Chris, so I'm doing everything she hates doing for the next month."
Ron Swanson,That's going to work?
Andy Dwyer,She said it might.
Andy Dwyer,"But it's all I've got, man."
Ron Swanson,Give me the list.
Ron Swanson,I'll help you.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,"No, I don't care about their relationship."
Ron Swanson,I just don't want to lose April.
Ron Swanson,I would never be able to find a worse assistant.
Crazy Ira,Okay.
Crazy Ira,"Thanks, Leslie."
Crazy Ira,"But you know, what we really want to do today is have a chat with Ben Wyatt, here."
Crazy Ira,"Come on, Ben."
The Douche,"Come on, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,I'm more of a behind the scenes kind of guy.
Crazy Ira,"Well, it's either come with us or get in the spank chair."
Crazy Ira,"So, maybe it's time for an interview."
Crazy Ira,"Come on, everybody, give him a hand."
The Douche,Come on!
The Douche,"Come on over, Ben."
The Douche,Yeah.
Crazy Ira,"So, this guy, Ben Wyatt. We're looking him up on AltaVista."
Crazy Ira,"He's from some hick town, Partridge, Minnesota."
Crazy Ira,"And when he's 18, he's elected mayor."
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
The Douche,"Yeah, he's 18, becomes the mayor, and then blows the whole budget on an ice skating rink."
The Douche,City goes bankrupt.
Crazy Ira,Joke!
Crazy Ira,Get out of there!
Crazy Ira,"What did you call it again, bro?"
Crazy Ira,What was it called?
Crazy Ira,Say it.
Ben Wyatt,Ice Town.
Ben Wyatt,I was a kid.
Ben Wyatt,And when you-- You end up getting out there and there's a--
The Douche,I really wish you guys could see this guy right now. He is drenched in sweat.
Leslie Knope,There's also going to be ponies at the Harvest Festival.
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,Let's take a caller from Douche Nation.
The Douche,All right.
The Douche,"Talk to me, caller."
Extra,"What's up, guys?"
Extra,Just douching over here in Eagleton.
Tom Haverford,Sweet.
Extra,Seems like 18 is pretty young for a mayor.
Extra,"What were you, like, 12?"
Ben Wyatt,"The funny... When I guess... The fortunate... Can we just, sort of..."
The Douche,"Game over, man."
Extra,Game over.
Tom Haverford,"Nice job, man."
Tom Haverford,Was that your first time talking to other people?
Tom Haverford,Because it came off that way.
Tom Haverford,You embarrassed me in front of The Douche.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,I just I haven't had to deal with that mayor stuff for 17 years.
Ben Wyatt,I guess I'm not totally over it.
Leslie Knope,No worries.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it was just a bump in the road."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Fortunately, the Lesliemobile is an all terrain vehicle."
Leslie Knope,"So, everything involving Ben is fine."
Leslie Knope,I just need to talk to you in private about something different that is not Ben related.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, good job."
Tom Haverford,Your boy's a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but we need him."
Leslie Knope,"If they ask us about the budget, he's our numbers guy."
Tom Haverford,"Well, we should just slap a pair of RayBans on a calculator, because that would be way more charming."
Leslie Knope,I'll do the newspaper interview.
Leslie Knope,You and Ben do Channel Four.
Leslie Knope,Perd Hapley is a big softie.
Leslie Knope,It'll be a puff piece.
Leslie Knope,He can do it.
The Douche,"So, how are you liking Pawnee?"
Ben Wyatt,There are a lot of cars.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, not too many."
Ben Wyatt,Trucks and stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"But, you know Cool."
The Douche,"Good talk, Ice Town."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,"Who knew that watercress, garbanzo beans and walnuts could complement each other so well?"
Ann Perkins,"Good dressing, too, right?"
Ann Perkins,Flaxseed and agave.
Ann Perkins,Same basic ingredients as bird feed.
Chris Traeger,I'm just going to come right out and say it.
Chris Traeger,I want to define your bagua.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What's that?
Chris Traeger,It's a feng shui term.
Chris Traeger,The energy in this house is a little stale.
Chris Traeger,But I think I can redefine your flow in a very positive way.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,I'm not really attached to the way this stuff is arranged.
Ann Perkins,Or the stuff itself.
Ann Perkins,"Or this house, even, really."
Chris Traeger,"Great, let's do it."
Ann Perkins,Am I not being obvious enough?
Ann Perkins,I feel like I'm being obvious.
Leslie Knope,This just in.
Leslie Knope,"Harvest Festival more like ""Harvest Bestival."""
Leslie Knope,"The Parks Department has planted the seeds, and now, they're harvesting the rewards."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You done?
Leslie Knope,They'll put the fun in funnel cake.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I'm done."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Tell me about Ben Wyatt.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"He works for the state government, and he's been coming to advise us about our budget."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Come on, Leslie."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,The Douche blew this story wide open.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Ben Wyatt bankrupts a town and then comes to Pawnee to tell us how to spend our money?
Leslie Knope,"There's no story here, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,He's just a dedicated civil servant who is doing whatever he can to make sure that this is the best Harvest Festival ever.
Leslie Knope,"And he's easy on the eyes, too."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What exactly is the nature of your relationship with him?
Leslie Knope,Strictly professional.
Leslie Knope,Just friends.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"So, are you colleagues or are you friends?"
Leslie Knope,We are colleagues with benefits.
Leslie Knope,We're colleagues who benefit from the fact that we're also friends.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,I think I need to go.
Leslie Knope,"But, thank you so much, and as always, everything I said is off the record."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Bye.
Ron Swanson,What's the next task?
Andy Dwyer,We have to write her grandmother a thank you note for a birthday check.
Andy Dwyer,"It has to be really good, too, because it's five months late."
Ron Swanson,Never written a thank you note before.
Ron Swanson,This will be fun.
Ron Swanson,What does she call her?
Andy Dwyer,Gamma.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Nanna.
Andy Dwyer,Or Nana.
Andy Dwyer,Gizmo.
Andy Dwyer,Something like that.
Andy Dwyer,This is for your Gizmo.
Andy Dwyer,I think you'll find it's pretty good.
April Ludgate,"""Dear April's grandmother"" I said grandfather."
Andy Dwyer,Oops.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,"""You are a beautiful and amazing woman."""
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,"""I hope someday, I can become half the woman you are."""
April Ludgate,He's a man.
April Ludgate,"""Thank you for the 500 dollars."""
April Ludgate,It was 5 dollars.
April Ludgate,"""Enjoy the Mouse Rat CD."""
April Ludgate,He is deaf.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you want me to make those changes, or is it good?"
Tom Haverford,"Before we do this next interview, there's a little secret I want to let you in on."
Tom Haverford,"It's called the ""Haverford Schmooze."""
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I was just caught off guard."
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Tom Haverford,Three easy steps.
Tom Haverford,"Smile, friendly physical contact and flattery."
Tom Haverford,"""Hey, Perd."""
Tom Haverford,"""Was your dad RoboCop?"""
Tom Haverford,"""Because your arms are guns."""
Ben Wyatt,RoboCop didn't have guns for arms.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,"That's so not the point, you nerd."
Ben Wyatt,Just saying.
Ben Wyatt,Why are we at a mall?
Tom Haverford,We're getting you a new suit.
Tom Haverford,I've let this go on long enough.
Ben Wyatt,I like this suit.
Tom Haverford,"You shouldn't, because it looks like garbage."
Ben Wyatt,Your suit looks more like garbage.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Because Brooks Brothers Boys doesn't make garbage.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,This next thing is a photography class assignment.
Andy Dwyer,Can you figure that out?
Ron Swanson,"""Encapsulate the spirit of melancholy."""
Andy Dwyer,Melancholy.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,A sad desk.
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,Sad wall.
Ron Swanson,It's art.
Ron Swanson,Anything is anything.
Andy Dwyer,Right on.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to go drop this off and pick up the mail.
Ron Swanson,Sad floor.
Andy Dwyer,"It does look sad, kind of."
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry for stepping on you, floor."
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,You got Andy doing all your work for you?
April Ludgate,"Yes, but he said he wanted to do it."
April Ludgate,I'm only doing it because I'm getting him back--
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I don't care."
Donna Meagle,I got something to add to your list.
Donna Meagle,Yup.
Donna Meagle,There we go.
Donna Meagle,That's the stuff.
Andy Dwyer,April really does this every day?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Work the heel.
Jerry Gergich,"Andy, can I be next?"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,I have got a corn so big you could slap butter on it.
Perd Hapley,Welcome to Ya' Heard?
Perd Hapley,With Perd.
Perd Hapley,I'm Perd Hapley.

Perd Hapley,Ben Wyatt and Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"What up, Perd?"
Tom Haverford,Big fan.
Ben Wyatt,"Me, too, Perd."
Ben Wyatt,What up?
Perd Hapley,"The thing about this first question is, I'd like to ask you about the Harvest Festival."
Tom Haverford,"Perd, it's going to be amazing."
Tom Haverford,"Carnival rides, games Sweetums is even building a plussized roller coaster for some of Pawnee's obese thrill seekers."
Tom Haverford,You must be this wide to ride.
Perd Hapley,Wow.
Perd Hapley,That's going to be a pretty big roller coaster.
Tom Haverford,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,How did it go?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were some sticky moments."
Tom Haverford,Let's go to the videotape.
Ben Wyatt,Look.
Ben Wyatt,Who hasn't had gay thoughts?
Ben Wyatt,Who?
Perd Hapley,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you know, sometimes, I feel like I might need glasses."
Ben Wyatt,Is there a bird in here?
Ben Wyatt,"I swear, I keep seeing a bird in this studio."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe that's all there is to it.
Leslie Knope,How did this happen?
Tom Haverford,"He was fine until Perd started asking him about the ""boy mayor"" stuff."
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Leslie Knope,You look psychotic.
Ben Wyatt,I was 18 when I was elected mayor.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"So, excuse me for that."
Ben Wyatt,Cindy Eckert had just turned me down for senior prom.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know how that I should call her.
Ben Wyatt,I should.
Ben Wyatt,"No, I shouldn't."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm not going to.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm proud of myself for that.
Tom Haverford,"And then, he talked about feeling up Cindy Eckert for the first time for about five minutes."
Tom Haverford,"And then, the show ended."
Tom Haverford,"As did our careers and, probably, Harvest Fest."
Ron Swanson,Boom.
Ron Swanson,Sadness.
Ron Swanson,That's the one.
Andy Dwyer,Natalie!
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"It's me, Andy."
Natalie Ludgate,You're an hour and a half late.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,I had to massage a ton of feet.
Andy Dwyer,Super sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Get in.
Andy Dwyer,I need to do everything on April's list or she's not going to go out with me.
Natalie Ludgate,You're into April?
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,We'll talk about it in the car.
Natalie Ludgate,Hold on.
Natalie Ludgate,I'll get my books.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,Call me.
Leslie Knope,That should be some damage control.
Leslie Knope,I'm having dinner with Perd Hapley.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, what do we have?"
Tom Haverford,I've gotten calls from a dozen businesses thinking about pulling their sponsorships.
Tom Haverford,Sweetums might cancel the FatCoaster.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,We still have the Pawnee Today interview.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, is it too late to cancel?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's too late to cancel.
Leslie Knope,Joan Callamezzo runs this town.
Leslie Knope,"But Ben, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope,You're not going in front of the camera.
Ben Wyatt,Fine with me.
Police Officer,Are you trying to lure this young lady into your van?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"But she's being really difficult about it, and it's actually not my van."
Andy Dwyer,I stole it from a friend of mine.
Andy Dwyer,"I technically shouldn't be even driving, because my license is crazy expired."
Police Officer,That's Dwyer.
Police Officer,DWYER.
Andy Dwyer,Dude!
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,I've got to get out of here!
Andy Dwyer,"Natalie, tell this guy you know me."
Tom Haverford,Joan?
Tom Haverford,I thought you were Jennifer Aniston filming a movie here.
Tom Haverford,"Joan, let's make a pact, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"If we're both still single in an hour, let's get married."
Joan Callamezzo,"Tom, I'm already married."
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,To Seal.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I confused you with Heidi Klum again.
Tom Haverford,"See you later, Joan."
Tom Haverford,That's how it's done.
Joan Callamezzo,"Hello, and welcome to Pawnee Today."
Joan Callamezzo,I'm Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,"Today's guest is Leslie Knope, who is here to tell us how this year's Harvest Festival is going to bankrupt the city."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Joan, actually, there's a lot of false information flying around."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is--
Joan Callamezzo,Jumping right in.
Joan Callamezzo,That's rude.
Leslie Knope,I just want everyone to know what an extraordinary event this is going to be.
Joan Callamezzo,But at what cost?
Joan Callamezzo,How many cities does Ben Wyatt need to destroy before he's put behind bars?
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt has done nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope,You know?
Leslie Knope,"If you want to ask him questions, let's go for it, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Just ask any question about his past or present.
Leslie Knope,Just get it over with.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, let's get up here."
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"We'll just ask him a bunch of questions, and then, we'll get everything cleared and out of the way."
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Leslie Knope,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Let's take some calls, Joan."
Joan Callamezzo,Why don't you?
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," Caller, are you there?"
Caller,"Yeah, how can you justify raising taxes for something that will hurt the town?"
Ben Wyatt,I... For...
Leslie Knope,"Just to add to what Ben's stammering about, we aren't going to raise taxes."
Leslie Knope," So, that's that."
Leslie Knope, Next caller?
Ron Swanson," Do you fish, April?"
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate, Fish are gross.
Ron Swanson, Let me give you a piece of fishing advice.
Ron Swanson," I said I don't When you have a fish on the line, you don't just drag it behind the boat."
Ron Swanson, You either reel it in or you cut him loose.
Ron Swanson," Especially if he's a nice fish with a big, lovable fish heart."
April Ludgate, You don't know what you're talking about.
Ron Swanson, Maybe not.
Ron Swanson, Maybe you really do hate Andy.
Ron Swanson, Maybe moving to Indianapolis just to get revenge on him is a really good idea.
Ron Swanson, What do I know?
Chris Traeger, You are going to love this. Verosian tea really supercharges the bacteria in your colon.
Chris Traeger," Plus, it smells interesting."
Chris Traeger, Waft it.
Ann Perkins," Are we actually ever going to drink it, or we're just going to sniff it? I love sniffing."
Ann Perkins, Don't get me wrong.
Chris Traeger, You are hilarious.
Ann Perkins," So, you're leaving soon."
Chris Traeger," Back to Indianapolis briefly, and then, on to a town called Snerling, Indiana, for several months."
Ann Perkins, Never heard of it.
Chris Traeger, It's quite small.
Chris Traeger, The cows outnumber the people forty to one.
Chris Traeger, It sounds amazing.
Ann Perkins, I like you a lot.
Ann Perkins, I love spending time with you.
Chris Traeger," And I thoroughly enjoy you, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins, I just think we need to talk about what that means for us.
Ann Perkins, I don't want to be clingy.
Chris Traeger," No, no, no."
Chris Traeger, Please.
Chris Traeger," It is something that we need to figure out, and we should do that right now."
Ann Perkins, I'm so happy you said that.
Ann Perkins," Wow, that's disgusting."
Chris Traeger," Yes, it's very hard to drink."
Extra," Yeah, why should we trust this Ben Wyatt guy?"
Ben Wyatt,Because I'm trusty.
Ben Wyatt, Trust me.
Ben Wyatt, I'm trustworthy.
Ben Wyatt, And I am working very hard to make sure that this town gets back on its feet.
Leslie Knope, Here we go.
Leslie Knope," Okay, great."
Extra," Next caller? So, I looked you up on AltaVista, and I found out that the last seven towns you've gone to ended up bankrupt."
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt," First of all, why does everyone in this town use AltaVista? Is it 1997? And second, I am a budget specialist."
Ben Wyatt," I went to those towns because they were bankrupt, and now, they aren't."
Ben Wyatt," And yeah, I screwed up when I was 18, but who doesn't do dumb stuff when they're 18? Joan?"
Joan Callamezzo, I stole my gym teacher's husband.
Ben Wyatt," So, there you go."
Leslie Knope, Well.
Leslie Knope," What else you got, callers? Going once, going... Here we go."
Extra," Yeah, hi."
Extra, Can you tell me more about the corn maze at the Harvest Festival? Are dogs allowed?
April Ludgate,Hello.
Andy Dwyer, Hello.
April Ludgate, How did it go today?
Andy Dwyer,It was super fun.
April Ludgate, It was? Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, You have a list for tomorrow?
April Ludgate,You want to do this again tomorrow?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I do."
Andy Dwyer," I mean, it's the deal, right? I got to do it for a whole month, and then, you're not going to move to Indianapolis."
April Ludgate, I better be the only person you kissed today.
Andy Dwyer," Yeah, I'm positive that you are."
Ben Wyatt," If I thought you were serious, I'd be offended, Perd."
Ben Wyatt, But I know that we're buddies.
Ben Wyatt, And I know you wouldn't do that to me.
Ben Wyatt," But, no, this is a birthmark, Perd."
Ben Wyatt, Okay? This is the little scar I got when I was nine and I fell off my bike.
Ben Wyatt," So, no, I'm not perfect."
Leslie Knope, I can't look away.
Tom Haverford, It's amazing.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt," Wait, wait, wait."
Ben Wyatt," Now, here's the best part."
Perd Hapley," Okay, that's all the time we have here on Ya' Heard? I'm Perd Hapley, Channel Four."
Ben Wyatt," More like ""Turd Crapley."""
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah? Bravo! Thank you very much.

Leslie Knope,"Now, after we are given the certificate, who do you think should speak first?"
Leslie Knope,I think it should be me and then you.
Leslie Knope,"But, if you want, it could be you and then me."
Leslie Knope,"Or it could go me, you, me."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Ron Swanson,How about just you?
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Tomorrow, the Parks and Rec Department is receiving a commendation at the Indiana Statehouse for bringing the Harvest Festival back."
Leslie Knope,"And although it's purely ceremonial, it's a huge deal for me to go to the Statehouse."
Ron Swanson,I couldn't care less about the commendation.
Ron Swanson,"But Indianapolis is home to Charles Mulligan's Steakhouse, the best damn steakhouse in the damn state."
Ron Swanson,I have taken a picture of every steak I've ever eaten there.
Ron Swanson,June 2004.
Ron Swanson,"Porterhouse, medium rare, Bearnaise sauce."
Ron Swanson,January 2000.
Ron Swanson,"They call this one ""The Enforcer."""
Ron Swanson,February '96.
Ron Swanson,"The steak, rib eye."
Ron Swanson,"The whiskey, Lagavulin 16."
Ron Swanson,"The lady next to me, a bitch."
Ron Swanson,"Specifically, my ex-wife, Tammy."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, this is the first time I ever went there."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, look at me."
Ron Swanson,I'm just a kid.
Leslie Knope,"She's showing some elephant-- Ooh, la la."
Leslie Knope,Look who's fancy.
Tom Haverford,Am I wearing an ascot?
Tom Haverford,I didn't notice.
Tom Haverford,Big night at the Snakehole Lounge!
Tom Haverford,"It's a launch party for Dennis Feinstein's new fragrance, Allergic for Men."
Tom Haverford,Pawnee's own Dennis Feinstein is a real up-and-comer in the world of microbrewed perfumes and body sprays.
Tom Haverford,"His ether based perfume, Blackout, was named one of Maxim's top hundred ways to trick someone into sex."
Tom Haverford,"Club opens at 6:00, event starts at 9:00."
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, way too late."
Jerry Gergich,I will be deep into my bath by then.
Leslie Knope,Don't let us picture that.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you gonna go?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't think so.
Ben Wyatt,"Probably just gonna take it easy, but thank you."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, they always ask me to go out with them."
Ben Wyatt,They're just being polite.
Ben Wyatt,"I move around a lot, so the friends I make in these cities, they're like Facebook friends, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,"""Hey, Doug from Bloomington is thinking about buying a shirt."""
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, Doug, who cares?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, I want you to take Ben and make him go to that anti-histamine party."
Tom Haverford,"It's ""Allergic,"" and forget it."
Leslie Knope,He doesn't know anybody in town.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Tom, take him under your tiny little wing."
Tom Haverford,"He's a fully grown man, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,And tonight's just not about pleasure.
Tom Haverford,"I'm schmoozing Dennis Feinstein so I can pitch him my new cologne, Tommy Fresh."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, while you're doing that, I want you to picture Ben in his motel room, all by himself with no friends, staring at the wall."
Tom Haverford,Deal.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Andy Dwyer,So my band's working on a new album.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah?"
April Ludgate,What's it called?
Andy Dwyer,"April Ludgate is the Best Ever, Volume One."
April Ludgate,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,"So, what do you wanna do tonight?"
Andy Dwyer,We could watch TV at Burly's house or we could watch TV at your house.
Andy Dwyer,"Or, I mean, we could watch TV at Best Buy."
April Ludgate,Why don't we go to Tom's thing?
April Ludgate,That weird cologne party thing at the Snakehole?
Andy Dwyer,I kind of forgot that you need money when you have a girlfriend.
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna treat April like a queen, and queens deserve flowers and massages, chocolate, booze, diamonds, rubies, emeralds, them treasure chests full of scarves, different kinds of lubes that warm up when you rub 'em on stuff."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna give her all that stuff.
Andy Dwyer,And more.
Andy Dwyer,That sounds pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, let's do it."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Bye.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,I guess we're dating.
April Ludgate,It's new.
April Ludgate,Whatever!
April Ludgate,I don't like labels.
April Ludgate,Go away.
Leslie Knope,This?
Ann Perkins,That would be good.
Leslie Knope,"But does it say, ""Hello, general assembly, I've come to Indianapolis to accept your commendation?"""
Ann Perkins,As much as any one dress could.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I think Chris is cheating on me."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That lying bastard!
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,How do you know?
Ann Perkins,I don't have any actual proof.
Leslie Knope,Then I'm sure he's not cheating on you.
Leslie Knope,"And if he is, he's a monster."
Leslie Knope,"And if he's not, you guys are great together."
Leslie Knope,"But if he is, I will kill him."
Ann Perkins,"Well, we had a really good conversation about our relationship last week, and he was very reassuring that we're headed in a good direction."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ann Perkins,But then he got distant.
Ann Perkins,"And when I asked to come visit him in Indianapolis, he was totally weird."
Ann Perkins,He was weird.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it sounds like you're just spiraling."
Ann Perkins,But what if I'm not?
Ann Perkins,What if I'm not?
Ann Perkins,What if he has a girl up there?
Ann Perkins,I think he's cheating on me.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, luckily, I'm heading up there."
Leslie Knope,I'll invite him out to dinner and I'll poke around a little bit.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not gonna be able to keep anything from me."
Leslie Knope,"In high school, they used to call me Angela Lansbury."
Leslie Knope,But that was because of my haircut.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, champ."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, champion."
Tom Haverford,"Listen, you should come out tonight."
Tom Haverford,Club's gonna be dope.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm pretty sure you have nothing else going on."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's not totally true."
Ben Wyatt,The owner of the motel I'm staying at said she was gonna screen Hope Floats in the lobby.
Ben Wyatt,Asked me if I wanted to watch.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,You should probably get out of that.
Tom Haverford,I think she's gonna murder you.
Tom Haverford,Come on down to the Snakehole.
Tom Haverford,I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I'll stop by."
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you mind if I ask?"
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna wear tonight?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I was probably just gonna stick with this."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, seriously."
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna wear?
Ben Wyatt,Something totally different.
Ben Wyatt,Probably go home and grab something.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Leslie Knope,"If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's second largest rocking chair."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Then maybe we should take a quick two hour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.
Leslie Knope,"It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"What's wrong with you, grouchy pants?"
Ron Swanson,I've been fasting all day to save room for Mulligan's.
Leslie Knope,"Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to understand, we are heading for the most special place on earth."
Ron Swanson,"When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache, and I refuse to clean it because, every now and then, a piece of meat will fall into my mouth."
Leslie Knope,"I forgot to tell you, Chris Traeger is joining us for dinner tonight."
Ron Swanson,Please tell me he's meeting us at the restaurant.
Leslie Knope,"No, we are picking him up."
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman!"
Chris Traeger,Welcome.
Chris Traeger,I am so glad you guys called.
Chris Traeger,This is gonna be great.
Chris Traeger,"Come on in, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Ron Swanson,Or we could just--
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Look at your foyer.
Leslie Knope,It's like a spa in here.
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,The entranceway to your house sends a message to the world about who you are.
Chris Traeger,And the front door provides energy flow and opportunity.
Chris Traeger,You cannot limit that.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ron doesn't even have a front door.
Leslie Knope,He won't even tell me his address.
Leslie Knope,Ask him where he lives.
Chris Traeger,Where do you live?
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,So this is some kind of coat closet or something?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here."
Chris Traeger,I like coats.
Leslie Knope,Could I use your bathroom really quick?
Chris Traeger,It's right behind you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Toilet seat's up.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, let me get a beer and a Pawnee Sunrise."
Extra,Do you wanna pay cash or start a tab?
Andy Dwyer,I It's okay I know Tom.
Extra,Tom who?
Andy Dwyer,Tom Hammen Hammenstein.
April Ludgate,Haverford.
Andy Dwyer,Haverford.
Andy Dwyer,"He's, like, my best friend."
Extra,"Hey, Freddy, this guy says he knows Tom and wants a drink for free."
Freddy,You got money to pay for those drinks?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Freddy,"Make room for the paying customers, huh?"
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Knope!"
Leslie Knope,Just one second.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I think you might be right."
Leslie Knope,I found a woman's razor in Chris's shower and a pink swimming cap.
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Ann Perkins,What the hell?
Leslie Knope,"You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something."
Ann Perkins,I don't I'm coming up there.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"All right, okay."
Chris Traeger,"All right, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,"They just forgot to unlock the door, that's all."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, it looks like they're closed for some kind of health code violation."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, stop it!"
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Ron Swanson,They just boarded her up like she was some common warehouse.
Ron Swanson,I should have been here.
Ron Swanson,What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed?
Ron Swanson,Do you think they got eaten?
Chris Traeger,Why don't we go back to my place and I'll fire up the grill?
Leslie Knope,You sure you're not expecting company or something?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,"What do you say, Ron?"
Chris Traeger,"Go back to my place, I'll make you some grub?"
Chris Traeger,It'll be just as good as it would've been here.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Tom Haverford,That man is a legend.
Tom Haverford,Think about all the scents he's created.
Tom Haverford,"Attack, Yearning, Thickening, Itch, Coma, Sideboob."
Ben Wyatt,"Dennis Feinstein, though?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,So what's your plan?
Tom Haverford,"Wait till he's alone, then I'll walk up and spray him with Tommy Fresh, and I say, "" Uh-oh."""
Tom Haverford,"""Looks like you just inhaled your future."""
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,That might actually work.
April Ludgate,Is everything okay?
Andy Dwyer,"It kind of sucks that I'm super broke and I wanna buy you stuff and it's embarrassing that I can't, but I'm broke too, and I don't want anything."
April Ludgate,I just wanna hang out with you.
April Ludgate,"Plus, I can get free drinks any time I want."
Andy Dwyer,How?
April Ludgate,I'm a girl in a sleazy club.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Extra,Hey.
April Ludgate,I hate drinking alone.
Extra,Can I get you a drink?
April Ludgate,Sure.
April Ludgate,Triple whiskey.
Extra,What's your name?
April Ludgate,Oprah.
Extra,I'm Kevin.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,I kind of wanna drink alone.
April Ludgate,But I said I wanna drink alone.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Bye.
April Ludgate,Here.
April Ludgate,You take this one.
April Ludgate,I will get myself a martini from that idiot.
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, do you have any sisters?"
Chris Traeger,"No, I don't, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,Do you have sisters?
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,So how's your mom?
Leslie Knope,Is she visiting?
Chris Traeger,"No, she's home up in Wisconsin."
Chris Traeger,Is your mom visiting?
Leslie Knope,Any aunts?
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Chris Traeger,You have aunts?
Leslie Knope,Girl cousins?
Leslie Knope,"A youthful grandmother, perhaps?"
Chris Traeger,Nope.
Ron Swanson,Did you forget how to have a conversation?
Chris Traeger,I am so happy you guys are here.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna go fire up the grill.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna kill him, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,Chris is cheating on Ann.
Leslie Knope,There's evidence everywhere.
Leslie Knope,She's coming up here so they can have it out.
Ron Swanson,Ask her to bring some garlic salt.
Ron Swanson,I'm worried Chris doesn't have any.
April Ludgate,I got this from a waiter.
April Ludgate,I told him I had a pork deficiency.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet!
Andy Dwyer,Pigs in a blanket.
Andy Dwyer,I always wondered why they call them that.
Andy Dwyer,Look what I got.
Andy Dwyer,Look what I got from the bathroom.
Andy Dwyer,Mints.
Andy Dwyer,Six of 'em.
April Ludgate,Nice.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Okay, whoever gets the most free stuff by the end of the night wins."
Andy Dwyer,Deal.
Andy Dwyer,Go!
Chris Traeger,"Ron, would you like some salad?"
Ron Swanson,"Since I am not a rabbit, no, I do not."
Chris Traeger,Try it.
Chris Traeger,Salad's good for you.
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,Delicious.
Leslie Knope,"So, Chris, what do you do up here in your spare time?"
Chris Traeger,"Well, I exercise, and I exercise my mind."
Chris Traeger,And I try to keep up on current events.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's what you call it."
Chris Traeger,Sorry?
Leslie Knope,How are things going with Ann?
Leslie Knope,You know what's funny about Ann?
Leslie Knope,"She's my best friend, and anyone who hurt her is someone I would murder, probably."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, is that what's upsetting you?"
Chris Traeger,This is very uncomfortable for me.
Chris Traeger,I don't know what to say.
Tom Haverford,Watch the master work it.
Tom Haverford,I'm the Yoda of networking.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Yoda wouldn't actually need networking."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, his powers were more spiritual."
Tom Haverford,"Shut up, you nerd!"
Ben Wyatt,I get it.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Mr. Feinstein, Tom Haverford."
Tom Haverford,I'm the organizer of this soiree and I'm also a huge fan of yours.
Tom Haverford,I use all your colognes.
Tom Haverford,Sometimes two at once!
Dennis Feinstein,I don't recommend that.
Dennis Feinstein,Are you from the FDA?
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, legally, if you're from the FDA, you have to tell me."
Tom Haverford,I wanted to talk to you because I actually created my own scent.
Dennis Feinstein,Great.
Dennis Feinstein,"I'd love to smell it, right?"
Tom Haverford,I know you're a busy guy.
Dennis Feinstein,"Yeah, man."
Dennis Feinstein,I'm crazy busy.
Dennis Feinstein,"But all day long, people are pitching me colognes."
Dennis Feinstein,That guy just pitched me a cologne called Sluts.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna tell you what I told him.
Dennis Feinstein,Not just anybody can do this.
Dennis Feinstein,"Although it's a great name, and I'm probably gonna steal it."
Tom Haverford,"Please, it'll take two seconds."
Tom Haverford,"If you like it, maybe we go into business together, branch out in other states, move over to watches and fancy raincoats, open up stores in London and Paris."
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I haven't thought it through.
Tom Haverford,"But for now, I want to present Tommy Fresh."
Dennis Feinstein,"All right, I get it."
Dennis Feinstein,It's a gag scent.
Dennis Feinstein,Hilarious!
Tom Haverford,"As in, ""It's hilarious how awesome it is""?"
Dennis Feinstein,It smells like somebody spilled Chinese food in a bird cage.
Dennis Feinstein,Horrible!
Dennis Feinstein,It's assaultive.
Dennis Feinstein,It takes everything in my power to not retch right now.
Dennis Feinstein,"Kid, you need to find another game."
Dennis Feinstein,Leave perfumery to the real men.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ann, if you get this, I don't know if you should come up here."
Leslie Knope,"He's not worth it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Call me, let me know where you are, and if you have Ron?"
Ron Swanson,What in the devil's name is this?
Chris Traeger,Portobello mushrooms.
Ron Swanson,Where's the steak?
Chris Traeger,There's no steak.
Chris Traeger,That's a healthier option.
Chris Traeger,It's organically grown.
Ron Swanson,Lord.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay."
Leslie Knope,Could you get us a cold compress or something?
April Ludgate,"Hey, six beers for table 12."
Extra,Do you work here?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,My dad owns this place.
April Ludgate,I'm Janet.
April Ludgate,Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,This round's on the house!
April Ludgate,All right!
April Ludgate,How about some tips?
Andy Dwyer,"Gum or mint, sir?"
Extra,Gum.
Extra,"Then a mint, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,"All out, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"Don't have those either, sir."
Extra,Do you have anything?
Andy Dwyer,"Out of everything, sir."
Andy Dwyer,This is so awesome!
Andy Dwyer,We are like Robin Hood.
Andy Dwyer,We steal from the club and we give to ourselves.
Leslie Knope,"Look, we'll find a 24 hour diner."
Leslie Knope,Or we can get one of those cows that we saw on the way up here and we'll bring it back and we'll make steaks out of that.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, what are you doing here?"
Ann Perkins,Whose pink razor's in your shower?
Chris Traeger,Excuse me?
Ann Perkins,Leslie found a pink razor and a pink swimming cap in your shower.
Ann Perkins,Whose is it?
Chris Traeger,I guess you're talking about my razor.
Chris Traeger,"I shave my legs for swimming, and women's razors work better."
Chris Traeger,"For whatever reason, men's razor technology hasn't figured out how to properly contour the shinbone."
Ann Perkins,And the swimming cap?
Chris Traeger,"Indiana Breast Cancer Awareness Triathlon, 2009."
Chris Traeger,Came in fourth!
Leslie Knope,"Well, I found concealer in your medicine cabinet."
Leslie Knope,What's that about?
Chris Traeger,I'm a human being.
Chris Traeger,Sometimes I get blemishes.
Chris Traeger,I'm not perfect.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"I am so sorry, honey."
Ann Perkins,I'm so embarrassed.
Ann Perkins, I was scared that you were cheating on me.
Chris Traeger," No, I'm not cheating on you."
Chris Traeger, But I'm also not dating you.
Chris Traeger, We broke up last week.
Chris Traeger, We talked at your house.
Chris Traeger, Do you not remember this?
Ann Perkins,"Of course I remember, but we didn't break up."
Chris Traeger," I'm sorry, Ann, but I'm certain we did."
Ann Perkins," Okay, you said that you didn't wanna leave Pawnee and that I was the most amazing woman you had ever met."
Chris Traeger, Which you are.
Ann Perkins," And then I said that I would move to Indianapolis if I had to, and you said you didn't wanna make me do that, and then you said that in a different world... Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins, You broke up with me.
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, so here's what happened."
Leslie Knope," Sweet and beautiful Ann has never been dumped before, and Chris is such a positive person, when he broke up with her, she just didn't realize it."
Leslie Knope, It's kind of understandable.
Leslie Knope, Although it does kind of make you wonder how good of a nurse she is.
Ann Perkins," Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins," You left, and you said you were gonna work late, and I kissed you?"
Chris Traeger,"As enjoyable as that was, I did find it odd."
Ann Perkins, And then I wanted you to meet my parents?
Chris Traeger," I'm sure they're great people, but strange."
Ann Perkins, This is humiliating.
Ann Perkins," I'm sorry, I gotta go."
Ben Wyatt," Hey, hey, man."
Ben Wyatt, I got you another melon-tini.
Tom Haverford, Thanks.
Ben Wyatt," Listen, that guy is a jerk, and if you ask me, he smells like--"
Tom Haverford,Success! He smells like success.
Tom Haverford, You know what I smell like? A teriyaki hairpiece?
Ben Wyatt, A teriyaki hairpiece?
Tom Haverford,I smell like the guy who's always coming up short.
Tom Haverford, And you know what? I'm just sick of it.
Tom Haverford, Tommy Fresh was my dream.
Tom Haverford, Now no one's ever gonna smell it but me.
Ben Wyatt," I can smell your dreams, Tom."
Ben Wyatt, I can.
Ben Wyatt, And I can smell 'em from here.
Ben Wyatt," And honestly, they smell terrible."
Ben Wyatt, But I like Tom.
April Ludgate, I've got a jar of olives.
Andy Dwyer, Nice.
April Ludgate, A thing of toothpicks that look like swords.
April Ludgate, And a year's supply of toilet paper.
Andy Dwyer, I got Boom! 38 dollars in tips.
April Ludgate,180 dollars.
Andy Dwyer, We should give it back.
April Ludgate, We should give it back.
Andy Dwyer, Follow me.
April Ludgate, Okay.
April Ludgate," Oh, my God."
Bartender, Wow.
Bartender, Thank you.
Leslie Knope," One time, when I was in high school, a guy's mom called me and broke up with me for him."
Leslie Knope, There was another time where I was on a date and I tripped and broke my kneecap.
Leslie Knope," And then the guy said he wasn't ""feeling it,"" so he left and I waited for an ambulance."
Leslie Knope," One time I was dating this guy for a while, and then he got down on one knee and he begged me to never call him again."
Leslie Knope, One guy broke up with me while we were in the shower together.
Leslie Knope, Skywriting isn't always positive.
Leslie Knope," Another time, a guy invited me to a beautiful picnic with wine and flowers, and then, when I tried to sit down, he said, ""Don't eat anything."""
Leslie Knope,"""Rebecca's coming."""
Leslie Knope,And then he broke up with me.
Ann Perkins, Who was Rebecca?
Leslie Knope,Yeah. Exactly.
Ann Perkins, Thanks for driving me.
Ann Perkins, Wait.
Ann Perkins, You're getting your commendation tomorrow at the Statehouse.
Leslie Knope," Oh, please."
Leslie Knope, It's just a goofy ceremony.
Leslie Knope, I don't even care about it.
Ann Perkins, Leslie.
Leslie Knope," Besides, Ron is staying behind."
Leslie Knope, He'll go.
Ann Perkins, Is Ron gonna be okay? 
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know.
Ron Swanson, This isn't a steak.
Ron Swanson, Why would you call it that on your menu?
Extra," I don't know what to tell you, man."
Ron Swanson, Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have.
Ron Swanson," Wait, wait."
Ron Swanson," I worry what you just heard was, ""Give me a lot of bacon and eggs."""
Ron Swanson,"What I said was, ""Give me all the bacon and eggs you have."""
Ron Swanson,Do you understand?
Tom Haverford, It's called a Tommytini.
Tom Haverford, It's just vodka and a bunch of cinnamon.
Ben Wyatt, That sounds gross.
Donna Meagle,Ben.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, Miller Lite."
Ben Wyatt, How'd you know?
Tom Haverford,Everybody knows.
Tom Haverford, That's your drink.
Donna Meagle, Tommy.
Tom Haverford, Let's do this.
Leslie Knope, Mmm.
Ben Wyatt, How's it going? 
Leslie Knope,"Hey, look who's socializing!"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, and I'm having a good time."
Leslie Knope, Sit with us.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Ann's in kind of a crappy mood because Chris dumped her.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, like a week ago, right?"
Ann Perkins," Yeah, but I only knew about it an hour ago."
Ben Wyatt, So that's why you tried to kiss him.
Ben Wyatt, We were all seriously confused about that.
Ann Perkins," Who's ""we""? What are you-- Oh, God."
April Ludgate, Did you keep the toilet paper?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer," I feel bad, but I need it."
Ben Wyatt," Hey, hey, that's gotta be Feinstein's car."
Tom Haverford, Why? 
Ben Wyatt,Give me Tommy Fresh.
Ben Wyatt, He's gonna smell your dreams now.
Leslie Knope, Are you okay? Is it that bad?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, it's unbelievable."

Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,And I am so proud of all of you.
Leslie Knope,You've worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have a surprise."
Leslie Knope,"And it is possibly the best thing to potentially ever happen to anyone, anywhere, in the history of the universe."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the world famous Little Sebastian."
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Tom Haverford,No way!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I never thought I'd get to meet him.
Tom Haverford,It's really him.
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Well done!
Leslie Knope,"Little Sebastian made his debut at the last Harvest Festival in 1987, and he was an instant phenomenon."
Leslie Knope,That week he was the eighth most photographed object in America.
Leslie Knope,"So suck it, the Alamo."
Ben Wyatt,"So, what am I missing?"
Ben Wyatt,What's the deal with this pony?
Tom Haverford,"He's not a pony, Ben."
Tom Haverford,He's a mini-horse.
Tom Haverford,There's a big difference.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, why is he so famous?"
Ben Wyatt,Does he do something?
Ben Wyatt,What does he do?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he does being a mini-horse, and he does it better than anyone."
Ron Swanson,"Son, this horse has an honorary degree from Notre Dame."
Leslie Knope,We all need to be very careful.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Remember.
Leslie Knope,This little guy is 25 now.
Leslie Knope,And he has cataracts in both eyes.
Leslie Knope,He has severe arthritis.
Leslie Knope,Jerry's going to look after him.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, I am."
Jerry Gergich,We are both on the same diabetes medication.
Jerry Gergich,Are you my Glucotrol buddy?
Jerry Gergich,Are you?
Leslie Knope,Isn't it amazing?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I've just got to be honest.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know what the big deal is.
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Tanya,"Okay, couldn't you put Sue's Salads here?"
Leslie Knope,On Deep Fried Boulevard?
Tanya,It's just-- There's so many junk food places and only one salad stand.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we want to make money, not make people hate themselves."
Tanya,Salad's are my life.
Leslie Knope,"Of course, I'm sorry, you know what we'll do, we'll make Sue's Salads the official healthy choice of the festival."
Tanya,"Well that's great, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Of course, nobody's going to come to your stupid booth anyway."
Leslie Knope,The Harvest Festival is the biggest thing I've ever done in my career.
Leslie Knope,"And if it fails, the Parks Department will be eliminated."
Leslie Knope,That's why we're going big.
Leslie Knope,"Seven days, over 30 different locations, 50,000 plus visitors and four hospitality kiosks."
Leslie Knope,"God, I've got to stop ending on that boring thing."
Leslie Knope,Clowns.
Leslie Knope,"No you cannot sell home-brewed water, and no I would not like to taste it."
Leslie Knope,"April, who's next?"
Ben Wyatt,"Man, you are just knocking these off."
Ben Wyatt,You're like a ninja crossed with a Jedi or something.
Tom Haverford,You're like a nerd mixed with a dork or something.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, Star Wars is not that nerdy."
Leslie Knope,"No, Star Wars is not that nerdy."
Ben Wyatt,It's not.
Ben Wyatt,Everyone has seen it.
Leslie Knope,Everyone has seen it.
Ben Wyatt,Everyone.
April Ludgate,This guy's here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ken."
Ken Hotate,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,This is Ben and Tom.
Tom Haverford,That's a dope bolo.
Leslie Knope,This is Ken Hotate.
Leslie Knope,He is the tribal leader of the Wamapoke.
Leslie Knope,"I just said, hello honored guest. Although literally translated it means may you be blessed with a million possums."
Leslie Knope,The Wamapoke used to use possums as currency.
Leslie Knope,Have a seat.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I know why you're here."
Leslie Knope,And just let me say that we really tried.
Ken Hotate,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but this is a big one."
Ken Hotate,I'm under a lot of pressure.
Ken Hotate,I'm going to need to formally ask you to move the carnival.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"The carnival is on the site of the Battle of Indian Hill, which was an epic seven day battle that the Wamapoke lost due to the fact that they didn't have any weapons."
Ken Hotate,"During the battle, 93 year old chief was shot one hundred and two times by the cavalry."
Tom Haverford,Did he die?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ken Hotate,And this moment will be commemorated for the next seven days with shooting galleries and fried dough stands.
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I understand, but this is the only place in town that's big enough to house the carnival rides."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you know with Pawnee's history, it's very difficult to not be offensive."
Leslie Knope,This is a map of all the atrocities the Pawnee settlers inflicted upon the Wamapoke Indians.
Leslie Knope,The atrocities are in blue.
Leslie Knope,"We put up a memorial plaque, and we have a Wamapoke exhibit in the history tent."
Ken Hotate,"I completely understand you, but this is sacred burial ground."
Ken Hotate,And I just hope that the souls of my ancestors don't put a curse on this festival.
Ken Hotate,There are two things I know about white people.
Ken Hotate,"They love Rachael Ray, and they are terrified of curses."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"So, somebody, I don't want to say who, it was totally me, got Sweetums to donate another fifteen cotton candy machines."
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse."
Leslie Knope,"Ow, ow, ow!"
Ben Wyatt,Right in the chest.
Ben Wyatt,Bazooka.
Ben Wyatt,That's funny.
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, get a room."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so guys, focus up."
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo is coming by with a camera crew for an exclusive, last minute walkthrough of the Harvest Festival before we open tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,"So, everything needs to be perfect."
Leslie Knope,Joan is always looking for a scandal.
Leslie Knope,She's like an eagleeyed tiger.
Andy Dwyer,Eagle Eyed Tiger.
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Leslie Knope,"So, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,Let's grab hands.
Ron Swanson,I don't hold hands.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You're all amazing, wonderful people."
Leslie Knope,"And I really want you to have fun today and not focus on the fact that if one thing goes wrong, we're all going to lose our jobs."
Ben Wyatt,That's not inspiring.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go get them, everybody."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Any concerns, address them to Ron."
Ron Swanson,"The advantages to being Leslie's boss is that she does everything herself, and there are never any problems."
Ron Swanson,"Which means for the next week, I can sit in this lawn chair, and read this book about old boats. Excuse me, I have to get back to work."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, whatever happened to you and the Bionic Man?"
Ann Perkins,Chris?
Ann Perkins,"He broke up with me, but he did it so nicely that I didn't even realize he did it."
Donna Meagle,I've done that to multiple men.
Donna Meagle,How are you doing?
Donna Meagle,Are you doing okay?
Ann Perkins,Thank you so much for asking.
Ann Perkins,It's been tough.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Two days ago, I was sobbing at a pizza buffet, and they asked me to leave."
Ann Perkins,I've been looking at some dog adoption websites.
Ann Perkins,Bought 700 dollars worth of candles from Anthropologie.
Ann Perkins,I did this to my hair.
Ann Perkins,"You know, your basic bottoming out kind of stuff."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,"Normally, people tell you to talk about your problems."
Donna Meagle,I'm going to recommend you bottle that noise up.
Ann Perkins,That's what my mailman said.
Joan Callamezzo,Murder.
Joan Callamezzo,Murder the most melons.
Joan Callamezzo,Shaquille showered.
Joan Callamezzo,Shame on Shakira's sheets.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Joan."
Joan Callamezzo,"Hello, Leslie."
Joan Callamezzo,Looks like a very impressive festival.
Joan Callamezzo,But we'll see.
Joan Callamezzo,We'll see.
Leslie Knope,You remember Ben.
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.
Joan Callamezzo,It's nice to see you again.
Leslie Knope,Let's get started.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the festival is spread throughout the town, but the centerpiece is the carnival."
Leslie Knope,And over here is Indiana's largest corn maze.
Joan Callamezzo,Wow.
Joan Callamezzo,Is that Pawnee corn or Eagleton corn?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee corn.
Leslie Knope,And it's organic.
Leslie Knope,"Over here, we have our beautiful Ferris wheel."
Joan Callamezzo,"Beautiful, but deadly."
Joan Callamezzo,When was the last time this giant wheel of death was inspected?
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, twice in the last week, and everything is 100% up to code."
Joan Callamezzo,How many of these carnies are illegals?
Leslie Knope,None.
Leslie Knope,They're all U.S citizens.
Leslie Knope,"Over in this booth, Indiana basketball legend Larry Bird's Aunt Tilda will be signing autographs for two hours on Thursday."
Joan Callamezzo,You got Tilda?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We got Tilda.
Leslie Knope,But the real coup is over there.
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Joan Callamezzo,Are you [bleep] kidding me?
Joan Callamezzo,You got Little Sebastian?
Leslie Knope,See for yourself.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,He is so adorable.
Tom Haverford,"Thank you, Joan."
Tom Haverford,"And Little Sebastian isn't bad, either!"
Joan Callamezzo,Tom!
Tom Haverford,How are you?
Joan Callamezzo,Good.
Tom Haverford,Good to see you.
Tom Haverford,Hold on a second.
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Tom Haverford,Did you get your breasts done?
Tom Haverford,You look amazing.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, thanks for noticing."
Tom Haverford,"Joan, listen to me."
Tom Haverford,"This Harvest Festival, it's going to knock your socks off."
Tom Haverford,"And when it does, I'm going to be there to give you a foot massage."
Tom Haverford,To completion.
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Andy Dwyer,I swear.
Andy Dwyer,It's almost like they don't want you to win.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you better practice."
April Ludgate,You've got to win me a teddy bear.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to win you a million teddy bears.
April Ludgate,"Well, I want a billion teddy bears."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's a little unrealistic."
Andy Dwyer,This is a hard game.
Andy Dwyer,Two million.
April Ludgate,Deal.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
April Ludgate,"Hey, I love you."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, shut up!"
Andy Dwyer,That is awesome sauce.
Jerry Gergich,You're such a good boy.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, stop bothering Little Sebastian."
Tom Haverford,Leslie said I should watch him for a little bit.
Jerry Gergich,Perfect.
Jerry Gergich,I've got to go get him a tail scrunchie.
Tom Haverford,"Hi Little Sebastian, how's it going?"
Tom Haverford,"Pretty good, just eating some hay, hanging out. What's your name?"
Tom Haverford,My name's Tom. Oh you're really well-dressed.
Tom Haverford,"I like how you have your t-shirt over your dress shirt, you look way cooler than everybody else here."
Tom Haverford,"Little Sebastian come on, you're making me blush."
Tom Haverford,Most people look at Little Sebastian and they see a famous minihorse.
Tom Haverford,"I see an advertising opportunity for my club, the Snakehole Lounge."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Tom Haverford,That is a shockingly huge minihorse erection.
Joan Callamezzo,"I don't think I'm being unprofessional, I was really hoping for more tawdry scandals."
Joan Callamezzo,"What about your friend Ben, here?"
Joan Callamezzo,We all know his story.
Joan Callamezzo,"One of failure, remind us of that failure."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you know, when I was an 18 year old mayor, I tried to build a winter sports complex called Ice Town, and it bankrupted the city."
Joan Callamezzo,Yikes.
Ben Wyatt,I was also shortstop of my J.V baseball team.
Ben Wyatt,No one ever brings that up.
Joan Callamezzo,"And now, you're involved with this."
Joan Callamezzo,"Do I smell another disaster, hopefully?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, Joan, this festival, thanks to the tireless efforts of Leslie Knope, is going to bring people nothing but happiness."
Leslie Knope,Not even I could screw that up.
Joan Callamezzo,"I'm a reporter, not your therapist."
Tom Haverford,"So, anytime someone takes a picture of him, the Snakehole's logo is in it."
Tom Haverford,Am I a genius or what?
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,Where's Little Sebastian?
Tom Haverford,"Somebody left the gate open and he got out, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,What are you talking about?
Tom Haverford,Unbelievable.
Tom Haverford,Another in a long string of miserable failures.
Tom Haverford,You lost Little Sebastian!
Jerry Gergich,I wasn't even here!
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,"Hopefully I can get you out this mess, that you and no one else caused."
Jerry Gergich,You were the one watching him.
Tom Haverford,It's a poor workman that blames his tools.
Tom Haverford,You look for him.
Tom Haverford,I'm going to go tell everyone what you did.
Joan Callamezzo,The Harvest Festival starts at 9:00 a.m tomorrow morning.
Joan Callamezzo,"And as far as this reporter is concerned, it's well worth your time."
Leslie Knope,"Come on down, everyone."
Leslie Knope,It's going to be sweet.
Joan Callamezzo,"It pains me to say this, but great job here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That went well.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It did.
Leslie Knope,"Take that, curse."
Ben Wyatt,"Take that, curse."
Joan Callamezzo,Sorry?
Joan Callamezzo,What is this about a curse?
Joan Callamezzo,Curse?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,Did you Leslie!
Tom Haverford,Leslie!
Tom Haverford,It's Little Sebastian.
Tom Haverford,He's gone.
Tom Haverford,"Jerry let him escape, and we don't know where he is."
Joan Callamezzo,Keep those cameras up.
Joan Callamezzo,We've got a new intro to do.
Joan Callamezzo,Gotcha.
Joan Callamezzo,Let's go ahead.
Joan Callamezzo,Let's get some shots of chipped paint and crying babies.
Joan Callamezzo,How about some of those spooky traffic lights?
Joan Callamezzo,"Okay, you know the drill."
Joan Callamezzo,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,Is it revenge of the Wamapoke?
Joan Callamezzo,An incompetent government run amok?
Joan Callamezzo,Or probably something even worse than any of those things?
Joan Callamezzo,"While it seemed everything was ready for tomorrow, things aren't always exactly as they may seem."
Ben Wyatt,"This is bad, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes this is bad.
Leslie Knope,This is like a poop tornado. This is like a poop-nado.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, gross, but we can handle a little bad publicity."
Leslie Knope,This is way worse than that.
Leslie Knope,"This is a huge government project, and it's already a lightning rod."
Leslie Knope,"And then, you add the Wamapoke controversy."
Leslie Knope,Double lightning rod.
Ben Wyatt,"Plus, we lost that little pony."
Leslie Knope,It's a mini-horse.
Leslie Knope,And that's the third lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,Triple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,"And then, you have the curse."
Leslie Knope,Quadruple lightning rod.
Leslie Knope,It's a classic four-rod distaster.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh right, one of those."
Leslie Knope,"God, now all the vendors are going to bail, and the ticket sales will go down."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, but do people in this town really believe in curses?"
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is an incredibly superstitious town. A travelling magician came through one time and he pulled a rabbit out of a hat, and the mob burned him at the stake for being a witch."
Leslie Knope,The year was 1973.
Jerry Gergich,We are really up a creek here.
Jerry Gergich,What the heck are we going to do?
Tom Haverford,You mean what are you gonna do?
Jerry Gergich,"No, what are do gonna you?"
Tom Haverford,What am do gonna I? That's a great question Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Can you believe we left Little Sebastian with the gentleman?
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you were the one watching him."
Ron Swanson,"Okay apparently I'm gonna get any work done, how did this happen?"
April Ludgate,Maybe Little Sebastian got upset because he tried to share his true feelings with someone and they didn't reciprocate.
Andy Dwyer,That's not bad.
Andy Dwyer,"Or maybe a balloon popped somewhere and it scared him, sent him running off."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, check the field behind the parking lot."
Tom Haverford,I don't want to go with Jerry.
Tom Haverford,He's the one who deliberated caused me to accidentally let the horse out.
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Jerry Gergich,Stop it.
Ron Swanson,Hang on. All of you listen to me.
Ron Swanson,That magnificent little horse is lost and he's probably scared and it's our fault.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Jerry, you get along."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, April, check the corn maze."
Andy Dwyer,Good idea.
Andy Dwyer,Horses love mazes.
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie?"
Ann Perkins,"This big, beefy dude just came into the first aid tent because he was dehydrated, and then, a reporter came in and asked if it was because of the curse."
Leslie Knope,No comment.
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""No comment""?"
Leslie Knope,"You've got to say ""No comment."""
Ann Perkins,I did.
Leslie Knope,"Good, Ann."
Leslie Knope,You're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, just treat him and release him, and then, don't say anything to anyone about anything for the rest of the month."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Run, Ann, run!"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,You've got to see this.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ken Hotate,Thank you for having me.
Ken Hotate,"The fact is, this carnival is being held on top of an ancient Wamapoke burial site."
Perd Hapley,Much like the house in the movie Poltergeist?
Ken Hotate,Exactly.
Ken Hotate,I spoke to Leslie Knope of the Parks Department about moving the carnival and she refused.
Perd Hapley,We do have exclusive animation of that event.
Perd Hapley,Let's take a look.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I love these things."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Perd Hapley,Is that what happened?
Leslie Knope,None of that happened.
Ken Hotate,That is exactly what happened.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,What we do is we move the shooting gallery.
Leslie Knope,That seems to be their biggest problem.
Leslie Knope,Maybe that will make them happy.
Perd Hapley,"Check back in with News Channel 4, number one in curse coverage."
Andy Dwyer,You know where I would hide if I was horse. The merry-go-round. Think about it.
Andy Dwyer,You just stand still next to the other horses and no one would ever know.
Andy Dwyer,It's the perfect crime.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I'm going to go look by myself.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, are you alright?"
Andy Dwyer,You seem super not happy.
April Ludgate,I'm fine.
April Ludgate,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I might be going to Venezuela tomorrow."
April Ludgate,Forever.
Andy Dwyer,You're not fine.
Andy Dwyer,"Ludgate, I can read you like the back of a book. something is upsetting you."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you just go ahead and tell me what it is?
April Ludgate,I'm not upset.
April Ludgate,"I'm great, see."
April Ludgate,I'm not mad at Andy.
April Ludgate,Andy's great.
April Ludgate,I awesome sauce Andy.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,This maze is like a maze.
Ann Perkins,Left.
Ann Perkins,Look right.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, okay."
Extra,"I don't know what's sicker, me or your body."
Ann Perkins,You aren't sick.
Extra,Maybe you should check out my abs.
Ann Perkins,Are you experiencing abdominal pain?
Extra,Every day at the gym.
Ann Perkins,Eww.
Extra,Feel.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Extra,What are you doing tonight?
Ann Perkins,I'm prepping the medical tent.
Ann Perkins,I think I'm going to have to pass.
Extra,Your loss.
Donna Meagle,Are you going to hit that?
Ann Perkins,Him?
Ann Perkins,He isn't exactly boyfriend material.
Donna Meagle,Who said anything about a boyfriend?
Donna Meagle,Use him.
Donna Meagle,Abuse him.
Donna Meagle,Lose him.
Donna Meagle,That's the Meagle motto.
Donna Meagle,Grammy Meagle taught me that. 
Donna Meagle,"She died at the age of 84, sandwiched between two 30 year olds."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, hey, hey."
Jerry Gergich,Did you find him?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry."
April Ludgate,He's right here in my pocket.
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, he can't have gone that far. He's got the legs of Tom, the endurance of Jerry, and the diseases of Jerry."
Ron Swanson,Ground mission failed.
Ron Swanson,We need a bird's eye view.
Andy Dwyer,You want me to climb on top of the Ferris wheel?
Ben Wyatt,"We're extremely confident that there is no curse, and everyone is going to have a great time tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Extra,Wow.
Extra,"First, Ice Town."
Extra,"Now, this."
Extra,"Bad luck really follows you around, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'd like to start by addressing some of the false rumors about the festival.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, we have plenty of food."
Leslie Knope,There is no food shortage.
Leslie Knope,"There are not, as one reporter suggested, dozens of escaped convicts meandering around the carnival."
Leslie Knope,"And at no time was any Parks Department worker, quote, ""feasting on petting zoo animals."""
Tom Haverford,"You were in charge of watching a tiny horse, and you failed."
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I'm only going to say this once."
Andy Dwyer,What if Little Sebastian is on this Ferris wheel?
April Ludgate,How about you only say that never?
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, how big of a disaster will this be on a scale of nine to ten?"
Leslie Knope,It will not be a disaster.
Leslie Knope,It will be a success.
Leslie Knope,"And I want to let everyone know that, in an attempt to be sensitive to our Wamapoke friends, we have moved the shooting gallery, per their request."
Leslie Knope,"So, yes, Perd."
Perd Hapley,"Yeah, the statement that this reporter has is a question."
Perd Hapley,Will that be enough to lift the curse?
Leslie Knope,"Perd, you know as well as I do that there's no such God."
Leslie Knope,Crap on a spatula.
Joan Callamezzo,It's the curse.
Joan Callamezzo,That's exactly what it is.
Joan Callamezzo,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"Everyone, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Please, we'll get this up and running in no time."
Tom Haverford,"Well Jerry, what the hell?"
Jerry Gergich,I didn't do this.
Tom Haverford,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
April Ludgate,Jerry's fault.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry's fault.
Leslie Knope,We cannot catch a break.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, well, I'll help you out."
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I'm jinxed or something.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you were totally fine until I got involved."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I feel like I should probably just go."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,I'm really sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm the curse, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm going to get out of here."
Ben Wyatt,All right?
Jerry Gergich,"When they're missing this long, they're usually dead."
Tom Haverford,"Well, if that's true, then you're going to have to answer to the whole town."
Tom Haverford,And God.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"You were the one who let him out, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, now, stop trying to blame me."
April Ludgate,"Jerry, can you please be quiet?"
April Ludgate,I can't hear myself not talking to Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, will you please tell me why April is mad at me?"
April Ludgate,"Ron, can you please tell Andy"
Ron Swanson,"All of you, be quiet."
Ron Swanson,"Andy, she's mad because you said ""awesome sauce"" instead of ""I love you, too."""
Ron Swanson,"April, he loves you."
Ron Swanson,Stop being a child.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, you're clearly at fault here."
Ron Swanson,Blaming Jerry won't save you.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, we both know you were shotgunning funnel cakes instead of watching Little Sebastian."
Ron Swanson,"So, everyone apologize to everyone else."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Tom."
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,I do love you.
April Ludgate,You do?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"That's what, you know, makes the sauce so awesome."
Tom Haverford,Jerry just farted.
Jerry Gergich,I'm very upset.
Jerry Gergich,I get nervous.
Ed,"Hey, Leslie?"
Ed,Generator's shot.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I got the T.M.K. 2500 specifically for the extra capacity.
Ed,Wow.
Ed,You know your stuff.
Ed, You single?
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ed."
Leslie Knope, How could that happen?
Extra,All those TV crews plugged in and overloaded it.
Leslie Knope,I knew it. Stupid media.
Leslie Knope,"Let me tell you something, freedom of press is for the birds."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," How and where can I get a new one in, like, I don't know, now?"
Extra,There's only one place in town that has a generator that size.
Leslie Knope, You've got to be kidding me.
Leslie Knope,This festival was supposed to be my love letter to Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Now it's just turned into a note that say I want to see other people.
Ken Hotate," So, you need to borrow our generator? "
Leslie Knope,"Ken, I am coming to you on my knees, begging for help, much like the early settlers of Pawnee begged the Wamapoke--"
Leslie Knope,"A trick, and over 50 Wamapoke were slaughtered."
Leslie Knope," I know, but this is not a trick."
Leslie Knope," I am prepared to put the Wamapoke history exhibit inside the carnival grounds, right past the entrance turnstile, so that you have to look at it before you start having fun."
Ken Hotate," Now, that's interesting."
Extra, It's been really awesome looking at you.
Extra, Most carnival nurses are total grenades.
Ann Perkins," Okay, you're all set."
Ann Perkins, You are free to go.
Ann Perkins, Or you could stay here and make out with me until the lights come back on.
Extra," Hell, yeah."
Ann Perkins," Beat it, Donna."
Donna Meagle," Aye-aye, Captain."
Leslie Knope," I'm just trying to do something good for this town, and I'm trying to save my friends' jobs."
Leslie Knope, Can you help me out here?
Ken Hotate, A Native American tribe making a deal with the government. What could go wrong?
Ken Hotate,"You can have the generator, Leslie."
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Ken."
Ken Hotate, And I will issue a statement saying that the curse has been lifted.
Leslie Knope," Well, actually, I have another idea."
Ken Hotate," With that sacred ceremony, the Wamapoke curse has been lifted."
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, Intense stuff from Ken Hotate.
Leslie Knope," And in other good news, he gave us a scare, but he's back now."
Leslie Knope," The one, the only, Little Sebastian."
Ron Swanson," We spotted him from the top of the Ferris wheel, at the center of the corn maze."
Ron Swanson," After the power came back on, we went and got him."
Ron Swanson, It took us four hours to solve that maze.
Ron Swanson, It took the horse 15 minutes.
Ron Swanson, Jerry's still out there.
Ron Swanson, I suppose I ought to go look for him.
Ron Swanson, Right after I get a bratwurst.
Extra,Knock knock. Hey hot lips. I got out of here so fast last night I wasn't able to scoop them digits off of you.
Ann Perkins,"Oh um, that's because I didn't give them to you."
Extra,"I don't mean to brag, but I'm in the emergency room like all the time."
Ann Perkins,He was really sweet though. I'm just gonna see if maybe he wants to grab some
Donna Meagle,Park it.
Ann Perkins,Fine.
Leslie Knope, Welcome.
Leslie Knope, Come on in.
Leslie Knope, Have fun.
Extra, Thanks.
Leslie Knope," Enjoy yourself, ladies."
Ben Wyatt, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Look who's back.
Ben Wyatt, I'm sorry I left.
Ben Wyatt, I honestly felt like I was cursed or something.
Ben Wyatt," Ice Town, and now, this."
Leslie Knope," Ice Town was a disaster, and it seems like it was probably your fault."
Leslie Knope," From what I can tell, you mismanaged the hell out of it."
Ben Wyatt, Wow. Why even say that already?
Leslie Knope," But the point is, this project, this is as much yours as it is mine."
Leslie Knope," It's ours, and it's going to be really great."
Leslie Knope, And I'm glad you're here.
Ben Wyatt, Wow.
Ben Wyatt, Thank you.
Ken Hotate, Is this the guy?
Leslie Knope,Yes. This is him.
Ben Wyatt," Ah, yes."
Leslie Knope, Special Wamapoke ceremony.
Leslie Knope, The curse has been lifted.
Ben Wyatt, Wow.
Ben Wyatt, Thanks.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Gosh, you're filthy."
Leslie Knope, Go clean yourself up.
Leslie Knope, Try to look professional.
Leslie Knope, Hello.
Leslie Knope, Enjoy yourselves.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, I like your necklace.
April Ludgate, My God.
April Ludgate, He is just the best ever.
Andy Dwyer, You're the best ever.
Andy Dwyer, But he's a close second.
Andy Dwyer," Aren't you, Little Sebastian? "
Ben Wyatt,He really is amazing.
Leslie Knope," You finally get it now, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Hello? He's fantastic.
Ben Wyatt, I totally get it now.
Ben Wyatt, I don't get it.
Ben Wyatt, At all.
Ben Wyatt, It's kind of a small horse.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, what am I missing? Am I crazy?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ben, you just missed it! He whinnied!"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah. No, I totally heard that."
Ben Wyatt, It was great.

Paul,Gee whiz.
Paul,The Harvest Festival was a real triumph.
Paul,"We had over eighty thousand people in attendance, which surpassed our wildest expectations."
Paul,I would like to specifically single out Leslie Knope.
Paul,"I speak for the mayor, city council, and all of Pawnee when I say we can't wait to see what the heck you're going to do next."
Paul,"Step on up here, Les."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Paul, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Uh... Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,Holy!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Call 911!
Leslie Knope,That was the second most awkward way a man has ever grabbed my breast.
Leslie Knope,"All right, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,Just a few notes about our camping retreat tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,We're all gonna meet here and leave as a group at 6:45 a.m. promptly.
Donna Meagle,Why are we doing this?
Leslie Knope,Harvest Fest is over.
Leslie Knope,We do not wanna have a sophomore slump.
Leslie Knope,This camping trip is our chance to think of some really big ideas.
Ron Swanson,"Why don't you just tell us what our next project is, and I'll go camping by myself."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I have ideas, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 100 new ideas."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, the pressure is on."
Leslie Knope,We only have one chance to make a second impression.
April Ludgate,What portion of this camping trip will take place outside?
Leslie Knope,All of it.
April Ludgate,Pass.
Leslie Knope,Can't pass.
Leslie Knope,It's a mandatory work retreat.
Tom Haverford,I have a question.
Tom Haverford,What if we're scaling a cliff and I start to fall?
Tom Haverford,Can I grab onto your boob for support?
April Ludgate,"No, Tom, don't."
April Ludgate,Her boob kills.
Leslie Knope,My boob does not kill.
Leslie Knope,Paul did not die.
Leslie Knope,"He had a heart attack, which required an octuple bypass."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, the Pawnee Sun said that my chest saved his life."
Chris Traeger,How's the best municipal department in Pawnee?
Chris Traeger,That's you guys.
Chris Traeger,Paul is going to be recuperating for a while.
Chris Traeger,"So, the mayor asked me to step in as City Manager."
Chris Traeger,And I of course accepted immediately because Pawnee is literally the greatest town in the country.
Chris Traeger,"Of course, I am gonna miss Indianapolis, which is the most wonderful city in America."
Chris Traeger,I'm so excited to be working with you all again.
Chris Traeger,"And Leslie, I cannot wait to hear your new big idea."
Chris Traeger,"I wanna hit the ground running, and your new mystery project is going to be the hydration pack that gets me to the finish line."
Chris Traeger,You're all my little hydration packs.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure I am not.
Chris Traeger,Ron.
Chris Traeger,"Are, too."
Chris Traeger,Hydration pack!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you gotta hear this hilarious story that he's telling me."
Andy Dwyer,Tell her what happened.
Kyle,My identity was stolen.
Andy Dwyer,His identity was stolen.
Andy Dwyer,Tell her about the accounts.
Kyle,They were frozen.
Andy Dwyer,Frozen.
April Ludgate,"Bye, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,Where are you going?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,How's the coolest chick ever?
April Ludgate,Not good.
Andy Dwyer,What do you mean?
April Ludgate,Leslie's making us go on a camping retreat.
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Camping's the best.
April Ludgate,Camping sucks.
April Ludgate,It's super boring.
April Ludgate,"And you can see the stars, which I hate."
April Ludgate,They're creepy.
Andy Dwyer,I love camping.
Andy Dwyer,"I bet you I can get you to love it, too."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't I meet you out there?
Andy Dwyer,"If you hate it, we'll leave and go make out."
Andy Dwyer,"But if you love it, we'll stay and make out."
Andy Dwyer,"Either way, a ton of making out."
Andy Dwyer,You in?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Chris.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I heard you were back.
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I didn't do this because of you.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it looks great."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, you look great."
Ann Perkins,Am I right?
Chris Traeger,It's So good running into you.
Chris Traeger,"You know, we should get together soon."
Chris Traeger,I'd love to catch up.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Ann Perkins,Catch up and mustard.
Ann Perkins,Ketchup and mustard.
Chris Traeger,I just was-- Oh!
Chris Traeger,So delightful.
Chris Traeger,I relish your wit.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I salsa your face."
Ann Perkins,I should hate him.
Ann Perkins,He broke up with me.
Leslie Knope,"Well, there was an ex that I still liked after he broke up with me."
Leslie Knope,But it was really hard to stay mad at him.
Leslie Knope,He was an amazing dentist.
Ann Perkins,"You know, when he saw me, I swear his face lit up."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Ann Perkins,"What do you think ""We should get together soon"" means?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Do not read into this.
Leslie Knope,"Remember, this is the guy that was so upbeat and positive, when he broke up with you, you didn't even know it happened."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Come camping with us.
Leslie Knope,It'll be really fun.
Leslie Knope,You'll be away from Chris.
Leslie Knope,You can brainstorm.
Leslie Knope,I'll give you first dibs on s'mores.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,That sounds fun.
Leslie Knope,Here is our official retreat schedule.
Leslie Knope,It divides our time evenly between work and play.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, everybody."
Ron Swanson,Let's hustle.
Ron Swanson,Let's get to the brainstorming!
Leslie Knope,"Great attitude, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I just wanna get the work over as soon as possible so I can do some fishing.
Ron Swanson,Fishing relaxes me.
Ron Swanson,"It's like yoga, except I still get to kill something."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,I call this wonderful spot.
Jerry Gergich,You didn't bring a tent?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't really go camping ever, Jerry."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I'm not going to spend 150 dollars on a tent."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just gonna sleep on the floor.
Ron Swanson,It's called the ground when it's outside.
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Do you guys do this a lot?
Ben Wyatt,Camping?
Tom Haverford,"I've never been before, but I think I'm gonna love it."
Tom Haverford,Why am I gonna love it?
Tom Haverford,SkyMall.
Tom Haverford,Come check out my tent.
Tom Haverford,I ordered a bunch of crap off SkyMall.
Tom Haverford,"I got my TV, my Xbox, DVD."
Tom Haverford,Awesome bed right there.
Tom Haverford,DJ Roomba's in the mix.
Tom Haverford,It's like I'm not even camping.
Tom Haverford,"This is actually a dog couch, but it's super comfortable."
Andy Dwyer,It's really important to me that April loves camping.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I went ahead and set up the ultimate campsite love nest."
Andy Dwyer,Complete with beautiful starlight.
Andy Dwyer,We got champagne.
Andy Dwyer,"Also, rose petals."
Andy Dwyer,"As you can see, they smell terrific."
Leslie Knope,"We need big ideas, and we need 'em now."
Leslie Knope,Who wants to go first?
Ron Swanson,I propose that we take all the money we made from the Harvest Festival and return it to the citizens.
Leslie Knope,"So, how much would that be per person?"
Ron Swanson,About 83 cents.
Ron Swanson,Per household.
Ron Swanson,Before postage.
Ron Swanson,Are we done?
Tom Haverford,"What do Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, and Drake all have in common?"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I know this one."
Jerry Gergich,They are all rappists.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,"They're rappers, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,And what they have in common is none of them have ever performed in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,Because we don't have an adequate concert venue.
Tom Haverford,Until now.
Tom Haverford,The Pawnee Amphitheater.
Ann Perkins,How much would that cost?
Tom Haverford,Not that much.
Tom Haverford,"200, 300 million."
Ann Perkins,Right.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Donna Meagle,Luxury dog park.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to tell us any more?
Donna Meagle,Poodles only.
Donna Meagle,No pooping.
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Where are you?
Andy Dwyer,I'm here.
Andy Dwyer,Where are you?
April Ludgate,"We're inside the main entrance, near the sign that says ""Pawnee Campground."""
Andy Dwyer,I'm in a totally different place.
Andy Dwyer,That's why we can't see each other.
April Ludgate,"My God, Andy, I don't even wanna be here."
April Ludgate,The air is too fresh.
April Ludgate,It's disgusting.
April Ludgate,I can't breathe.
April Ludgate,There's a brook somewhere that won't stop babbling.
April Ludgate,Shut up!
Andy Dwyer,Sweetheart.
Andy Dwyer,Just hold tight and I'll be there.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, April is right here."
Andy Dwyer,And I am down here somewhere.
Ben Wyatt,How about we just invest the money?
Ben Wyatt,Make 4% a year.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, set up a nice little nest egg for the city."
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Tom Haverford,Great idea.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, white Urkel."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Maybe it's not the sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart."
Tom Haverford,What are you even still doing here?
Tom Haverford,Harvest Festival is over.
Tom Haverford,Shouldn't you be back in Indianapolis?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works."
Leslie Knope,And he's a valuable asset to the team.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,April has not presented her idea.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,I didn't come up with anything.
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,"Because I know that whatever we come up with isn't gonna be good enough anyway, and we're just gonna go with your idea."
Ron Swanson,She's got a point.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us what your idea is so I can go back to the Thunderdome."
Tom Haverford,That's what I'm calling my tent.
Leslie Knope,I am really disappointed in all of you.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the whole town is looking at us right now."
Leslie Knope,And you're letting 'em down.
Leslie Knope,Take an hour.
Leslie Knope,Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.
Leslie Knope,"And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department."
Leslie Knope,"Then, after that, I will tell you my idea."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,You really let 'em have it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I had no choice."
Leslie Knope,I didn't wanna tell them my idea.
Ann Perkins,Why not?
Leslie Knope,Because I don't have one.
Leslie Knope,"I don't have an idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so screwed, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything."
Ann Perkins,Why not just build the park on the lot behind my house?
Leslie Knope,Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.
Ann Perkins,What about those binders in your office?
Leslie Knope,They're filled with small ideas.
Leslie Knope,"We need a big, juicy idea."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me."
Ann Perkins,"""I married Alf and we're pretty happy."""
Ann Perkins,That sounds nice.
Leslie Knope,It was.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, listen to me."
Ann Perkins,"You are smart and creative and talented, and you're gonna be fine."
Leslie Knope,You're probably right.
Leslie Knope,I just need an hour and it'll come to me.
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
April Ludgate,"Andy, you have to save me."
April Ludgate,I'm camping with people I work with.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,April.
April Ludgate,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Walk around in circles like I am.
Andy Dwyer,Help triangulate the phone call.
Andy Dwyer,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Hang on.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna try to get to higher ground.
Andy Dwyer,I found some thorns.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, yes, my daughter might think she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend."
Jerry Gergich,"But I'm sorry, 16, that just seems too young to be on birth control."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity."
Ron Swanson,What say we just stand here in silence and think of ideas for projects?
Jerry Gergich,You know what I should do?
Jerry Gergich,I should lead a teen abstinence workshop.
Ron Swanson,That might be incredibly effective.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,One second.
Tom Haverford,I'm just in the middle of a head massage.
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a good stopping point."
Tom Haverford,What's up?
Ben Wyatt,You wanna bounce some ideas off each other?
Tom Haverford,Here's a better idea.
Tom Haverford,How about I bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little Season Six of Top Chef?
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Tom Haverford,I know Leslie seems upset.
Tom Haverford,"But the truth is, she's better than us at this stuff by a thousand miles."
Tom Haverford,"So, there's really no point."
Tom Haverford,Care for some fondue?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,How do you afford all this stuff?
Tom Haverford,I just return it the next day and claim it was defective.
Tom Haverford,The key is crying a lot.
Tom Haverford,No one likes to hear a grown man cry.
Tom Haverford,"""And then, my hand accidentally went in the panini press!"""
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You wanna go for a walk?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,The sky is really beautiful.
Leslie Knope,It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.
Leslie Knope,"It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal."
Leslie Knope,I'm probably making too much out of it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's really big.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you got everyone's attention with the Harvest Festival."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you're gonna seal the deal."
Ben Wyatt,It's the chance you've been waiting for.
Leslie Knope,"What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that?"
Ben Wyatt,Then you wouldn't be Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no."
Ben Wyatt,Not at all.
Ben Wyatt,I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're like the Energizer Bunny of city government."
Ron Swanson,"And when she looked in the back of her car, she saw that even though it was her own private property, she would be forced to take it in for a state inspection!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."
Leslie Knope,Listen up.
Donna Meagle,What was that?
Leslie Knope,That was me talking.
April Ludgate,"No, I heard it, too."
April Ludgate,Andy?
Tom Haverford,"If that's a coyote, someone needs to pick me up off the ground now."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt, What are you doing here?
Chris Traeger," I was just out for my night time run, and I thought, ""Why not go visit the Parks Department?"" How's everything going here?"
Leslie Knope,Super great.
Leslie Knope, Really well.
Leslie Knope, We have a great idea.
Chris Traeger, Tell me now while I sit on this boulder.
Chris Traeger, I'm much more receptive to new ideas when my heart rate is still elevated.
Ann Perkins," Chris, do you wanna maybe just talk for a minute? Let them work?"
Chris Traeger,Oh! Sure.
Andy Dwyer, What was that? What was that? 
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us your idea."
Tom Haverford," Los Angeles, Season One isn't gonna watch itself."
Leslie Knope, Here it is.
Leslie Knope, What do you think? I don't have an idea.
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope," I thought if we all worked really hard, I could come up with something."
Leslie Knope," But I don't have anything, and we're totally screwed."
Leslie Knope, And what we need to do is just keep working and just work again more and just do it and get it.
Leslie Knope, And then we got it and we're good.
Leslie Knope, Go with that.
Ron Swanson, I think I'm gonna turn in.
Leslie Knope, You're not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope, No one's going anywhere.
Leslie Knope, No one's sleeping because this is an all-nighter.
Leslie Knope, And that'll be fun.
Leslie Knope," We'll all stay up and then, I'll be like, ""Hey! No one sleep!"" Do you hear how loud that is? You're not sleeping through that."
April Ludgate, Is there anything else to eat? The marshmallows are all gone.
Ron Swanson, We have nothing to eat.
Ron Swanson, Jerry scared all the fish away with his loud personal stories.
Donna Meagle, I wanna go home.
Donna Meagle, I miss my canopy bed.
April Ludgate, Yeah.
April Ludgate, I'm fine with not camping.
April Ludgate, Especially since my stupid boyfriend abandoned me!
Ron Swanson, I'll fire up the van.
Chris Traeger," You know, I've never moved this slowly before."
Chris Traeger, It's almost like being in quicksand.
Ann Perkins," Hey, um, listen."
Ann Perkins," When you dumped me, it was really embarrassing."
Ann Perkins, You just kind of took off.
Chris Traeger," Oh, I'm so sorry."
Chris Traeger," I mean, I never meant to hurt you."
Chris Traeger," And well, I'm back now."
Chris Traeger," Hey, I have a great idea."
Chris Traeger, Why don't we go to this rustic diner that I know? We can have egg white omelets and we can continue to talk about us.
Ann Perkins, Sounds good.
Ron Swanson," No, no."
Tom Haverford, Chocolate or butterscotch?
Ben Wyatt,Swirl me.
Ben Wyatt," Dude, camping is awesome."
Ben Wyatt, I love it.
Ron Swanson," Excuse me, gentlemen."
Ron Swanson, How long have you been running power to this tent? 
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford, How long have we been here?
Ron Swanson,Ten hours.
Tom Haverford, No! I was TiVoing Cupcake Wars.
Ron Swanson, This is ridiculous!
Tom Haverford,"Look, I am used to a certain level of comfort in my life, and I didn't want to sacrifice that."
Jerry Gergich," Okay, well, I packed everything up."
Jerry Gergich," So, now, you're telling me I have to go unpack it?"
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is a sign."
Leslie Knope," You wanted to leave, and now you're stuck here with me."
Leslie Knope," So, we can work all night."
Leslie Knope, This is gonna be so much fun! All night work! All night work! All night work! 
Jerry Gergich,You know what? There's a bed and breakfast right up the road.
Jerry Gergich, I'm gonna head there.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Leslie Knope, Let's keep brainstorming.
Leslie Knope, I have a good feeling about this B&B.
Leslie Knope," One day, there's gonna be a plaque there that reads, ""This is where Leslie Knope came up with the amazing idea for"" Damn, I thought that would work."
Elsa Clack,Welcome to the quiet corn. I'm Elsa Clack.
Elsa Clack,Breakfast is served between 5:30 and 6:15 a.m.
April Ludgate,What if we sleep to a normal hour?
Elsa Clack,Well that would be very rude of you.
Elsa Clack,"May I take your breakfast order? We have hard-boiled eggs, homemade tomato slices with dry seed and leek jam, and your choice of German muffin."
Ron Swanson,What the [bleep] is a German muffin?
Ben Wyatt,Oh good Lord.
Tom Haverford,I call the bed.
Ben Wyatt,Awesome.
Tom Haverford,I hate this place. This place is the exact opposite of Sky Mall.
Ben Wyatt,Oh listen to this.
Ben Wyatt,"""Dear Quiet Corn, thank you for your beautiful inn. My wife and I spent three nights of ecstasy in this room."""
April Ludgate,There are no TVs anywhere.
April Ludgate,This place is lamer than outside.
Donna Meagle,I'm chilling.
April Ludgate,What is that?
Donna Meagle,Gin.
Andy Dwyer,"Sleeping in a tent, I'm sleeping in the tent."
April Ludgate,Oh my God.
Andy Dwyer,"Found you, oh I found you."
Andy Dwyer,and I had to fight a squirrel.
April Ludgate,Where have you been?
Andy Dwyer,"Told you I was gonna take you camping, didn't I?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'm taking you camping. This is what I had set up at the other camp site."
Andy Dwyer,Except it was way nicer there.
Andy Dwyer,"But this will do. I have some champagne, and I had to drink most of it to survive, so I'm kind of buzzed right now."
April Ludgate,I'm just glad you're here. Can we make out now?
Chris Traeger,"You have to understand that at the time, I genuinely thought that you and I would never see each other again."
Ann Perkins,I complete understand.
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's what makes you so amazing."
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, amazing."
Chris Traeger,Oh no.
Ann Perkins,Oh no?
Ann Perkins,Oh no.
Chris Traeger,I wasn't saying that I thought we should get back together again.
Ann Perkins,"But you said that, you indicated that, oh my God this is happening again."
Ann Perkins,I have to move right?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm gonna leave the country."
Ann Perkins,"Bye everybody, bye."
Ron Swanson,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, couldn't sleep?"
Ron Swanson,"No, my room is filled with cat hair and cat smell."
Ron Swanson,"And actually cats, roughly twelve cats."
Leslie Knope,Sounds delightful.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,"I am listening to ""Steal My Sunshine"" by Len, a one-hit wonder like me."
Ron Swanson,You're not a one-hit wonder.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will be."
Leslie Knope,"I peaked at the Harvest Festival, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Years from now, people are gonna say, ""Remember that woman that came up with the harvest festival idea? """
Leslie Knope,And never came up with another idea again? What happened to her?
Leslie Knope,"What was her name? Kim? Anyway, who cares, she's stupid and she's dead."
Leslie Knope,"For the first time ever, the Parks department has real momentum and I'm gonna ruin it for everybody."
Ron Swanson,You've done more for this group of people than anyone else.
Ron Swanson,You're the only reason we all still have jobs.
Ron Swanson,I think we'll be okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well okay, I would love to chit-chat about this, but I need to keep working and keep pushing, so my breakthrough will happen and I will be ready for it."
Ron Swanson,"You know what, I just had an idea for a new project."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I think this could be really really good."
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
Ron Swanson,Right through here.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's happening?"
Leslie Knope,Ron. Ron what are you doing?
Ron Swanson,"This is my idea. You're gonna shut your brain down and go to sleep, and I'm gonna stay out here and guard the door so you can't leave."
Leslie Knope,No Ron.
Ron Swanson,"You've been thinking about work nonstop for years, it's time to rest."
Leslie Knope,All my binders are downstairs.
Ron Swanson,"All due respect Ms. Clack, stick a German muffin in it."
Leslie Knope,"Fair enough, I'm just gonna go to bed, call it a night."
Ron Swanson,"I already checked Leslie, the transom is painted shut."
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, there's like fifty cats in here."
Chris Traeger,Where's Leslie?
Ron Swanson,Not 100% sure.
Ben Wyatt,Should we reschedule or?
Ron Swanson,"Nope, she'll be here."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,"So I just slept 7 hours, which is twice as long as I usually sleep, so I'm little disoriented."
Leslie Knope,"But I did wake up with a million ideas, and Ron would not let me have any paper, so I had to write them down on this doily."
Leslie Knope,We should buy a telescope and make the old ranger station in Ramsett Park an observatory.
Leslie Knope,"That way, we could sell tickets and have class trips."
Chris Traeger,I like it.
Leslie Knope,"Good. We'll have theme night at the park. Have singles, date night, seniors."
Leslie Knope,We could have a city-wide yard sale.
Leslie Knope,"Which could be part auction, part antique roadshow, then we could have professors come in and assign value to the objects."
Leslie Knope,"We could split the profits with the school, it'd be a lot of fun."
Ron Swanson,I'll see you boys later.
Leslie Knope,Bye Ron.
Leslie Knope,They say you're only as good as your last idea.
Leslie Knope,I say you're only as good as the people you work with.
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope is back.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God my breath is so bad.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah she died like 20 minutes after that.

,Season: 3 Episode: 09
Ben Wyatt,"So, while they repaint the lines in the parking lot, we're asking everyone to do street parking."
Donna Meagle,I'm not street parking my Mercedes.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, everyone is."
Ben Wyatt,I'm doing it.
Donna Meagle,'Cause nobody wants to steal a Saturn.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, moving on to recycling."
Ben Wyatt,"You okay, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,Just a little tooth pain.
Ron Swanson,I'm fine.
Ron Swanson,Continue.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, each department will be getting blue bins Do you need to go to the dentist, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,I don't like dentists.
Ron Swanson,Just a second.
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,No!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no!"
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Donna Meagle,What the?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, everybody."
Ron Swanson,What were we talking about?
Ron Swanson,Recycling?
Ron Swanson,Dentist pulled the tooth out yesterday.
Ron Swanson,But it's always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.
Ron Swanson,"Plus, it's always fun to see Tom faint."
Andy Dwyer,"Attention, everybody!"
April Ludgate,"Everybody, listen up."
Andy Dwyer,"You are all officially invited to a dinner party, which is officially my friend Burly's home, because I don't have a home."
April Ludgate,That's it.
April Ludgate,There's no more left.
Andy Dwyer,Give it to him.
April Ludgate,"We've been dating for almost a month, so we just decided that we wanted to do something special."
Andy Dwyer,"And dinner parties do combine two of our favorite things, dinner and parties."
April Ludgate,Parties.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It's like if you could have a Xbox pancake.
Andy Dwyer,"Your invitations include requests for each of you to bring stuff, 'cause we don't have a whole lot."
Andy Dwyer,Don't be late.
April Ludgate,Watch out.
Tom Haverford,"""Dearest Tom, please bring silverware."""
Donna Meagle,"""Please bring cooked steak."""
Ron Swanson,This is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,They're young.
Leslie Knope,They're in love.
Leslie Knope,They're ready to show it to the world.
Leslie Knope,It's very sweet.
Leslie Knope,And we're all going.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,There's a boy's sale at Dillard's today.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,You going tonight?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently they want me to bring Avatar, and 50 pairs of 3D glasses, and a 3D capable television."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will see you there, with all of those things."
Leslie Knope,I was actually coming to see you.
Leslie Knope,I wanted your advice on something.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Ben Wyatt,"My boss in Indianapolis, he wants me back on the road in a week."
Ben Wyatt,"But then this morning, Chris offered me a job to stay here in Pawnee and work for him."
Leslie Knope,Do you wanna do that?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,I've been moving around so much the past few years.
Ben Wyatt,It might be nice to stay in one place for a while.
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is a great city."
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's definitely the best city in Indiana, probably America, possibly the world."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"But on the other hand, you've put in 12 years with the state government."
Ben Wyatt,So you think I should say no to Chris and head back to Indianapolis or?
Leslie Knope, It's a tough call.
Leslie Knope,You know what I would do?
Leslie Knope,You should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,That always works for me.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, maybe I'll do that."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,Nice talking to you.
Ben Wyatt,Good stuff.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,So how does this work?
Extra,"All right, you just fill out your name tag, and you're all set."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"But I mean, do I just go up and talk to anyone, or do I wait for them to talk to me, or?"
Extra,Are you asking me how to flirt with men?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,It's a whole new Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"I'm putting myself out there, meeting some new people, having some casual fun, and it is awkward."
Jerry Gergich,Gayle went out and got me this new party shirt.
Jerry Gergich,"So be honest, what do you guys think?"
Tom Haverford,"You know what, Jerry?"
Tom Haverford,"I make fun of you a lot, but credit where credit is due."
Tom Haverford,"You know, I like how the Damn it."
Tom Haverford,I was so close.
Tom Haverford,It's a terrible shirt.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope,April's friend Orin is here.
Leslie Knope,He's very intense and very weird.
Leslie Knope,"So if you end up talking to him, just make sure you don't reveal anything personal about yourself."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, gang."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,What'd you bring?
Chris Traeger,I was in charge of the cake.
Chris Traeger,"To be fair, it's not a cake so much as it is a vegetable loaf."
Chris Traeger,"You got your mushrooms, your alfalfa sprouts, your spinach, and I had it sweetened with fruit reduction."
Ron Swanson,But did they ask you to bring a vegetable loaf or a cake?
Leslie Knope,"No, a cake, but this is so much healthier."
Ron Swanson,"So not only does this thing exist, but now you have deprived everyone of cake."
Leslie Knope,"Take a walk, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ann Perkins,Donna.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I am so excited to see you here.
Ann Perkins,These things are horrible when you're by yourself.
Ann Perkins,What?
Donna Meagle,Do you know where you are right now?
Donna Meagle,We're in the jungle.
Donna Meagle,There are no friends here.
Donna Meagle,It's every woman for herself.
Ann Perkins,"You're joking, right?"
Donna Meagle,Do I look like I'm joking?
Donna Meagle,Dating is a zerosum game.
Donna Meagle,"If you get a man, I don't get that man."
Ann Perkins,I'm here because of advice that you gave me to be more adventurous in my life.
Donna Meagle,Here's some more advice.
Donna Meagle,Beat it.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Ben, heard you might be leaving Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking about it.
Tom Haverford,"Well, you are a huge nerd."
Tom Haverford,"But I'd be sorry to see you go, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this party needs a little help."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right back.
Tom Haverford,"So are you going on, like, a yearIong walking tour of the set of The Lord of the Rings in New Zealand?"
Ben Wyatt,"To be honest with you, I wasn't a fan of Peter Jackson's interpretation."
Ben Wyatt,So you can put that one away.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think you maybe should put some more food out."
Andy Dwyer,Totally agree.
Andy Dwyer,Just firing up the Bagel Bites now.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,What do you think?
Andy Dwyer,"April, you're not supposed to let me see you."
April Ludgate,"No, come on."
April Ludgate,You have to look.
April Ludgate,This is important.
April Ludgate,You have to tell me if I look good.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
Andy Dwyer,Uh It's supposed to be a big surprise.
Andy Dwyer,"But tonight, me and April are getting married."
Andy Dwyer,To each other.
Leslie Knope,Is April pregnant?
Leslie Knope,Are you pregnant?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Yes?
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,Are you sick?
Leslie Knope,Are you terminal?
Leslie Knope,Is it like that movie A Walk to Remember?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,God.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,Why is this great thing happening?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, it's actually a really funny story."
Andy Dwyer,We were hanging out.
Andy Dwyer,"And suddenly, I was like, ""What if we got married tomorrow?"""
Andy Dwyer,"And she was like ""Fine."""
Andy Dwyer,"She's like, ""Fine."
Leslie Knope,That is a great story.
Leslie Knope,"But you guys haven't been together very long, and you have no place to live."
April Ludgate,"We've been together long enough, and we'll find a place to live."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Like, a house or, like, a condo or something."
Andy Dwyer,Probably a condo.
Leslie Knope,You can't just get a condo.
Andy Dwyer,"No, you're right."
Andy Dwyer,House.
Leslie Knope,I love Andy and April as a couple.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together forever.
Leslie Knope,But relationships need planning.
Leslie Knope,You just can't jump into something without thinking.
Leslie Knope,"It took me four years to find the right hairdresser, and we still fight all the time!"
Leslie Knope,Andy and April are gonna surprise people with a secret ceremony.
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,Secret wedding.
Tom Haverford,Julia Roberts pulled the same move.
Ron Swanson,Is that that toothy girl from Mystic Pizza?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, I need you to help me knock some sense into them."
Ron Swanson,It's not really my place.
Ron Swanson,Or yours.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann.
Extra,Brian.
Ann Perkins,What's your occupation?
Extra,I'm a manager at a sporting goods store.
Ann Perkins,No way.
Ann Perkins,"Me, too."
Extra,Seriously?
Extra,Which one?
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not."
Ann Perkins,I was just ribbing you.
Extra,What are you drinking?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Extra,What?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I don't know."
Ann Perkins,I couldn't hear you.
Extra,"So you just laughed and said, ""Yeah""?"
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,Excuse us.
Donna Meagle,That was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
Donna Meagle,Did you grow up in the woods?
Donna Meagle,Are you Nell from the movie Nell?
Ann Perkins,I told you I'm rusty.
Donna Meagle,"All right, come with me."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"I know what's going down, and I'm so happy for you guys."
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, something just occurred to me."
Tom Haverford,Can I be your best man?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, dude, totally."
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,My best man.
Tom Haverford,Best man!
Tom Haverford,One of my life goals is to be a best man.
Tom Haverford,It's a baller position.
Tom Haverford,You get drunk.
Tom Haverford,You make speeches.
Tom Haverford,"And you make love to the prettiest bridesmaid, usually standing, from behind."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know that I cannot tell you what to do."
Leslie Knope,"I know it doesn't work, from all the times I've tried to tell you what to do before."
Leslie Knope,But you know what would be fun?
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should make a pros and cons list.
Leslie Knope,"Let me take you home, and then we'll go do that together."
Leslie Knope,It'll be a blast.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, relax."
Leslie Knope,You relax.
Leslie Knope,You relax all the way home and get into bed.
Leslie Knope,You need to go to bed.
Andy Dwyer,April.
Andy Dwyer,Girl talk.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, what's your middle name?"
Andy Dwyer,The justice of the peace lady needs to know.
Leslie Knope,You don't know each other's middle names?
April Ludgate,I don't wanna say it out loud.
Andy Dwyer,Ew.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,Roberta!
April Ludgate,Such a loser.
April Ludgate,Can't believe I'm marrying him.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.
April Ludgate,I'm going to.
April Ludgate,And then I'm gonna divorce him.
April Ludgate,Then I'm gonna marry him again.
Leslie Knope,"One time, I fell madly in love with a Civil War reenactor that I had only known for six hours."
Leslie Knope,And then I found out he wore those clothes all the time.
Leslie Knope,And he was married.
Leslie Knope,But the clothes thing really bothered me.
Donna Meagle,You always wanna scribble the name.
Donna Meagle,Make 'em read.
Donna Meagle,Draw them in.
Donna Meagle,Make 'em work for it.
Ann Perkins,Right.
Donna Meagle,Two shots of Jameson.
Donna Meagle,Don't make too much eye contact.
Donna Meagle,"You wanna seem available, but not too available."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks."
Ann Perkins,I think I'm good for now.
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna... Yeah.
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, you are so amazing with me and April, stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, man."
Andy Dwyer,Would you be one of my best men?
Ron Swanson,"I'd be honored to, son."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, you helped me get April back."
Andy Dwyer,Would you be my best man?
Chris Traeger,Nothing else in my entire life would make me happier as long as I live.
Andy Dwyer,Jerry.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so glad you made it.
Andy Dwyer,This shirt is hilarious.
Andy Dwyer,"Derek and Ben, will you be my best men?"
Tom Haverford,"Got a little competition for the best man, huh?"
Tom Haverford,"Well, you know what the best best man does."
Tom Haverford,Excuse me!
Tom Haverford,Are there any strippers here?
Tom Haverford,Former strippers?
Tom Haverford,Nondancers but you're feeling a little bit drunk?
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,I'm throwing Andy an impromptu bachelor party.
Tom Haverford,It's my duty as best man.
Ron Swanson,The wedding's in four minutes.
Tom Haverford,It's that kind of negative thinking that makes you a less good best man.
Ann Perkins,Hello?
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Ann, it's Leslie, Leslie Knope from the Parks Department."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I know."
Ann Perkins,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are getting married tonight.
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,"I need you to get down here, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I need you to kiss him again or kiss her or kiss somebody.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"Help me, please!"
Leslie Knope,Relationships are like scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,"If you come up too fast, you get the bends."
Leslie Knope,"And the reason why I know this is because I was dating a guy once, and we were scuba diving, and I told him that I loved him underwater, and he shot up really fast, and he got the bends."
Ben Wyatt,"No, Orin, I don't know how I'm going to die."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,Are you asking me or telling me?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,April and Andy are about to get married.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,My Brita filter's older than their relationship.
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,Should I change my Brita filter?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,It depends on how frequently you use it.
Ben Wyatt,True.
Leslie Knope,"Stay focused, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"The point is two boneheads, whom I love dearly, are about to sacrifice their future 'cause they haven't thought this thing through."
Leslie Knope,And nobody seems concerned about this.
Andy Dwyer,"Attention, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,Mesdames and Missoirs.
Andy Dwyer,"If you would do me the obligation of having your honor, heretofore, in the room doth right over there, hence."
Ron Swanson,What?
Andy Dwyer,"Big event in that room, 15 minutes."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is really happening.
Leslie Knope,I love April and Andy.
Leslie Knope,I want them to stay together.
Leslie Knope,And that is why I have to stop their wedding.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, guys, remember how I told you there was going to be a surprise later?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, the surprise is you are not actually at a dinner party."
Andy Dwyer,You're at our wedding.
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this.
Extra,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to marry Andrew Maxwell Dwyer and April Roberta Ludgate."
April Ludgate,I guess I kind of hate most things.
April Ludgate,But I never really seem to hate you.
April Ludgate,"So, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you."
April Ludgate,Is that cool?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Is it my turn?
Extra,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"""April, you're the most awesome person ""I have ever known in my entire life."
Andy Dwyer,"""I vow to protect you from danger."""
Andy Dwyer,"""I don't care if I have to fight an ultimate fighter, or a bear, or him, your mom, I would take 'em down."""
April Ludgate,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,I'm getting mad right now even thinking about it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm telling you.
April Ludgate,It's okay.
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna spend the rest of my life, every minute, with you."
Andy Dwyer,And I'm the luckiest man in the galaxy.
Extra,And now the rings.
Extra,"By the power vested in me by the State of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife."
Brett,Go fly away.
Harris,Fly!
Harris,Fly!
Brett,Wings of love.
Brett,Okay.
Brett,All right.
Brett,So that one is dead.
Brett,We know that.
Ron Swanson,"You wouldn't have been able to stop it, you know."
Leslie Knope,I could've yelled something or tackled someone.
Ron Swanson,"But you didn't, because deep down, you knew it wouldn't have mattered."
Ron Swanson,Those kids are gonna do what they wanna do.
Leslie Knope,They may have just ruined their lives on an impulse decision.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I got married twice."

Leslie Knope,Can I talk to you for a second?
Tom Haverford,Let me get off the chair.
Leslie Knope,Hey What is wrong with you?
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,It's the workplace.
Tom Haverford,You're being a little bit too feisty right now.
Leslie Knope,You are being a little bit too much of an ass right now.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Knock it off.
Tom Haverford,I can't fight this feeling anymore.
Tom Haverford,"You and I, we're dating."
Leslie Knope,You should be so lucky.
Chris Traeger,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Chris Traeger,Tom.
Leslie Knope,They should fix that.
Leslie Knope,It was all just a joke.
Leslie Knope,"I can assure you, there's nothing romantic going on between me and Tom."
Chris Traeger,I have a very strict policy.
Chris Traeger,"No office relationships, particularly between a supervisor and an employee."
Chris Traeger,The taxpayers pay us.
Chris Traeger,"So, we can't have anything appearing even remotely scandalous."
Chris Traeger,"I'm just saying, if you can't keep your mouth to yourself, I'm gonna have to suspend you."
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Chris Traeger,Look.
Chris Traeger,Cucumber flower.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's so cute."
Chris Traeger,"Wait, that's a garnish."
Chris Traeger,You're not supposed to eat that.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,"So, just type up those ones we talked about, and we'll get it finalized tomorrow."
Jerry Gergich,Yep.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,What was all that stuff with you and Leslie?
Tom Haverford,Girl likes Indian food.
Tom Haverford,What can I say?
Tom Haverford, Fine.
Tom Haverford, We got matched up on an online dating site.
Tom Haverford," And I was messing with her, she got pissed."
Tom Haverford," So, she took me out in the hallway and kissed me, out of revenge."
Ben Wyatt, Really?
Tom Haverford,"And as much as it pains me to admit this, it was not disgusting."
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt," Well, I don't need the details or anything."
Tom Haverford, I'm just saying.
Tom Haverford, She knows what to do.
Ben Wyatt, All right.
Tom Haverford," Like, I was impressed."
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Tom Haverford, It was stirring.
Ben Wyatt, Goodbye.
Tom Haverford, It felt like Yeah.
Tom Haverford, All right.
Tom Haverford," Just Anyway, like I was saying"
Chris Traeger," I humbly place before you my east meets west patented Traeger Turkey Burger, an Asian fusion burger made with Willow Farms organic turkey, a toasted taleggio cheese crisp, papaya chutney, black truffle aioli, and microgreens on a gluten free brioche bun."
Chris Traeger, Enjoy.
Donna Meagle, Mmm.
Tom Haverford, Mmm.
Tom Haverford, This tastes as delicious as Beyonce smells.
Tom Haverford, I'm guessing.
Donna Meagle, What is this in here? Saffron?
Chris Traeger,Wow! Somebody's got a sharp palate.
Kyle, I love the umami flavor.
Jerry Gergich," Stop being so pretentious, Kyle."
Kyle, Sorry.
Ron Swanson, Here's mine.
Ron Swanson," It's a hamburger, made out of meat, on a bun, with nothing."
Ron Swanson, Add ketchup if you want.
Ron Swanson, I couldn't care less.
Chris Traeger," Ron, I am so disappointed."
Chris Traeger, I thought that you and I were gonna have a real challenge.
Tom Haverford, Never mind.
Tom Haverford, This is better.
Donna Meagle, Way better.
Jerry Gergich, Mmm.
Jerry Gergich, Yep.
Jerry Gergich, Mmm-hmm.
Andy Dwyer, Kyle?
Kyle,"Sorry, Andy."
Kyle, Ron's is better.
Andy Dwyer," Damn it, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer," It's so much better, it's crazy."
Ron Swanson," Turkey can never beat cow, Chris."
Ron Swanson, Sorry.
Chris Traeger," Well, I don't understand."
Chris Traeger, I've tinkered with this recipe for years.
Chris Traeger," Granted, it's been a long time since I've had a hamburger."
Chris Traeger, This is better.
Chris Traeger," The commissary will continue to serve horrifying, artery-clogging hamburgers."
Andy Dwyer, Man.
Andy Dwyer," We spent, like, 50 hours working on those burgers."
April Ludgate, I know.
April Ludgate, Hard work never pays off.
Andy Dwyer, Cooking is dumb.
April Ludgate, I swear on this dead crow that I will never cook for you.
Andy Dwyer, I love you.
Chris Traeger, I just wanted to make sure that there were no hard feelings after I forced you to break up with Tom.
Leslie Knope," Oh, we weren't-- No."
Leslie Knope, No hard feelings.
Chris Traeger, 'Cause it's just a real bugaboo of mine.
Chris Traeger, And it applies to everyone.
Chris Traeger," Just the other day, Ben told me that he might want to socialize with somebody from the government and I said, ""I'm sorry. Not possible."""
Leslie Knope,Really? Did he say who?
Chris Traeger,"No, and I didn't ask."
Chris Traeger, Because it's irrelevant.
Chris Traeger, He oversees every department.
Chris Traeger, It simply can't happen.
Chris Traeger, This is literally the best thing I've ever eaten.
Chris Traeger, Mmm.
Chris Traeger, And it's so bad for me.
Chris Traeger, I'm gonna have to jog while I digest this.
Chris Traeger, Excuse me.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, What's up?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey. Well, I think I'm allergic to chutney."
Ben Wyatt," Also, what's chutney?"
Leslie Knope,No clue.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Hey, I never got to tell you the rest of my ideas."
Leslie Knope, You wanna go somewhere and talk about them?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to."
Ben Wyatt," Let me get some actual food, and then, do you know that wildflower mural up on the second floor?"
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah? You wanna meet there?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Sounds good.
Leslie Knope, I don't know if the online thing is for me.
Leslie Knope, I prefer to meet people in person.
Leslie Knope, It's like door number two on Let's Make a Deal.
Leslie Knope," Do you want the thing that you have, that you know you like, but isn't perfect, or do you give it up for what's behind door number two? I think I like what I have."
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna try to make it work with Tom.
Leslie Knope," I'm kidding! All right, be honest, Tom."
Leslie Knope, How did you and I get matched up?
Tom Haverford," I made 26 profiles, each designed to attract a different type of girl."
Tom Haverford, Tom A.
Tom Haverford, Haverford.
Tom Haverford, Sporty and sexy.
Tom Haverford, Tom B.
Tom Haverford," Haverford, smooth and soulful."
Tom Haverford, Which letter did you get? 
Leslie Knope," N, Tom N. Haverford."
Tom Haverford," The N stands for nerd! I never even check that one, 'cause no one ever responds to it."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," Well, whatever."
Tom Haverford, Tom N.  Haverford collects globes.
Leslie Knope, Great.
Leslie Knope, That's enough.
Tom Haverford, His favorite movie is books.
Leslie Knope," Donna? Every time I want you to shut up, from now on."

Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Did I scare you?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to remind you of the art show that's happening tonight at the community center.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that sounds cool."
Ben Wyatt,That sounds like something that will be a big success.
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, like everything that you put your paws on."
Ben Wyatt,Your fingers.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,Ben Wyatt.
Chris Traeger,"Ben, great news."
Chris Traeger,Do you remember the woman I told you about from the county commissioner's office?
Ben Wyatt,Um... Vaguely.
Chris Traeger,Sure you do.
Chris Traeger,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, she's agreed to go out on a date with you."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,You asked her out for me?
Chris Traeger,You're going to love her.
Chris Traeger,"She is interesting, smart and beautiful."
Chris Traeger,Inside and out.
Chris Traeger,Inner beauty is very important.
Chris Traeger,And outer beauty is also very important.
Leslie Knope,I thought you had a rule about intergovernment relationships.
Chris Traeger,Don't worry.
Chris Traeger,Her department is completely separate from ours.
Chris Traeger,This isn't anything like your affair with Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,We weren't You You
Ben Wyatt," I'm sorry, who are you calling?"
Extra,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,Cindy Miller.
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Guess who is standing in this room with me right now.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, uh Ben Wyatt."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, say hello."
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Cindy."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Extra,Hi.
Extra,No apology necessary.
Extra,It's just Chris being Chris.
Ben Wyatt,How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Ooh!
Chris Traeger,Sparks are flying!
Chris Traeger,We may have to call the fire department.
Chris Traeger,It's a government joke.
Chris Traeger,I love setting people up.
Chris Traeger,Here's my secret.
Chris Traeger,"I determine someone's best qualities, and then, I find someone else with compatible qualities, and I bring them together."
Leslie Knope,"God, this sucks."
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just go home for the rest of the day?
Leslie Knope,"I can't go home, because I have this art show opening at the community center, and I can't stay here because I see Ben, and I can't date Ben because of Chris' stupid rules."
Leslie Knope,I feel so
Ann Perkins,Powerless.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm like that light bulb.
Leslie Knope,"Weak, flickering, barely giving off any light, unable to make out with the light bulb I want to make out with."
Ann Perkins,You know what might make you feel better?
Leslie Knope,A hug?
Ann Perkins,Paxil.
Ann Perkins,Do you want me to get you a prescription?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom!"
Ben Wyatt,A question for you.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know anyone who's looking for a roommate?
Tom Haverford,How hot?
Ben Wyatt,I-- What?
Tom Haverford,How hot is the woman that's looking for a place to stay?
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's me."
Ben Wyatt,I'm looking.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,That's not fair.
Tom Haverford,You shouldn't have led me to believe it was a beautiful woman.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't.
Ben Wyatt,I've been staying at the Pawnee Super Suites Motel for seven months.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a charming little inn with wonderfully random wakeup calls, delightfully unstable temperatures, and, as of yesterday, bedbugs."
Ben Wyatt,"""Four stars,"" says nobody."
Tom Haverford,"I wish I could help you, Benihana, but I can't."
Tom Haverford,I have a one bedroom.
Tom Haverford,I can't have a dude sleeping on my couch if and when I bring home a lady.
Tom Haverford,"I have a ritual, and it starts on the couch."
Tom Haverford,"We sit down, clap my hands, lights dim."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I understand.
Tom Haverford,Boyz II Men.
Tom Haverford,Fades in.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, stop."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"No, you don't need to explain the ritual."
Ben Wyatt,I'm good.
Tom Haverford,You know who might be able to help out a homeless dude such as yourself?
Andy Dwyer,This is awesomely perfect.
Andy Dwyer,"Burly just moved in with his rich girlfriend, and we need help with the rent."
April Ludgate,"We have a couple of house rules, though."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, sure."
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
April Ludgate,You can't use the front door.
April Ludgate,You have to climb in through the back window.
April Ludgate,No personal phone conversations.
April Ludgate,"If you ever speak to me in Spanish, please use the formal ""usted""."
April Ludgate,And no electricity after 6:00 p.m.
Andy Dwyer,She's joking.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,You can use as much free electricity as you want.
Andy Dwyer,It's free.
April Ludgate,Couple more rules.
April Ludgate,"If you ever watch a sad movie, you have to wear mascara so we can see whether or not you've been crying."
April Ludgate,"There's no noise allowed on Mondays, and no TV after breakfast."
Andy Dwyer,She is lying again.
Ben Wyatt,She is.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Because it's hard to tell.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"We leave the TV on all day long so burglars think that we're home when we're not, which was my idea that I'm trying to patent."
Andy Dwyer,"So, you want to move in tonight?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,That would be great.
April Ludgate,You want my gum?
Andy Dwyer,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, can you make the opening remarks?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just I'm not in the mood.
Ron Swanson,Neither am I.
Ron Swanson,Ever.
Ron Swanson,What's wrong with you?
Ron Swanson,You live for this kind of stuff.
Leslie Knope,I don't have it in me right now.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Do it for me.
Leslie Knope,Make the speech.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,"Give the speech, Ron."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Please?
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Please.
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Leslie Knope,Please give the speech.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I won't.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ron Swanson,No way.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please, please, please, please."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes"
Ron Swanson,All right!
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, woman."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, everyone."
Ron Swanson,Shut up and look at me!
Ron Swanson,"Welcome to ""Visions of Nature."""
Ron Swanson,This room has several paintings in it.
Ron Swanson,Some are big.
Ron Swanson,Some are small.
Ron Swanson,"People did them, and they are here now."
Ron Swanson,"I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings."
Ron Swanson,Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.
Ron Swanson,I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.
Ron Swanson,"Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further."
Ron Swanson,End of speech.
Andy Dwyer,And that's the TV room.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's a mess."
April Ludgate,Can you throw that in the trash can?
Ben Wyatt,"I was just here, like, three weeks ago for your wedding."
Ben Wyatt,What happened?
April Ludgate,"Well, Burly moved out."
April Ludgate,He was the one that did all the cleaning and throwing away and stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, he moved out, like, a week ago."
Ben Wyatt,You guys made this mess in a week?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I always think April's going to clean up."
April Ludgate,And I never clean up.
Andy Dwyer,"It's cute, right?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
April Ludgate,"Yes, it is."
Ben Wyatt,Are you guys frying marbles?
Andy Dwyer,We were checking to see if the fire alarm worked.
April Ludgate,It doesn't.
Andy Dwyer,The biggest challenge to picking the perfect roommate is finding someone who's willing to pay more than their share of rent without knowing it.
April Ludgate,I think we found that in Ben.
Ron Swanson,"You forgot to paint a painting, son."
Jerry Gergich,"So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag."
Ann Perkins,It's stunning.
Tom Haverford,"It's breathtaking, Jerry."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,It really is.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, guys."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, you should really come over here and look at Jerry's painting."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's me.
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, it does look like you."
Leslie Knope,You're just realizing that now?
Tom Haverford,"That's what you see when you close your eyes at night, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,Topless Leslie glued to a horse.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I am just so, so sorry."
Jerry Gergich,"Dyaphena, she is this powerful goddess, and I've been thinking a lot about powerful women, and subconsciously, I painted you."
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,I'm going to take it right down.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Leave it up.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to explain it.
Leslie Knope,"Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, ""What can't that centaur woman do?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Besides ride an escalator and drive a car."""
Leslie Knope,Art can be so magnificent.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,The baby is Tom.
Tom Haverford,What?
Ann Perkins,This is easily my favorite painting ever.
Tom Haverford,"What the hell, Jerry?"
Tom Haverford,Look at my pot belly.
Tom Haverford,I look like a pregnant baby.
Tom Haverford,And why am I so scared?
Tom Haverford,"All right, we've got to take this down."
Tom Haverford,Now.
Leslie Knope,"No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom."
Leslie Knope,It's staying right here.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow lover of the arts."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the painting.
Extra,"What, is that you?"
Extra,"Well, it's hot."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"This guy's in it, too."
Ann Perkins,He's the little fat baby.
Extra,Cool.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,What's going on right here?
Tom Haverford,Baby rolls!
Tom Haverford,We've been trying to get that light fixed for months.
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Extra,Thank her.
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Tom."
Extra,She marched into my office this morning and told me she wouldn't leave until I got this done.
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm glad someone's feeling good."
Tom Haverford,They're going to hang that painting in a public building where anybody can see it.
Tom Haverford,"In one brush stroke, Jerry has killed the JayZ vibe that's taken me years to cultivate and replaced it with the fat, brown baby vibe, which is not as cool of a vibe."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, Aphrodite."
Donna Meagle,Chris needs you in his office.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,"When you're done with the light, fix the printer."
Extra,I don't know how to fix printers.
Leslie Knope,Learn it.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, should I go, too?"
Leslie Knope,"This isn't about you, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,It's my painting.
Marcia Langman,Why am I upset?
Marcia Langman,Let's start with government funded animal porn.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that's fair.
Marcia Langman,"I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality."
Leslie Knope,Bestiality?
Leslie Knope,"It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse."
Marcia Langman,And how did it get like that?
Marcia Langman,Who had sex with what and gave birth to which?
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution."
Marcia Langman,Destroy it.
Leslie Knope,Destroy it?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, is she serious?"
Leslie Knope,Do you find this personally offensive?
Chris Traeger,"Not personally, no."
Chris Traeger,"No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form."
Chris Traeger,I've dabbled in nude sculpture.
Chris Traeger,I've posed nude.
Chris Traeger,"In college, I was in a nude production of Cats."
Chris Traeger,"But I am not in the nude now, am I?"
Chris Traeger,Because we're in a government building.
Chris Traeger,"And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying."
Chris Traeger,"So, take care of this situation."
Leslie Knope,That painting is not going to be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,Every great work of art contains a message.
Leslie Knope,"And the message of this painting is, ""Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia."""
Andy Dwyer," Morning, roomie."
Andy Dwyer,How did you sleep?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were no bedbugs."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, no bed."
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go buy a bed.
Andy Dwyer,Fork.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"It's pretty cute, right?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you know what ""cute"" means?"
April Ludgate,What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?
Ben Wyatt,What have you guys got against washing dishes?
April Ludgate,"We don't have any dishes, okay?"
April Ludgate,Burly took them all when he left.
April Ludgate,"Now, I bet you feel like a jerk."
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude."
Andy Dwyer,We already spent your money on a new Xbox 360 and more frisbees to eat off of.
Andy Dwyer,You've got to stay.
Ben Wyatt,God.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Here's the deal.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to clean this place up.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"And then, I am going to teach you how to be adults."
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,We'll get to be adults.
April Ludgate,"Gee, golly."
April Ludgate,"Thanks, mister."
Andy Dwyer,Fork.
Perd Hapley,Hello.
Perd Hapley,"I'm Perd Hapley, and welcome to Ya' Heard?"
Perd Hapley,With Perd.
Perd Hapley,Today's show begins now.
Perd Hapley,Is this art or is it pornography?
Perd Hapley,"Here to answer this question is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Perd, it is a beautiful work of art."
Leslie Knope,"Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one."
Perd Hapley,But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.
Perd Hapley,You are the subject of this painting.
Perd Hapley,"Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts."
Leslie Knope,I am not the subject.
Leslie Knope,The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.
Leslie Knope,But it does look a little bit like me.
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Perd Hapley,Absolutely sure?
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"So, you always separate your lights from your darks."
April Ludgate,That's racist.
Ben Wyatt,"And then, you get your laundry-- Where is your laundry detergent?"
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Andy Dwyer,Here we are.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,This is bubble bath.
Ben Wyatt,You guys-- You wash your clothes in bubble bath?
Andy Dwyer,"Bubble bath, clothes soap, same thing."
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, they both make bubbles, so."
Leslie Knope,It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.
Perd Hapley,Okay.
Perd Hapley,Also joining us today is a different person.
Perd Hapley,"Pornographic film actress, Brandi Maxxxx."
Brandi Maxxxx, Pleasure to be here.
Perd Hapley," Brandi, you've starred in over 200 adult films, some of which are very good."
Perd Hapley, When did you get into the business?
Brandi Maxxxx,Last year.
Perd Hapley, Fantastic.
Perd Hapley," Now, this painting right here, art or pornography?"
Brandi Maxxxx,"Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous."
Brandi Maxxxx, What Leslie and I do is obviously art.
Leslie Knope, Hang on.
Leslie Knope, There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.
Brandi Maxxxx," It's okay, Leslie."
Brandi Maxxxx, I got this one.
Brandi Maxxxx,What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.
Brandi Maxxxx," Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or what have you."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Hang on.
Leslie Knope, Pornography is very difficult to define.
Leslie Knope," In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, ""I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it."""
Perd Hapley,"Brandi, how would you define pornography?"
Brandi Maxxxx,"For me, it's when the penis goes in."
Ben Wyatt," All right, we need to do some basic organization."
Ben Wyatt, Where do you put your bills when they come?
April Ludgate, I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.
Andy Dwyer, Which I organize into a pile or stack that I put into the freezer.
Ben Wyatt, Why?
Andy Dwyer,So they won't get lost.
Andy Dwyer, Bingo.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, you have to pay these."
Ben Wyatt, Good thing I didn't lose them.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt, New lesson.
Ben Wyatt, Basic finance.
Ben Wyatt, I'm gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt, I am going to teach you how to open a bank account.
Andy Dwyer, Bank account.
Andy Dwyer, Good.
Tom Haverford," Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford."
Tom Haverford, I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.
Tom Haverford, I totally agree with you that people should be allowed to have sex in public places.
Brandi Maxxxx, You look familiar to me.
Tom Haverford, Maybe you've seen me down at the Snakehole Lounge.
Tom Haverford, I'm a part owner there.
Brandi Maxxxx, That's you.
Brandi Maxxxx, In the painting.
Brandi Maxxxx, You're the fat baby.
Brandi Maxxxx, Aw! That's so cute.
Tom Haverford, Oh.
Tom Haverford, You're into that?
Brandi Maxxxx,No.
Tom Haverford," Damn it, Jerry."
Chris Traeger, Imagine my horror.
Chris Traeger, I'm hanging upside down with my gravity boots watching Perd.
Chris Traeger," I see you with your painting, and I am startled and disappointed."
Leslie Knope," Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film."
Chris Traeger, I urge you not to take that role.
Leslie Knope, I am not going to take the role.
Chris Traeger," That's good to hear, because recently, you've been a little unpredictable."
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.
Jerry Gergich," Thank you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope," Stand down, Jerry."
Leslie Knope, This isn't your fight.
Chris Traeger, You've left me no choice.
Chris Traeger," I have convened a meeting of the Public Arts Commission, and we will abide by their decision."
Leslie Knope, Fine with me.
Leslie Knope, Public Arts Commission.
Leslie Knope, Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.
Leslie Knope, Jackpot.
Chris Traeger,I would just like to introduce myself.
Chris Traeger,"My name is Chris Traeger, and I am a big fan of art."
Tom Haverford,"Council, I am not opposed to pornography."
Tom Haverford,"In fact, you could say I'm definitely for it."
Tom Haverford,"If I had my laptop right now, I would show you a well-hidden folder with gigabytes of proof."
Tom Haverford,"However, this thing is disgusting and wrong."
Extra,Please let the record reflect that the fat baby is referring to the painting.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I am not a fat baby."
Tom Haverford,"I'm a small, slender man, similar to actor Taye Diggs."
Tom Haverford,So let the record reflect that.
Tom Haverford,That I look like Tay Diggs.
Leslie Knope,"Members of the Public Art Commission, good afternoon and good art."
Leslie Knope,Every great society has always supported artistic expression.
Leslie Knope,The Romans.
Marcia Langman,Perverts.
Leslie Knope,The Greeks.
Marcia Langman,Gay perverts.
Leslie Knope,Two great societies in Europe.
Marcia Langman,Europeans.
Leslie Knope,"There are some members of this community that would like to demonize this painting, and when they do they in fact demonize art itself."
Leslie Knope,What is or isn't art is up to every free thinking American to decide on their own.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's in the bag."
Leslie Knope,We've decided that the painting should be destroyed.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, burn it."
Leslie Knope,What are you serious?
Leslie Knope,You're supposed to be in favor of public art.
Extra,"Yeah but there's nipples in it, so I figure we ought to be safe and destroy it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here is a list of errands and things that human adults need."
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm giving you an advance on next month's rent, and I want you guys to go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and get everything on that list."
April Ludgate,Or we can buy a Wii.
Ben Wyatt,You can handle this.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know man, why don't you just handle it?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, I can't, I have a date."
April Ludgate,What's his name?
Ben Wyatt,"It's actually not, Chris set it up."
Ben Wyatt,Never mind.
Ben Wyatt,"Point is, stick to the list and you'll do great."
Ben Wyatt,I have total faith in you.
Ben Wyatt,There's like a 30% chance they'll both die.
Marcia Langman,So how do you want to do this?
Marcia Langman,Burn it publicly or burn it privately and I put the footage on my blog
Leslie Knope,"You've made your point, okay"
Leslie Knope,Look this painting is very important to me
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't need to hang in a government building, just let me take it home and I'll keep it there."
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Marcia Langman,"I say, this painting is going to burn."
Marcia Langman,"First here, then in hell."
Marcia Langman,Do I need to get this validated?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Marcia Langman,"Okay, I'll just pull my car around and you can load it in the back."
Leslie Knope,No.
Marcia Langman,"Hey, come back here."
Leslie Knope,"Make me stag, I am Diaphena."
Andy Dwyer,This place is amazing.
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have a thing that makes sherbet, we need five of those."
Andy Dwyer,"No, we need to stick with what's on the list."
Andy Dwyer,"First things first, oven mitts."
Andy Dwyer,Where are the oven mitts?
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have all the as seen on TV stuff."
April Ludgate,Shake weight.
April Ludgate,Iron gym.
April Ludgate,Miracle hand repair.
April Ludgate,Big top cookie.
April Ludgate,Pillow pet.
April Ludgate,Slap chop.
April Ludgate,Oh my god a gopher pick up
Andy Dwyer,"Honey listen to me, get it all."
Andy Dwyer,"Grab everything that we've seen on TV, put it in this cart right now."
Andy Dwyer,"Iron gym, I am going to get so buff."
April Ludgate,"Oh my god, marshmallow shooter"
Andy Dwyer,"Marshmallow shooter, get two."
April Ludgate,Wait what about the magic bullet?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I've seen that."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"I was at a meeting around the corner and some people wanted to destroy this painting, so I brought it here."
Leslie Knope,Where is Andy and April?
Ben Wyatt,They're out shopping.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Ben Wyatt,I moved into the spare room.
Leslie Knope,"Really, huh"
Leslie Knope,Can I come in?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah sure of course."
Ben Wyatt,Why do they want to destroy it.
Leslie Knope,Well it's a painting of me as a centaur.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And it's a nude.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Just basically like the chestal region, mostly."
Leslie Knope,You don't have to look at it if you don't want to.
Ben Wyatt,No no no.
Leslie Knope,It's very classy.
Ben Wyatt,"yeah no, I'm sure it is."
Leslie Knope,"Oh man it's chris, I'm gonna take this."
Leslie Knope,Hi Chris.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope, you need to bring that painting back."
Leslie Knope,What painting?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have the painting, and you need to bring it back in."
Chris Traeger,"I think I've been pretty fair with you, and I'm beginning to feel angry."
Chris Traeger,"and I don't like feeling angry, my heart is racing, it's going at literally 45 beats per minute."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, if I could just explain to you my point of view."
Chris Traeger,"You will bring that painting in tomorrow morning, and surrender it to Marcia Langman, and that's that."
Chris Traeger,Do you understand me madam?
April Ludgate,Mighty Putty.
Andy Dwyer,What are we doing?
Andy Dwyer,We didn't get a single thing that Ben told us to.
April Ludgate,Sure we did.
April Ludgate,We got the marshmallow shooter.
Andy Dwyer,I don't think that's on the list.
April Ludgate,But I want it.
Andy Dwyer,I want it too.
Andy Dwyer,But I also kind of want my own fork.
Andy Dwyer,"Because you eat really slow, which is cute, but also super annoying."
April Ludgate,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,"What, what's wrong?"
April Ludgate,"Nothing, it's just adults are boring, and I hate them, and I don't want to buy all this stupid boring adult stuff and become boring adults."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey listen to me, yes we're going to get a dish rack and shower curtains and a cutting board, but if you think for one seond I'm not also going to get that marshmallow shooter so I can shoot you in the face with marshmallows while you sleep, then you're the dumbest woman I know."
April Ludgate,You're going to make me cry.
Leslie Knope,You're a level-headed person.
Leslie Knope,What do I do here?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, it is one of the basic rules of government that you shouldn't offend people."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
Leslie Knope,I'm so annoyed by all these rules lately.
Ben Wyatt,Me too.
April Ludgate,Come back here.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey Leslie, what are you doing here?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I stole a painting, and I was hoping you guys would help me hide it."
Andy Dwyer,"I like it, it's very simple."
Leslie Knope,No it's on the other side.
April Ludgate,"Oh my God, is that you as a naked horse."
Leslie Knope,Does that look like me I don't even
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, not to be inappropriate or anything, because you're my boss and my friend, but I would totally hit that."
April Ludgate,So would I.
Leslie Knope,You guys are sweet.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I should go, hit the road with this and..."
Ben Wyatt,Okay
Leslie Knope,I'll see you later.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,Bye Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"So, how did we do?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, does this answer your question."
Ben Wyatt,"No, did you buy plates"
Andy Dwyer,Oh plates.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie what are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Say goodbye to Diaphena, I have to turn her over to stupid Marcia Langman."
Jerry Gergich,"Really, wow."
Leslie Knope,What?
Jerry Gergich,I mean to be honest that seems like the kind of thing I would do and I didn't think you would give in.
Leslie Knope,Come with me.
Ben Wyatt,Hey man.
Andy Dwyer,"Roomie, dude, super fun to eat cereal from a bowl with a spoon."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for that.
Ben Wyatt,No problem.
Ben Wyatt,Though you know you're not supposed to bring your dishes into work right.
Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.
Andy Dwyer,What's going on between you and Leslie?
Andy Dwyer,I noticed a weird vibe when we came into the room.
Ben Wyatt,"Nothing, we're friends, just regular friendship development."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, roomie, you can tell me, I bet there's something."
Andy Dwyer,I bet you I can guess what it is.
Andy Dwyer,She stole money from you.
Ben Wyatt,"What, no, no, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,She did not.
Ben Wyatt,I think we like each other.
Ben Wyatt,"But Chris has this very strict rule, coworkers can't date."
Ben Wyatt,So it's not even an option.
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Well first of all, Leslie, she's like the coolest ever, you've chosen well."
Andy Dwyer,"and secondly, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen."
Andy Dwyer,"Look at me and April, if you're anything like us, three weeks from now, you'll be married my friend."
Marcia Langman,"I'm glad you finally came to your senses, I'm sure that's not an easy journey for you to make."
Leslie Knope,Let's take a look at it first shall we?
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, it looks amazing."
Leslie Knope,I had the artist paint over the original.
Leslie Knope,Feel free to destroy it.
Tom Haverford,No.
Leslie Knope,But I think you'll find no one could possibly be offended.
Leslie Knope,Unless of course they have a problem with centaurs having modern haircuts.
Leslie Knope,"There were many kinds of Greek goddesses, some were lovers, some were warriors, and some were tricksters."
Chris Traeger,"I am so glad that this got resolved, because I hate being angry."
Chris Traeger,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Come in here.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,How did your date with Cindy go?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, she wasn't really my type."
Chris Traeger,Well she was a tall brunette.
Chris Traeger,You always like tall brunettes.
Ben Wyatt,Not exclusively.
Chris Traeger,"Historically yes, exclusively."
Leslie Knope,"He said he didn't like her, so it's over."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, well, I'm going to keep trying, because you are incredible."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,and you deserve someone amazing and smart and beautiful.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,A real goddess.
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, what about Shelly from the health food store."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know who that is.
Chris Traeger,Her brother died climbing Everest.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Chris Traeger,Interesting right.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Donna Meagle,Nice job Jerry.
April Ludgate,You look Enrique Iglesias.
Jerry Gergich,Just wish I had more time.
Tom Haverford,"Why, this is amazing, it looks like me and I look awesome."
Andy Dwyer,Is your penis between the front arms or the back legs?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, where's your penis?"
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Gayle, I know Jerry is your husband."
Leslie Knope,Look I can promise you there's absolutely nothing going on between us.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I did not pose for that painting, but thank you for thinking I did."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, sure, hold on"
Tom Haverford,"Gayle, sweetheart, you have nothing to worry about, okay."
Tom Haverford,"I'm not gay, neither is Jerry, and I didn't pose for him."
Tom Haverford,"I promise you hon, Jerry only has eyes for you."
Tom Haverford,"and pound cake, am I right?"

Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Morning.
Ron Swanson,"I know how much you enjoy paperwork, but don't hover."
Leslie Knope,Nice bench.
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Leslie Knope,"No, that's been there since the '90s."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing for your birthday on Friday?
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,I never Aha!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"Birthday, birthday, birthday It's your birthday It's your birthday, and I know when it is."
Leslie Knope,Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is.
Leslie Knope,He's even had it redacted on all government documents.
Leslie Knope,"Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a well placed bribe to a gentleman at Baskin-Robbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday."
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ron Swanson,I was so careful.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you blew it."
Leslie Knope,All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.
Leslie Knope,"Was it worth it, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,Was it?
Ron Swanson,I command you to do nothing.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna do nothing.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do something.
Leslie Knope,And it's gonna be really big.
Leslie Knope,I have a lot of years to make up for.
Ron Swanson,"I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me."
Ron Swanson,"Plus, the whole thing is a scam."
Ron Swanson,Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.
Tom Haverford,They put up a fence.
Leslie Knope,Who?
Leslie Knope,No!
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Leslie Knope,"There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and--"
Tom Haverford,Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.
Tom Haverford,There's even a security guard.
Tom Haverford,You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.
Donna Meagle,Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.
Donna Meagle,And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.
Donna Meagle,With a Harman Kardon Logic surround sound system.
Ben Wyatt,Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground?
Leslie Knope,"Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."
Andy Dwyer,Who?
Leslie Knope,Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.
Leslie Knope,We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.
Leslie Knope,"Then she went to work in Eagleton and ""fixed her deviated septum"" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else."
Leslie Knope,What was it again?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Her soul.
Ben Wyatt,Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side?
Leslie Knope,"To be fair, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.
Leslie Knope,But it has a lot of heart.
April Ludgate,That's what people always say when something sucks.
Leslie Knope,"We should stand up for our town, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier."
Tom Haverford,People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.
Tom Haverford,I would never set foot over there.
Tom Haverford,"But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I am on ""Operation No More Fence,"" so I'm putting you in charge of ""Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe."""
April Ludgate,I am all over it.
Leslie Knope,I just need you to do what's on that list.
Ron Swanson,Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.
Ron Swanson,But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.
Extra,It's the only park in our neighborhood.
Extra,"I mean, where are my kids supposed to play, the rock quarry?"
Extra,There's rocks in there.
Extra,Why don't we just set fire to the fence?
Extra,"You know, set it ablaze."
Leslie Knope,That's arson.
Extra,"Well, let's leave that up to the lawyers."
Extra,"The point is, it would work."
Extra,Why don't we build a fence around their fence?
Extra,Why?
Extra,"It would give us two fences, so if they needed to get to their fence for maintenance and whatnot, their pants might get caught."
Extra,"My son Joey tried to scale that fence to play on the Eagleton side, and he fell and hurt his arm."
Extra,You need to get those people to tear that fence down.
Leslie Knope,This woman's right.
Leslie Knope,"I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence."
Extra,"Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one more time that we burn it down."
Extra,But whatever you guys think.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Great.
April Ludgate,"Yes, hi."
April Ludgate,I have a question about your inflatable saxophones.
April Ludgate,Do those come in different sizes?
April Ludgate,I'm gonna need about 40 dozen of those.
April Ludgate,"Also, what about your neon gangster fedora hats?"
April Ludgate,That was rude.
Ron Swanson,"Whatever's going on here, stop it immediately."
April Ludgate,I was just talking on the phone.
Ron Swanson,To whom?
April Ludgate,It was personal.
April Ludgate,I would never make a workrelated call.
April Ludgate,You know that.
Leslie Knope,Lindsay!
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hi.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Has it really been five years?
Leslie Knope,It has.
Leslie Knope,You look amazing.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thank you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This place hasn't changed a bit.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Still loveable, but grimy."
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, there."
Ben Wyatt,I'm Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,I'm assistant city manager
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hi, Dan."
Ben Wyatt,Ben.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's not important.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It won't come up again.
Leslie Knope,This is Ann.
Leslie Knope,She is my best friend.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Now.
Leslie Knope,"And she's a nurse, and she works at a hospital."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Nice to meet you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm sorry.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"It's just, nursing... You must be so tired and sad."
Leslie Knope,It's really nice outside.
Leslie Knope,Shall we speak in my courtyard?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you so much for stopping by."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was passing through Pawnee anyway.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do a lot of charity work here.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,There's only so much you can do.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Look at that.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Let me get a closer look.
Leslie Knope,So let's talk about Lafayette Park.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Oh, yes."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm only trying to protect our children.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you."
Leslie Knope,"When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone."
Leslie Knope,That's what makes them so great.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You know what's really great?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,A private park that's not for everyone.
Leslie Knope,Wowsers.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What do you care?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's just a crappy little park.
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,And that someone was this woman.
Leslie Knope,You can take it if you want.
Leslie Knope,I have many copies and the negatives.
Leslie Knope,And I have a JPEG.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence stays up.
Leslie Knope,"Lindsay, if we"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Sweetie, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, Pawnee is and always will be a dirty, little nightmare from which you will never wake up."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,But it was good seeing you.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I'm not asleep.
Leslie Knope,I'm awake.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you."
Leslie Knope,That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.
Leslie Knope,What did I say instead?
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,This is where they have their public forums?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's not that great."
Tom Haverford,They had a valet.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Leslie Knope,But their people are not inherently better than our people.
Leslie Knope,"The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income."
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,Factoid alert.
Leslie Knope,Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee was established in May of 1817.
Leslie Knope,"And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hello, Pawnee."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Welcome to our public forum.
Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Thomas Montgomery Haverford."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, nice outfit."
Leslie Knope,"What, did you just come from the stables?"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yes.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was just at the stables.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You look like you've been working hard.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You have a million flyaways right now.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Would you like to borrow a mirror or a selfhelp book?
Leslie Knope,I would not.
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay."
Leslie Knope,Pun intended.
Leslie Knope,"You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Well, you don't have my job because you knew you couldn't handle it."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The forum is beginning.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"We've got a little bit of Eagleton business, and then I'll introduce you."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Tom Haverford,Look how pretty the people are.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ron."
April Ludgate,How's the street parking at your house?
Ron Swanson,What?
April Ludgate,"Can you handle, like, 20 cars or a double decker party bus?"
Ron Swanson,There is no street parking at my house.
April Ludgate,My house is not even on a street.
April Ludgate,"Do you have space for, like, a huge circus tent?"
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ron."
Ann Perkins,Have you seen
Ann Perkins,What the hell?
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ron Swanson,"Well, looks like there won't be any balloons for the birthday boy."
Ann Perkins,These were for a sick child at the hospital.
Ron Swanson,"My office, now."
Ann Perkins,I don't work for you.
Ron Swanson,Don't care.
Tom Haverford,"Decisions, decisions."
Tom Haverford,"I think I'm gonna go with the porcini mushrooms and boursin, s'il vous plait."
Leslie Knope,that the EagletonPawnee fence does a lot more harm than it does good.
Bertram Rolands,Hello.
Bertram Rolands,"I'm Bertram Rolands, a citizen of Eagleton."
Bertram Rolands,"With all due respect, Ms. Knope, can't you just clean up your side of the park, put some new equipment there?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now."
Christine Porter,Hello.
Christine Porter,I'm Christine Porter.
Christine Porter,I want to respectfully say that I'm in favor of the fence.
Christine Porter,I see it as a kind of punishment for Pawnee that might inspire your town to clean up its act.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett."
Leslie Knope,"Joey, wave to the audience."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence."
Joey Plunkett,I can wave with this arm.
Leslie Knope,"No, you can't."
Leslie Knope,Both your arms are broken.
Extra,"All due respect, I recognize that boy."
Extra,He was caught selling fireworks to Eagleton kids.
Leslie Knope,"Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town."
Leslie Knope,You cannot be sure that he is the one.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This is a perfect example of how we're going to help you.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Here's to you, Joey, and your mother and to every Pawnee citizen who might have a bright future if they fundamentally change everything about themselves."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thanks to Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I'm not done.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Isn't she trying her hardest?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,So cute and so good.
Ron Swanson,I'm only gonna ask you this once.
Ron Swanson,What is going on with my birthday?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,"Ron, it's your birthday."
Ann Perkins,Happy Birthday.
Ron Swanson,Shut your damn mouth.
Ann Perkins,This is a fun conversation.
Ron Swanson,Just tell me what Leslie is planning.
Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I don't know."
Ann Perkins,I haven't heard anything.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you tell me what she did for your last birthday?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, that was intense."
Ann Perkins,She totally surprised me.
Ann Perkins,"She kidnapped me from work, and then she took me to that place, Senor Vega's, you know, where the mariachi band comes out."
Ann Perkins,"They put a big sombrero on you, and then everybody sings ""Happy Birthday""?"
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Ann Perkins,"And then we went back to my house, and she invited basically everyone I knew, and she had this great guy doing face painting, and I had my face painted like a fairy tiger."
Ron Swanson,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,"Also, she did it, like, a week before my birthday, which is genius, 'cause I had no idea it was coming."
Ann Perkins,And then there was a bouncy castle.
Ann Perkins,Did you know they made those for adults?
Ron Swanson,Mmmhmm.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll change it up this time.
Tom Haverford,Can I try the andouille sausage?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, let's go."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,No.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, not you too."
Ben Wyatt,It's gross.
Ben Wyatt,I don't like it.
Ben Wyatt,It's disgusting.
Tom Haverford,Did you guys get your public forum gift bag?
Tom Haverford,There's an iPod touch in here.
Leslie Knope,"Man, she used to not be like this."
Leslie Knope,Eagleton really changed her.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, what exactly happened between the two of you, anyway? "
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job."
Tom Haverford, And you said no? Are you insane? 
Leslie Knope,"I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live."
Leslie Knope," And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared."
Ben Wyatt, Wow.
Tom Haverford, Verbena-scented soy candles! 
Chris Traeger,"You want me to do what, now?"
Ron Swanson,"Send Leslie somewhere on an assignment, a conference or something, and make her take April and freeze their bank accounts."
Chris Traeger, I don't understand.
Chris Traeger, Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory?
Ron Swanson,"No, it has nothing to do with her work."
Ron Swanson, I don't want to get into it.
Chris Traeger," Ron, look, this is me, okay? You know you can talk to me about anything."
Ron Swanson," Well, it's my birthday on Friday."
Chris Traeger, Hey! Happy Birthday.
Ron Swanson, I'm ending this right now.
Ron Swanson, I'm just gonna leave early and go home.
Ron Swanson, Unless That's exactly what she wants me to do.
Leslie Knope," All right, everybody just grab a bag and open it up and then try to find some dirty stuff in there."
Ben Wyatt, What are you doing? 
Leslie Knope,Eagleton treats us like garbage.
Leslie Knope, We're gonna treat them like garbage.
Leslie Knope," We're gonna take these bags of trash, and we're gonna throw it over to their side of the park."
Leslie Knope, And then we're just gonna let the stink and the raccoons run wild.
Ben Wyatt," Well, isn't that just playing right into what they think of you? "
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, What am I thinking? Let's just stop this.
Leslie Knope, Put everything back in the truck.
Leslie Knope, Let's back it up.
Andy Dwyer," No, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer," Leslie, you promised we could throw garbage everywhere."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay, Wow.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay," I didn't expect to see the whole Parks Department here, although it is, sadly, one of the nicest spots in town."
Leslie Knope," I am so sick of this, Lindsay."
Tom Haverford," Wait, Leslie."
Tom Haverford, I've got this.
Tom Haverford," You listen to me, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."
Tom Haverford," Why don't you take your fancy dog, get in your Escalade, and if you have any job openings, maybe you should let me know about 'em."
Ben Wyatt," Come on, man."
Tom Haverford," No! I'm sick of being treated like I'm not willing to relocate to Eagleton, because I am! So here's what you could do, lady."
Tom Haverford, Take this resume and shove it into your human resources slot.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, yeah! Shove it there!"
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope," You might have a fancy car and a mahogany purse, or whatever rich people have, but I remember something that you're trying to forget."
Leslie Knope, You're a Pawnee girl.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay," No, Leslie, I'm not."
Leslie Knope," Well, then why do you come here at dinnertime and get takeout from the legendary J.J's Diner?"
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's not for me.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay, These waffles make great dog laxatives.
Leslie Knope, Don't you dare feed that waffle to that dog to get it to poop.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay, Sambuca need to make? There you go.
Ben Wyatt, Leslie.
Leslie Knope, How dare you? No!
Andy Dwyer,"Get her, Leslie!"
Andy Dwyer,Garbage fight!
Tom Haverford,Ugh!   
Leslie Knope,I want her arrested for attempted murder.
Chief Trumple,"For God's sake Knope, get a grip."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Thank God you're here, I want her arrested, she attacked me and then she hurled my Kate Spade headband somewhere."
Chief Trumple,"I think my Eagleton colleagues would agree that we don't want to make a federal case out of this, so I suggest you both apologize to each never and we can pretend this never happened."
Leslie Knope,I will never apologize to her.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Nor I her.
Leslie Knope,Nor I her.
Leslie Knope,I doth proclaim to be a stupid fart face.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Nice retort, did G.B. Shaw write that for you?"
Leslie Knope,Did G.B. Shaw write your stupid fart face?
Chief Trumple,"Ladies, if you don't apologize, we're going to have to toss the both of you in jail, so just swallow your pride say you're sorry."
Extra,We hope you enjoy your evening here at the Eagleton holding cell.
Extra,"May I offer you anything, herbal tea, Greek yogurt?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,Morning Ron.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, dude, you forgot to put a shirt, I do it all the time, it's fine."
Ron Swanson,I slept here.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet.
Andy Dwyer,"So a little birdie told me it's your birthday coming up, how about a free birthday shoe shine?"
Ron Swanson,What did this little birdie tell you is going to happen for my birthday?
Andy Dwyer,"Nice try Ron, you're not going to get anything out of me."
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, please."
Andy Dwyer,"Look Ron, I love you like a father who's not that much older than me, like a young uncle, or like you're my camp counselor, but we hang out and it's not weird."
Andy Dwyer,"Or actually here's what it is, you're my lacrosse coach--"
Ron Swanson,"I get it, I get it, what's the point?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, coach, Leslie swore me to secrecy, so I can't say anything, I owe her so much I can't ruin it for her."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I respect that, see you later."
Andy Dwyer,"Not if I see you first, uncle Ron, and I probably will because Leslie assigned me to the kidnap squad."
Ann Perkins,Hey jail bird.
Leslie Knope,Beautiful Ann.
Leslie Knope,Thank you for coming to get me.
Ann Perkins,"Oh my god, are you kidding, are you okay."
Leslie Knope,"It was a rough night, but I survived."
Leslie Knope,Scone? They only have maple walnut.
Ann Perkins,"Why did you get arrested, what did you do?"
Leslie Knope,The only thing I'm guilty of is loving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"And punching Lindsay in the face, and shoving a coffee filter down her pants."
Leslie Knope,"But in my defense, I believe that assault should be illegal if the person is a jerk."
Ann Perkins,Why are you letting her get to you like this
Leslie Knope,Because she's a stupid jerk.
Leslie Knope,because we were best friends and then she sold out everything that we believed in.
Leslie Knope,"and the worst part, to her our friendship it's like it never happened."
Ann Perkins,"Well first of all, this color looks amazing on you."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Second of all, this whole fence thing, she's obviously just trying to get a rise out of you."
Ann Perkins,"Third of all, she knows she only got the job because you turned it down which must drive her nuts."
Ann Perkins,"But most importantly, you say the word, and I will beat her senseless with a baseball bat."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, oh my god, okay we have a lot of work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, put these scones in your bra, let's go."
Ann Perkins,Can we just stop off at the lobby because the prison gift bags are amazing.
Andy Dwyer,Hey batter batter batter batter
Andy Dwyer,Crazy base hit.
April Ludgate,Dude stop rooting for the other team.
Andy Dwyer,You're just mad because they are lighting you up.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What's going on here?
Leslie Knope,"Hey Lindsay, introducing the Pawnee wiffle ball league."
Leslie Knope,It's an idea that I came up with after my best friend Ann over there said she wanted to bash your head in with a baseball bat.
Leslie Knope,"and I want to thank you for the fence, there's no way we could afford that high quality wood."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"What if someone hits a homerun, how will you get the ball back?"
Leslie Knope,One of the many Eagleton kids who signed up will just pop over and grab it.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing tonight?
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Why?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, I thought maybe you could bust out your old Jazz sweatshirt and you and I could go to Sullivan's for a beer."
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do still have that sweatshirt.
Leslie Knope,I know you do.
Andy Dwyer,Foul ball.
Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You did all of this in a day?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I work with some really great people."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you hear the news?"
Leslie Knope,Ben and chris want us to go into conference room C for a meeting.
Ron Swanson,Let's get this over with.
Leslie Knope,"Happy birthday, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Ann said you had a big party, sombreros, karaoke."
Leslie Knope,I did that for Ann.
Leslie Knope,why would I throw Ron Swanson an Ann Perkins party?
Ron Swanson,What about that giant list of things April was doing?
Leslie Knope,That was just a list of ways to mess with you.
Leslie Knope,She do them all?
Ron Swanson,She did indeed.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have rented Bridge on the River Kwai and the Dirty Dozen."
Leslie Knope,Artie from security is outside the door so no one will bother you.
Leslie Knope,and a cab will be here whenever you're ready to take you home.
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Do you remember what you said to me five years ago when Eagleton offered me that job and I asked you for advice?
Ron Swanson,"Do whatever the hell you want, what do I care?"
Leslie Knope,"Right, but after, when I pressed you?"
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Ron Swanson,"I believe I said that I thought we worked well together, and that I might disagree with your philosophy but I respected you."
Ron Swanson,"and I said that you'll get  a lot of job offers in your life, but you only have one hometown."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's how I remember it."
Leslie Knope,"This, by the way, is a onetime only situation."
Leslie Knope,"Next year, your birthday party is going to be a rager."

Ron Swanson,"So, who broke it?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm not mad, I just want to know"
Leslie Knope,"I did, I broke"
Ron Swanson,"No, no you didn't."
Ron Swanson,Tom?
Tom Haverford,Don't look at me.
Tom Haverford,Look at Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"What, I didn't break it."
Tom Haverford,"Huh, that's weird, how'd you even know it was broken?"
Ben Wyatt,"because it's sitting right in front of us, and it's broken."
Tom Haverford,Suspicious.
Ben Wyatt,No it's not.
Jerry Gergich,"If it matters, probably not, April was the last one to use it."
April Ludgate,"Liar, I don't even drink that crap."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh really, then what were you doing by the coffee cart earlier."
April Ludgate,"I use the wooden stirs to push my cuticles back, everyone knows that Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay, let's not fight, I broke it, let me pay for it Ron."
Ron Swanson,"No, who broke it?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, Donna's been awfully quiet."
Donna Meagle,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah really?
Ron Swanson,I broke it.
Ron Swanson,It burned my hand so I punched it.
Ron Swanson,I predict ten minutes from now they'll be at each other's throats with war paint on their faces and a pig head on a stick.
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson,It was getting a little chummy around here.
Tom Haverford,I need you guys to come to the Snakehole Lounge tonight to help me with something.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, no, tonight's not good."
Ron Swanson,No can do.
Donna Meagle,I'm on a cleanse.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,This is important.
Tom Haverford,"I'm launching my new high end, Kahlua style liqueur, Snake Juice."
April Ludgate,Sounds like you took a snake and twisted it like a rag until its blood and guts came out.
Leslie Knope,What does Kahlua style mean?
Tom Haverford,"I mix a bunch of alcohol together, I add some sugar and coffee and some other junk, and it kind of tastes like Kahlua."
Donna Meagle,I can only drink warm tap water with cayenne pepper.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Then don't drink it.
Tom Haverford,"Just get other people to drink it, okay?"
Tom Haverford,Meeting in one hour.
Tom Haverford,"If you don't make it, you're on my Donezo list."
Ben Wyatt,"What's a ""Donezo list""?"
Tom Haverford,It means you and I are donezo.
Tom Haverford,"Hanging out, getting food together, donezo."
Tom Haverford,You want to come over to my house and play video games?
Tom Haverford,Donezo.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Tom, you want to come play PuttPutt with me?"
Tom Haverford,"No, we're donezo."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, we got to make that meeting."
Leslie Knope,"I'm so glad we found this time to talk ,it feels like it's been forever."
Ann Perkins,"I know, I've been so busy at the hospital, long hours, overnight shifts, getting sick of it."
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's start with the personal stuff."
Leslie Knope,How's Jessie?
Ann Perkins,Who?
Leslie Knope,The photographer guy.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,We broke up.
Ann Perkins,I didn't tell you that?
Leslie Knope,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,I liked him.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I did, too."
Ann Perkins,I just I couldn't deal with his face.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I could get that book back that I loaned him?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, I'm technically out of the country."
Ann Perkins,So I would have to call him from a weird number.
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Never mind.
Ann Perkins,"But I'm seeing this new guy, Mattias."
Ann Perkins,You would love him.
Ann Perkins,He's a triple Pisces.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, looks like someone's gonna be late for her meeting."
Leslie Knope,Race you.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Isn't that a little childish?
Leslie Knope,"Bye, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, got to go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, move!"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Howser, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Nice to see you as always.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Tom Haverford,Welcome to Guerilla Marketing 101.
Tom Haverford,What is Guerilla Marketing?
Tom Haverford,"A few ordinary schmoes, no offense, have a casual conversation next to some guy about how great Snake Juice is."
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know that guy orders a whole bottle of Snake Juice, and he has no idea why."
Tom Haverford,"April, you will be playing a boring beer drinker named Jennifer."
Tom Haverford,"Andy, you are also a boring beer drinker named Michael."
Tom Haverford,"Ron is going to play our exciting Snake Juice drinker, A.K.A. Brian Thunder."
Donna Meagle,You want us to memorize this whole script?
Tom Haverford,"Ideally, but if you want to wing it,"
Tom Haverford,"Your talking points are highend, VIP, lifestyle."
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's run through it once."
Tom Haverford,And action!
Jerry Gergich,The weather has been so weird lately.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, let me buy you all a drink."
April Ludgate,I'll take something basic like a beer.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I'm pretty boring."
Andy Dwyer,"So I'll take a beer, too."
Ron Swanson,Not me.
Ron Swanson,I want this night to get Krazzy.
Tom Haverford,Carazy.
Tom Haverford,Like crazy.
Ron Swanson,I want this night to get crazy.
Ron Swanson,Get me a shot of Snake Juice.
Ron Swanson,I hear it has a dope aftertaste.
Tom Haverford,"All right, that's gonna be a cut."
Tom Haverford,"Um Ron, you got to say it like you mean it."
Ron Swanson,I won't publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively and I really believe in it.
Ron Swanson,"My only official recommendations are U.S. Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton Salt, and the C.R Laurence Fein two inch, axe style scraper oscillating knife blade."
Chris Traeger,We need to find a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Chris Traeger,Dennis Cooper was fired today.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Chris Traeger,"Short answer, he went bananas."
Chris Traeger,"Long answer, his wife, Jan, had an affair, gave him a venereal disease, and so he put signs about her all through City Hall."
Chris Traeger,I'm sure you've seen them.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Chris Traeger,"""Jan Cooper will give you Chlamydia."""
Chris Traeger,"""Brought to you by the Pawnee Health Department."
Chris Traeger,"""Chlamydia affects nearly 100% of Jan Coopers."""
Chris Traeger,"""The Department of Health congratulates Jan Cooper."""
Chris Traeger,"""Miss Chlamydia."""
Chris Traeger,"""Jan, I love you."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please come back."""
Chris Traeger,"""I realize that I'm not blameless here."""
Chris Traeger,"""Please."""
Chris Traeger,Brought to you by the Health Department.
Chris Traeger,"""Reelect Jan Cooper."""
Chris Traeger,"""Mayor of Whoreville."""
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I want you to help us choose a replacement."
Chris Traeger,Parks and Health work closely together on outdoor programs and exercise initiatives.
Leslie Knope,Ann should do it.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins?
Ann Perkins,"Pawnee is looking for a new PR Director for the Health Department, and I submitted your name."
Ann Perkins,You have an interview tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.
Ann Perkins,"9 a.m., wow."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I know."
Leslie Knope,I couldn't get it earlier.
Ann Perkins,I'm Grateful.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,You can thank me later.
Leslie Knope,"But first, you need to go over your homework."
Leslie Knope,These are all the health initiatives the city has ever undertaken since the 1960s.
Leslie Knope,So you need to partially memorize that.
Leslie Knope,"And it's gonna be a long night, so I got you some energy drinks and some chocolate covered espresso beans and the book Freedom by Jonathan Franzen."
Ann Perkins,Why am I reading this?
Leslie Knope,"Because I'm almost done with it, Ann."
Leslie Knope,And I want to talk to you about Patty.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, deep breath."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I've been a nurse for over 10 years.
Ann Perkins,It's not something you just quit.
Leslie Knope,I understand.
Leslie Knope,"I just think with this new job, you could make a difference."
Leslie Knope,Make real change happen.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we'd be working in the same building."
Leslie Knope,No more lightning round catchup sessions.
Ann Perkins,It would be nice to have an office.
Leslie Knope,This is your destiny Ann.
Leslie Knope,You don't want to waste away at Pawnee St. Joseph's medical center and turn into her.
Extra,Ow.
Extra,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,"And let's be honest, it would be nice to not have to pull strange things out of people's butts every night."
Ann Perkins,You've mentioned that before.
Ann Perkins,That doesn't happen that often.
Leslie Knope,It happened once.
Ann Perkins,Just once.
Leslie Knope,That already is too many times.
April Ludgate,I hate talking to people about things.
April Ludgate,This is a nightmare.
April Ludgate,I'm grouchy.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, we have to support Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I don't want to end up on that donezo list.
Andy Dwyer,Think about it as roleplaying.
Andy Dwyer,That makes it sexy.
April Ludgate,That could be fun.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Can I use a weird voice and try to freak people out?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Then next time you see me, I'll be a stranger."
Extra,"Hey, Tommy, I'm really hoping this booze of yours is going to sell because I am not going to take a loss on this."
Tom Haverford,Nothing this delicious will fail.
Extra,"Check back with me in  a couple hours, I'll let you know how it's going."
Leslie Knope,Snake Juice!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Here?
Leslie Knope,"High end, VIP, exclusive."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how's it going?"
Tom Haverford,I think it's going okay.
Tom Haverford,"People better buy this stuff, or else I'm gonna be screwed."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be fine.
Leslie Knope,People will definitely buy it.
Jean-Ralphio,"Uhoh, uhoh."
Jean-Ralphio,"""K"" to the ""N"" to the ""OPE,"" she's the dopest little shorty in all Pawnee, Indiana."
Tom Haverford,"Why didn't you just stop at ""Pawnee""?"
Jean-Ralphio,"Leslie Knope, seriously, you get sexier every day."
Jean-Ralphio,And that is not a line.
Jean-Ralphio,That is for real.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, JeanRalphio."
Leslie Knope,So you're helping Tom.
Jean-Ralphio,"Absolutely, and it's time to get that paper."
Tom Haverford,Get get get get get get that paper.
Jean-Ralphio,Get get get get get get that paper.
Jean-Ralphio,"Snake juice sales are going to be off the chorts, why, because that shiz is straight up deloicious."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I know tonight's gonna be a big success, and I wish I could stay."
Leslie Knope,"I really do, but I have to go help Ann."
Leslie Knope,She's gonna be up all night cramming for a big job interview.
Tom Haverford,"She might be up all night, but I think someone else is gonna be doing the cramming."
Jean-Ralphio,Uhoh!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy to see you.
Leslie Knope,And I'm seeing you here.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm surprised."
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe you'd be home preparing for tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, there was way too much stuff for me to read tonight, anyway."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, it was a ridiculous amount of stuff that you gave me."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,But you are going in for the interview tomorrow?
Ann Perkins,I think so.
The Douche,Uhoh.
The Douche,"Is there enough room for some ""manaise"" in this lady sandwich?"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is my friend Howard Tuttleman."
The Douche,"Oh, please."
The Douche,"Call me ""The Douche."""
The Douche,"You probably know me from my morning radio show on 93.7, ""Crazy Ira and The Douche."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I had met you before."
Leslie Knope,I actually was on your show once--
The Douche,Wait!
The Douche,Were you on the show where we had that stripper do math?
The Douche,"Classic, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, strange person who I have never met before."
Andy Dwyer,Who are you?
April Ludgate,I'm Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,I'm a very rich widow with a terrible secret.
Andy Dwyer,Who are you?
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,I was the best damn agent they had until I was framed for a crime I didn't commit.
Andy Dwyer,Stealing the President's rubies.
Andy Dwyer,Now I work alone.
April Ludgate,Lovely to meet you.
Andy Dwyer,"I got to admit, I thought your costume would maybe be a little bit sluttier."
April Ludgate,How dare you?
Andy Dwyer,Nice.
Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Jean-Ralphio,Swan song.
Jean-Ralphio,How you living?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Why aren't you holding a Snake Juice?
Ron Swanson,I'm more of a whiskey man.
Jean-Ralphio,"RonRon, come here."
Jean-Ralphio,Come here for a bit.
Jean-Ralphio,You're good right there.
Jean-Ralphio,"Listen, you got to jump on the Tommy Town Express."
Jean-Ralphio,This guy has some of the best investment ideas I've ever heard in my life.
Tom Haverford,Make a baby tuxedo clothing line.
Tom Haverford,A department store with a guest list.
Tom Haverford,White fur ear muffs for men.

Tom Haverford,Contact lenses that display text messages.
Tom Haverford,Invent a phone that smells good.
Tom Haverford,Own a night club called Eclipse that's only open for one hour two times a year.
Tom Haverford,"Cover charge, 5,000 dollars."
Tom Haverford,I can keep going.
Tom Haverford,"How about this, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Try Snake Juice.
Tom Haverford,"If you like it, you got to talk it up all night."
Tom Haverford,"If you don't, I'll shave JeanRalphio's head."
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I'd like to see that."
Ron Swanson,Hit me.
Jean-Ralphio,A lot riding on this.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, if that isn't delicious."
Jean-Ralphio,"""R"" to the ""O"" to the ""N"" I say Swanson's got swagger the size of a Big Ben clock"
Tom Haverford,"Dude, you got to end it on the rhyme."
Jean-Ralphio,I know what I have to do.
Tom Haverford,"You had it at ""Ben."""
Jean-Ralphio,I know.
Jean-Ralphio,I got it.
April Ludgate,You think I haven't been around the world?
April Ludgate,"I've been everywhere, darling."
April Ludgate,I'm a very wealthy woman.
April Ludgate,"My husband's kept me in the finest clothes from Bergdorf Goodman, you see."
Andy Dwyer,Freeze!
Andy Dwyer,FBI!
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,Leave me alone!
Andy Dwyer,Hands in the air!
April Ludgate,I didn't kill anybody!
April Ludgate,And I didn't burn down the mill either.
April Ludgate,My sister did.
April Ludgate,But now she's been eaten by wolves!
Andy Dwyer,Nothing to see here.
Leslie Knope,So how did you two meet?
Ann Perkins,We met at the supermarket.
The Douche,I used my classic pickup line.
The Douche,"""If you're looking for douches, they're in Aisle Me."""
Leslie Knope,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey, by the way, I don't think I can get that book back from what's his name."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's okay."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I should've known better than to loan something to one of your boyfriends."
Leslie Knope,They come and go so fast.
Ann Perkins,What are you saying exactly?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, let's be honest."
Leslie Knope,How long is it gonna last with this guy?
The Douche,Sitting right here.
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"He's dumb, but he's fun."
The Douche,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, that's the whole point of dating around is you get to try on a bunch of different hats."
Leslie Knope,"Well, this hat is an idiot."
The Douche,Classic.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, are you mad that I came here?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I'm not-- Are you-- You seem mad at me.
Ann Perkins,"No, I'm not-- I'm not mad at you."
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad at you.
Ann Perkins,I'm not mad at all.
Leslie Knope,Neither am I.
Ann Perkins,No.
The Douche,Looks like you two need to kiss and make up.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"In general, I try never to speak with people, but I have been drinking this Snake Juice thing, and it's damn good."
Ron Swanson,You should buy it.
Extra,"Yeah, okay."
Extra,"Thanks, man."
Ron Swanson,"Son, you should know that my recommendation is essentially a guarantee."
Ron Swanson,"Drink this, now."
Tom Haverford,Traegermeister!
Tom Haverford,You made it.
Chris Traeger,"Yeah, I got your email."
Chris Traeger,We need to talk.
Tom Haverford,"First off, though, try a little Snake Juice."
Tom Haverford,"It's 140 proof, which means it's 70% alcohol."
Tom Haverford,But don't worry.
Tom Haverford,There's plenty of caffeine in it to keep you awake.
Chris Traeger,I believe an ounce of that would literally kill me.
Chris Traeger,You emailed everyone at City Hall and told them to come to a club that you own to buy alcohol that you invented.
Chris Traeger,Government employees can't use their power to enhance their personal wealth.
Tom Haverford,"I totally get your point, Chris."
Tom Haverford,It won't happen again.
Chris Traeger,I just don't see any way around it.
Chris Traeger,You're gonna have to sell your shares in the Snakehole.
Tom Haverford,No!
Jean-Ralphio,"TPain, this guy bothering you?"
Tom Haverford,This is my boss.
Jean-Ralphio,"Okay, yeah."
Jean-Ralphio,You want me to write a rap about your name?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Jean-Ralphio,"""B"" to the ""O"" to the double ""S,"" do what he say, and you'll be successful "
Ann Perkins,"No offense, but maybe you think I'm going too fast 'cause you're going too slow with Ben."
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I'm going slow because I might lose my job."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, no offense, but maybe that's a little bit of an excuse for not acting on your feelings."
Leslie Knope,"No offense, but I don't remember you having a nursing degree in feelings."
Ann Perkins,Offense!
Ann Perkins,That's rude.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go dance.
Ann Perkins,"Douche, you're up."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, are you okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I heard yelling.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm very angry, and I'm really drunk."
Leslie Knope,Do you want to dance with me?
Leslie Knope,"Go get me another ""Snork Juice."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's maybe not the best idea for you."
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio!
Jean-Ralphio,"Yes, I'm here."
Leslie Knope,Dance up on me.
Jean-Ralphio,"Yes, yes, yes."
Andy Dwyer,How's it going with her?
Ben Wyatt,"Well nothing's going at all really, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,"I feel like I just did something wrong, she just doesn't seem to want to talk with me."
Andy Dwyer,"You should try roleplay, that's what me and April do."
Ben Wyatt,That explains the outfit.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah you gotta dream up some weird scenario like you're her boss and sex is forbidden because she works for you.
Ben Wyatt,That is our actual situation.
Andy Dwyer,And she's addicted to spanking.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, thanks, we got it, we're good."
Leslie Knope,"If you're worried about working with Chris, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"He's fine with it, he said it wouldn't be weird."
Ann Perkins,You talked to Chris before you talked to me?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"This is my first fight with Ann, and it's a doozy."
Leslie Knope,But I believe that honest discussions between friends can lead to deeper intimacy.
Leslie Knope,"This is a watershed moment in our relationship, and it's important that we fight clean."
Leslie Knope,All I need to do is focus and stay calm.
Leslie Knope,"You're stupid, and you're drunk and you're stupid."
Ann Perkins,I don't understand how this is my fault.
Leslie Knope,It's not Everything isn't your fault all the time.
Leslie Knope,Don't always make everything your fault.
Ann Perkins,Good!
Ann Perkins,It's not all my fault.
Ann Perkins,I'm not the stupid jerk.
Ann Perkins,I'm not the one who's being a stupid jerk right now.
Leslie Knope,I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,You know I didn't mean it like that.
Leslie Knope,"I just meant you were being stupid, and you were acting like a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm sorry that I thought about you for the job, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"But sometimes if I don't push you in the right direction, you end up standing still."
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to do you a favor.
Ann Perkins,"Enough with your favors, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we shouldn't work together, then."
Ann Perkins,Maybe we shouldn't.
Chris Traeger,"Every time I cleanse, I can literally feel the toxins leaving my body."
Donna Meagle,I know!
Donna Meagle,I feel so much healthier.
Donna Meagle,I've still got a full week to go before the broth stage.
Chris Traeger,Prebroth is an amazing stage.
Chris Traeger,It's when you're most alert.
Donna Meagle,Good.
Donna Meagle,Someone needs to be alert tonight.
Donna Meagle,This Snake Juice is basically rat poison.
Donna Meagle,Everybody's wasted.
Leslie Knope,You don't even know one thing.
Leslie Knope,I didn't even say one thing.
Leslie Knope,"And then she asked me the whole thing, and I didn't even do it once."
Tom Haverford,"I'm like an elephant, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"If I walk into a room, it's like, okay, he's in there."
Ben Wyatt,Bababooey.
Ann Perkins,"I'm not gonna tell, that that bitch over there, I don't need to brag"
Andy Dwyer,Turn this music down.
Andy Dwyer,Farts and poop and love and stuff Macaroni salad
Ron Swanson, Is this everybody?
Donna Meagle,Ann took a cab.
Donna Meagle,Tom's in the trunk.
Donna Meagle,Jerry's on the roof.
Donna Meagle,"All right, where to first?"
Leslie Knope,Your mother's butt.
Tom Haverford,I'm so alone.
Donna Meagle,"If even one of you thinks about dryheaving in my car, you're all walking home."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,I'm here.
Ben Wyatt,We have to go hire a new PR Director for the Health Department.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm so hung over.
Leslie Knope,I've never been this hung over.
Ben Wyatt,I feel great.
Ben Wyatt,I ran five k this morning.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I threw up in the shower."
Ron Swanson,"Top of the morning, everyone."
Ron Swanson,I brought some burgers and fries.
Ron Swanson,Eat up.
Ron Swanson,The protein soaks up the sugar.
Ron Swanson,"First, you take the cow to the killing floor"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am out of questions."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,We will let you know.
Ben Wyatt,"Then our heads will explode, and we will die."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe that fight I had with Ann.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm sure you guys can work it out."
Leslie Knope,"I owe her, like, a million apologies."
Leslie Knope,"I think I owe you one, too."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,For what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm sad."
April Ludgate,"Say, thanks, chum."
April Ludgate,I'll get those papers delivered for you.
Jerry Gergich,Whatever.
April Ludgate,Post haste.
Kyle,"The doctor says it's probably not serious, but it might be."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Kyle, please stop talking."
April Ludgate,"Why, isn't it Bert Macklin?"
April Ludgate,"What are you doing here, and who is this sorry charlie?"
April Ludgate,I'm Janet Snakehole.
April Ludgate,"I demand answers, and I want them now."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, please."
Andy Dwyer,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, but Bert Macklin died last night after the tenth shot of Snake Juice."
April Ludgate,"Okay, sorry."
Andy Dwyer,Miss Snakehole.
Andy Dwyer,You think I'd let you get away that easily?
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin may be dead, but I'm his brother Kip Hackman."
Kyle,Why wouldn't you have his same last name?
Andy Dwyer,"Shut up, Kyle."
Andy Dwyer,I know you boosted those paintings.
April Ludgate,"Maybe it was me, but I'll never tell you where they are."
April Ludgate,And you'll never have my body either.
Jean-Ralphio,"T, you don't have to worry about a thing, because I'm gonna keep those shares real tight for you, real nice and cozy like."
Donna Meagle,"Sorry to hear the news, Tom."
Donna Meagle,We're gonna miss you around the club.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you own shares, too."
Tom Haverford,Why didn't Chris make you sell?
Donna Meagle,'Cause Chris doesn't know.
Donna Meagle,You know what?
Donna Meagle,Snitches get stitches.
Jean-Ralphio,"Donna, come on."
Donna Meagle,Don't.
Tom Haverford,I'm a natural moneymaker.
Tom Haverford,I got into government for the connections.
Tom Haverford,This was supposed to be a thing that led to the other thing.
Tom Haverford,It's like when Vin did Boiler Room.
Tom Haverford,That's what led to him being xXx and doing Furious.
Jean-Ralphio,And Furious.
Jean-Ralphio,"Yeah, I know."
Jean-Ralphio,"Listen, I don't like all this negativity, man."
Jean-Ralphio,"Why don't you turn that ""frizzown"" ""upsidedizzity."""
Jean-Ralphio,Huh?
Tom Haverford,"This sucks, man."
Ben Wyatt,You're wearing snow pants.
Ann Perkins,"I got home last night, and I thought I might go sledding."
Ben Wyatt,Can I come in?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, if you're quiet."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie doesn't know I'm here."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,So high school.
Ann Perkins,I can't believe that Leslie and I got drunk in a bar and fought about boys.
Ann Perkins, We're so much better than that.
Ann Perkins, I just keep having flashes of things that we said to each other.
Ann Perkins, And she's so important to me.
Ann Perkins, I feel like such a dick.
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, I don't know you that well, but you're clearly very important to Leslie"
Ben Wyatt,and that must mean you're a pretty great person.
Ben Wyatt, I know she feels awful.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, technically, we all do."
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Ann Perkins," What the hell is in Snake Juice, Demerol?"
Ben Wyatt, All I know is Leslie's always talking about how lucky she is to have you as a friend.
Ben Wyatt, And I just wanted you to know that.
Ann Perkins, You're nice.
Ann Perkins, I can see why she likes you.
Ben Wyatt, When did she say... Likes me?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins, This is so high school.
Ann Perkins," Just rent a limo, ask her to the prom."
Ann Perkins, I'm sure she'll say yes.
Ben Wyatt, All right.
Ben Wyatt, Thanks.
Ron Swanson, So let me get this straight.
Ron Swanson," Tom tries to get off the government teat, and we punish him."
Ron Swanson, That doesn't make any sense to me.
Chris Traeger, I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger, Rules are rules.
Chris Traeger, I wish there was something we could do.
Chris Traeger," Ben, is there something we can do? Damn it."
Chris Traeger, Ben's not here.
Ron Swanson, Tom's not scamming anyone.
Ron Swanson, He's not savvy enough to manipulate the system like that.
Ron Swanson, He's just a kid chasing a goofy dream.
Chris Traeger, I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger, My hands are tied.
Extra, Jan Cooper was a terrible wife.
Extra, I just want everybody to know that.
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope, But we can't give you your job back.
Extra, You sound just like her.
Ben Wyatt, That was unpleasant.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," All right, who's next? You came."
Ann Perkins," Yeah, I had some encouragement."
Ben Wyatt, Your sweater's on inside out.
Ann Perkins, And backwards.
Ann Perkins, It's been a tough morning.
Ann Perkins, Lots of regret and shame.
Ann Perkins, That should be the official slogan for Snake Juice.
Leslie Knope," Well, this committee would like to ask if you are the kind of candidate who could forgive someone after they've behaved like a complete jackass?"
Ann Perkins," This candidate could, especially because this candidate also behaved like a total jackass."
Leslie Knope," Please, don't worry about it."
Leslie Knope, The committee totally understands.
Ann Perkins," Also, I can talk about my qualifications for this position."
Ann Perkins," But first, I am gonna go throw up in a wastebasket."
Leslie Knope, Would you mind if I joined you?
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Leslie Knope, Shall we? Ann came in the next day and had a second interview with Chris.
Chris Traeger, Great.
Leslie Knope," She nailed it, of course."
Leslie Knope, But she doesn't want to totally leave her job.
Leslie Knope, So they struck up a deal.
Leslie Knope," She works at City Hall part-time, and two days a week, she still gets to be the greatest nurse in the world."
Leslie Knope, Win-win.
Leslie Knope, We need to remember what's important in life.
Leslie Knope," Friends, waffles, and work."
Leslie Knope," Or waffles, friends, work."
Leslie Knope, It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope, But work is third.
The Douche," So listen, Crazy Ira, check this out, okay? I'm at this club last night just killing it, the Snakehole Lounge."
Crazy Ira," Oh, yeah, is that a gay club? Hello? Shut up, ass."
The Douche," Come on, man."
The Douche, So I'm dancing on the floor with this super-hot chick.
Extra, Me so horny.
Crazy Ira," More like a dude, I bet."
Crazy Ira, Hello? Did you wet your whistle? I wish.
Extra,Me likey.
The Douche," No, no, no, no."
The Douche," She spent the whole night talking to her friend, arguing about their feelings."
Leslie Knope, That's me!
The Douche,Who knows? She's probably a lesbian.
The Douche, They were in the bathroom a long time.

Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you for that year over year maintenance cost analysis.
Ben Wyatt,That was really helpful.
Leslie Knope,You're so welcome.
Leslie Knope,I was thinking about you when I wrote it.
Leslie Knope,"Cause I was, um"
Ben Wyatt, 'Cause I told you I wanted to read it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,That's a good reason.
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, Chris wants to see us in his office."
Leslie Knope,I guess we should head over there.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, cool."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ben Wyatt,See you there.
Leslie Knope,"I'll see you there, Benjamin."
Leslie Knope,Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, ""Lesliemin."""
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Wow!
Ann Perkins,That was the most sexual tension I have ever seen in a conversation about documents.
Leslie Knope,It can't happen.
Leslie Knope,We could both get fired.
Ann Perkins,That's a dumb rule.
Leslie Knope,I know!
Ann Perkins,"Well, if you have to follow it, I would just suggest avoiding one-on-one, tensiony situations with him."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Good plan.
Chris Traeger,I am sending you two on a trip.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Really?
Chris Traeger,"The Indiana Little League Baseball Tournament is upon us, and Pawnee hasn't hosted it in 20 years."
Chris Traeger,"So, I would like you two to go to Indianapolis and state our case, because you two are my dynamic duo."
Chris Traeger,Right here.
Chris Traeger,Ah Ah And go team!
Ben Wyatt,Yep.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, everything you have is too sexy."
Leslie Knope,This is actually the dress that Julia Roberts wore as a prostitute in Pretty Woman.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I look really good in it.
Leslie Knope,"I need, like, a sweat suit or something."
Leslie Knope,I need to send out a signal that nothing is gonna happen.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, this is insane."
Ann Perkins,It's so obvious you're dying to be together.
Ann Perkins,And now you're going on a road trip?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you guys could literally ""get a room."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I could literally get ""afired."""
Ann Perkins,"All right, I will help you antiseduce him."
Ann Perkins,Just tell me what else you need.
Leslie Knope,"I need to think of unsexy, boring conversation topics we can talk about in the car."
Leslie Knope,I have a few ideas.
Leslie Knope,"We could discuss The New Yorker article ""The History of the Ladder."""
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We could talk about different dorms at Johns Hopkins University, and I could read from my Sonicare booklet."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I have a good idea!"
Leslie Knope,What?
Ann Perkins,Why don't you ask him about his penis?
April Ludgate,"Pawnee Zoo, monkey speaking."
Tom Haverford,Okay!
Tom Haverford,Everyone stop what you're doing and come with me.
Tom Haverford,All four of you.
Ron Swanson,Where are you going?
Tom Haverford,Leslie's not here today.
Tom Haverford,No boss.
Tom Haverford,We can do whatever we want.
Ron Swanson,I'm your boss.
Tom Haverford,"That's a good one, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Seriously.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,Here's the sitch.
Tom Haverford,"I developed a dope new game show where I ask couples scandalous questions, and they have to guess what the other one answered."
Tom Haverford,I call this Know Ya Boo.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that sounds like The Newlywed Game."
Tom Haverford,"Shut up, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,"It's not The Newlywed Game, okay?"
Tom Haverford,It is totally The Newlywed Game.
Tom Haverford,But big deal.
Tom Haverford,Everyone steals.
Tom Haverford,"My favorite movie is Love Don't Cost a Thing, with Nick Cannon, which is based on Can't Buy Me Love, which is based on Kramer vs. Kramer or something, which I think was Shakespeare."
Tom Haverford,"Don't know, don't care."
April Ludgate,And what exactly do you plan on doing with this game show idea?
April Ludgate,Are you going to shove it up your butt?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna test it out on you four bingbongs and work out the kinks, then hire actual attractive people, and make a demo."
Donna Meagle,What network is gonna buy a game show from you?
Tom Haverford,"There's a million networks out there, and they all need programming."
Tom Haverford,"Spike, G4, GSN, Fuse, WOW, Boom, Zip, Kablam, Slurp, Slurp Latin, Slurp HD."
Andy Dwyer,I love Slurp HD.
Andy Dwyer,Have you guys seen Ultimate Battle Smoothie?
Tom Haverford,That's a dope show.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so, basically every dorm allows bed lofting, but the students have really taken to it at Wolman and McCoy."
Ben Wyatt,Did you go to Johns Hopkins?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,Do you wanna play some music?
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Leslie Knope,Ann and I burned an awesome CD for the trip.
Ann Perkins,"Jimmy Carter's ""Crisis of Confidence"" speech, Learning to Speak Mandarin, 16 minutes of Old Timey Car Horn, and something called Banjo Boogie Bonanza."
Leslie Knope,"It's an amazing instrument, the banjo."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't realize it could be this loud.
Lauren,Hello?
Lauren,Hello?
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Lauren,Hi.
Lauren,"My class is here on a field trip, and I'm supposed to interview someone for a school project."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"You can wait at that table, and someone will be here sometime."
Lauren,But aren't you here now?
Ron Swanson,No.
Tom Haverford,"It's time to know your I don't have the instrumental backing track yet, but it's gonna say ""boo"" right there."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, everybody!"
Tom Haverford,Welcome to Know Ya Boo.
Tom Haverford,"I'm your host, Tom Haverford, and with me as always is my CGI puppy cohost, Bobby the Boo!"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, everybody!"
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's get to it."
Tom Haverford,First question.
Tom Haverford,"Fellas, which rock star would your lady bang if she could bang one rock star?"
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,"I believe I have heard Donna talk about Prince, a lot."
Tom Haverford,What'd your boo say?
Tom Haverford,Impressive!
Tom Haverford,"All right, Andy, which rock star would your lady get with?"
Andy Dwyer,"Um, this is almost too easy."
Andy Dwyer,Me!
Tom Haverford,Let's check in with your boo!
Andy Dwyer,Yay!
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Who is Jeff Mangum?
April Ludgate,The guy from Neutral Milk Hotel.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Neutral Milk Hotel.
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
April Ludgate,That's my favorite band.
April Ludgate,"I've told you that, like, a thousand times."
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember.
Andy Dwyer,Why wouldn't you pick me?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,You're not technically a rock star.
Tom Haverford,Booyah!
Tom Haverford,Somebody don't know their boo!
Tom Haverford,That's the sound bite that's gonna play when a fight breaks out.
Ron Swanson,"Look, little girl, can we postpone this for another day?"
Ron Swanson,It's unsettling having you just sit there.
Lauren,But my report's due tomorrow.
Ron Swanson,What's it on?
Lauren,Why government matters.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson,"It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teat until they have sore, chapped nipples."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna need a different metaphor to give this nine year old.
Ron Swanson,"What's your name, ma'am?"
Lauren,Lauren Burkiss.
Ron Swanson,"Lauren, my name is Ron Swanson, and I'm gonna tell you everything you need to know about the miserable, screwedup world of local government."
Lauren,You have mustard in your mustache.
Ron Swanson,"Don't sass me, Burkiss."
Ron Swanson,Let's get started.
Ron Swanson,"""Life, liberty, and property."""
Ron Swanson,That's John Locke.
Ben Wyatt,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Whale sounds.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You can change it if you want.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,This is such a great song.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I snuck an Al Green song in there."
Ann Perkins,I want them to get together.
Ann Perkins,Sue me.
Leslie Knope,Did you see this?
Leslie Knope,"According to their rules, we may not have enough hotel rooms within city limits."
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,It's a silly rule.
Ben Wyatt,But maybe they'll be reasonable and not care.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, maybe we could just point out to them there are tons of hotel rooms just outside city limits."
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,Have you been to the Granville Hotel and Spa?
Ben Wyatt,Uhuh.
Leslie Knope,They have the softest towels.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I gotta tell you."
Ben Wyatt,I love a nice towel in my life.
Leslie Knope,Me too.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's the simplest luxury, but it makes all the difference."
Leslie Knope,Their bath mats are amazing.
Leslie Knope,It's like stepping on a lamb.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hold on."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, come here."
Ben Wyatt,You've got an eyelash on your face.
Ben Wyatt,I got it.
Ben Wyatt,Make a wish.
Extra,Learning to speak Mandarin.
Extra,Unit three.
Leslie Knope,Get away from me.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm allergic to fingers.
Extra,Where are you going?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should just not talk to each other for the rest of the trip, and I'm just gonna concentrate on the presentation."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Extra,This is my little brother.
Extra,Next up.
Extra,"The delegation from Pawnee, please?"
Leslie Knope,"And, so, as you can see, Pawnee has 12 beautiful baseball diamonds, and our seats have extra cushioning due to the massive size of our average citizen."
Extra,I have to bring up what happened the last time Pawnee hosted this tournament.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Perd Hapley,Good evening.
Perd Hapley,We begin with our first story tonight.
Perd Hapley,"They're cute, they're cuddly, but now they're wreaking havoc at the State Little League Championship."
Perd Hapley,Pawnee's raccoon infestation.
Perd Hapley,Have these little bandits stolen our sense of safety?
Leslie Knope,The raccoon problem is under control.
Leslie Knope,"They have their part of the town, and we have ours."
Extra,Muncie is larger.
Extra,Bloomington is more central.
Extra,What's the advantage of doing it in Pawnee?
Ben Wyatt,The advantage is that it's a wonderful city.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look, I've been to fourty some odd towns in Indiana and Pawnee is special."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the people are passionate and kind."
Ben Wyatt,They love their city.
Ben Wyatt,They take pride in their work.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a very, very special place."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, it's Tom Haverford back here with Know Ya Boo."
Tom Haverford,Let's move to the next question.
Tom Haverford,Where is your favorite place to smush your boo?
Tom Haverford,Donna!
Donna Meagle,Back of my Benz?
Tom Haverford,Let's check in with your boo!
Tom Haverford,"He said, ""Her Mercedes""!"
Tom Haverford,Jerry and Donna on fire.
Tom Haverford,April?
April Ludgate,This question is gross.
Tom Haverford,That's kind of the point.
Tom Haverford,What's your answer?
April Ludgate,"In our bed, I guess."
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Tom Haverford,Where's your boo's favorite place to smush?
Andy Dwyer,At the Neutral Milk Hotel.
April Ludgate,Get over it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, you get over it."
Andy Dwyer,You like some other dude's band more than me.
Andy Dwyer,Do you even think Mouse Rat is the greatest band in the world?
Andy Dwyer,'Cause it's starting to not feel that way.
April Ludgate,That band is really important to me.
April Ludgate,"And, honestly, I've asked you to listen to them, like, a million times, and you never have, so "
Andy Dwyer,"'Cause their music is sad, and depressing, and weird."
Andy Dwyer,"And art is supposed to be happy and fun, and everyone knows that."
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,Forget it.
April Ludgate,"Fine, forget it."
Tom Haverford,Damn!
Tom Haverford,This game's got juice.
Ron Swanson,This is your lunch.
Ron Swanson,"Now, you should be able to do whatever you want to with this, right?"
Ron Swanson,"If you wanna eat all of it, great."
Ron Swanson,"If you wanna throw it away in the garbage, that's your prerogative."
Ron Swanson,"But here I come, the government, and I get to take 40% of your lunch. And that, Lauren, is how taxes work."
Lauren,But that's not fair.
Ron Swanson,You're learning.
Ron Swanson,Uhoh.
Ron Swanson,Capital gains tax.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Chris says congratulations and that together we're unstoppable."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, cheers, sir!"
Ben Wyatt,Yup.
Leslie Knope,You did it.
Ben Wyatt,"No, you did it."
Leslie Knope,"No, normally I do it."
Leslie Knope,"This time, you did it."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all right."
Leslie Knope,You should take the praise.
Extra,Can I get a shot of you guys?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, when this thing's over, do you wanna grab some dinner?"
Ben Wyatt,Chris recommended a place.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we were thinking about going to dinner, photographer."
Leslie Knope,You want in?
Leslie Knope,You wanna grab some grub?
Extra,"Uh, no, thanks."
Leslie Knope,They have great burgers.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you don't even know where we're going yet."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure they have great burgers there, though."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, photographer."
Leslie Knope,Last chance.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then, it's just us then."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I tried.
Ron Swanson,"And that, Lauren, is how FDR ruined this country."
Extra,"Lauren, ready to head back?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, I guess it's time for you to head home."
Ron Swanson,I've really enjoyed talking with you.
Ron Swanson,"You are, and this is not a joke, much smarter than most of the people who work in this building."
Lauren,"I liked talking with you, too, Mr. Swanson."
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ron Swanson,"Hang on, hang on, I have something for you."
Ron Swanson,This is a Claymore land mine.
Ron Swanson,Use that to protect your property.
Lauren,"Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson,You got it.
Tom Haverford,"Tommy Hilfiger iPhone app, finally."
April Ludgate,"Hey, your stupid Know Your Boo game made me and Andy get in a big fight."
April Ludgate,"He just sold his guitar, and he's, like, quitting music now."
Tom Haverford,What do you want me to do about it?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, welcome to the super awesome bonus lightning round."
Tom Haverford,First question.
Tom Haverford,"Andy, who did your boo say makes the best mac and cheese in the universe?"
Andy Dwyer,The universe?
Andy Dwyer,Kraft?
Tom Haverford,April said Andy.
Tom Haverford,Best couple ever.
Tom Haverford,You just won 50 points.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why?"
Andy Dwyer,We got it wrong.
Tom Haverford,Next lightning round thing.
Tom Haverford,Who is the number one Colts fan in the world?
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
Andy Dwyer,You set this whole thing up so I would be unmad at you.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, guess what, ain't gonna work."
Tom Haverford,You figured out April's trying to trick you.
Tom Haverford,That's worth 100 points.
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Goodbye.
Leslie Knope,You were really great in that presentation today.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thanks."
Leslie Knope,I liked the stuff you said about Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,That was really nice to hear.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Pawnee is a really special town."
Ben Wyatt,I love living there.
Ben Wyatt,And... And I look forward to the moments in my day where I... Where I get to hang out with the town and talk to the town about stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"And the town has really nice blond hair, too, and has read a shocking number of political biographies for a town, which I like."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"And I know we can get into trouble, but I can't take this anymore, and I feel like we have to at least talk about it."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's not just me, right?"
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not just you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Are you Are you all right?
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go see a man about some porcelain, you know what I mean?"
Leslie Knope,I'm not buying cocaine.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the bathroom.
Leslie Knope,"The whiz palace, as I like to call it."
Leslie Knope,"And I'm not calling Ann, so Ann, we have a serious code Ben."
Ann Perkins,"Well, it's not really code if you say his name."
Leslie Knope,"He told me that he liked me, and I'm gonna go make out with him right now."
Leslie Knope,On his face.
Ann Perkins,That's awesome!
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Leslie Knope,Read me the script.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,"""Leslie, it's Leslie Knope from the Parks Department speaking to you through Ann Perkins, friend and beautiful nurse."""
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"""Do not do anything with Ben."""
Ann Perkins,"""Be responsible, no matter how cute his mouth is."""
Ann Perkins,"""Your job is on the line!"""
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann!"
Ann Perkins,You wrote that.
Leslie Knope,"No, you-- Then, Leslie, Leslie, you don't know what you're talking about."
Leslie Knope,"I care about him very much, and I've had two and a half glasses of red wine, and what that means is I'm gonna go make out with him right now, and it's gonna be awesome."
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"No, you're supposed to talk me out of this."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Don't.
Ann Perkins,Stop.
Leslie Knope,"Shut up, Ann, I'm doing it anyway."
Ann Perkins,Yay!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,"When Ben told me that you had won the bid, I was wildly ecstatic, and I had to come up here and celebrate with you."
Chris Traeger,There is literally nothing in this world that you cannot do.
Chris Traeger,"So, what's the plan now?"
Chris Traeger,Should we take a long walk?
Chris Traeger,Minigolf.
Ben Wyatt,I'll probably Shouldn't we just go back to Pawnee?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Nonsense.
Chris Traeger,There's no reason to drive all the way back home.
Chris Traeger, I've got a perfectly good condo right here in the city.
Leslie Knope," Oh, we couldn't put you out like that."
Chris Traeger, Double nonsense.
Chris Traeger, I would love to have you stay with me.
Chris Traeger," Leslie, you can take the guest room, and, Ben, you have to sleep on my couch."
Chris Traeger, It is literally the comfiest couch you've ever been on.
Ben Wyatt, This is weird.
Leslie Knope, We're on Chris' couch.
Ben Wyatt," Yep, we are."
Ben Wyatt, And I'm wearing his clothes.
Leslie Knope, Well Well
Chris Traeger,"Sorry, I keep myself very well hydrated, and my bladder is the size of a thimble."
Chris Traeger, I urinate roughly 12 times a night.
Leslie Knope," I think I might go to bed, too, actually."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, yeah? Okay."
Ben Wyatt," Well, look Good job, again, today."
Ben Wyatt, It was
Leslie Knope," You, too."
Ben Wyatt, Really? Yeah.
Chris Traeger," Well, that was quick and to the point."
Chris Traeger, Here's a tip.
Chris Traeger," The key to a healthy urethra, radishes."
Leslie Knope," Good, I'm gonna go to bed."
Chris Traeger, Good night.
Leslie Knope, Good night.
Chris Traeger," Well, now I'm up."
Chris Traeger, You wanna Boggle? 
Lauren's Mom,Are you Ron Swanson?
Ron Swanson, I am.
Lauren's Mom," Okay, what exactly did you teach my daughter? "
Ron Swanson, You must be Mrs. Burkiss.
Lauren's Mom, Lauren was supposed to do a paper on why government matters.
Lauren's Mom, This is what she wrote.
Ron Swanson," ""It doesn't."""
Ron Swanson,Well said.
Lauren's Mom, Is this a joke?
Ron Swanson,"No, ma'am."
Ron Swanson, I legitimately believe that.
Ron Swanson, I'm a libertarian.
Lauren's Mom," Oh, that's nice."
Lauren's Mom," Well, she is a fourth grader."
Lauren's Mom, And fourth graders aren't supposed to have their heads crammed full of weird ideas.
Lauren's Mom, They're supposed to do cute reports and get gold stars.
Ron Swanson, I'm very sorry.
Ron Swanson, I was only
Lauren's Mom,And you ate her lunch? 
Lauren's Mom,And you gave her a land mine? Really?
Ron Swanson," Well, it seemed appropriate at the time."
Lauren's Mom, I How?
Ann Perkins," You know this is my house, right?"
April Ludgate," Yeah, hi."
Ann Perkins, Do you wanna come in? You okay? 
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate," Andy is totally mad at me right now, and I don't know how to deal with him."
April Ludgate, So I thought I would ask you.
Ann Perkins," You know, Andy and I broke up so long ago."
Ann Perkins, I don't think that I'd be the best source to Please.
Ann Perkins, What happened? 
April Ludgate,He doesn't think I like Mouse Rat.
April Ludgate," All I said to him was that this other band was better, but I don't know why he got all mad, because it's like an indisputable fact that they're better."
April Ludgate, They're a real band.
Ann Perkins," Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Ann Perkins," Well, Andy just wants you to be proud of him and his music."
Ann Perkins," So, this isn't really about being right."
Ann Perkins, It's more about being supportive.
April Ludgate," Oh, wow."
April Ludgate," I didn't realize you were a marriage counselor, Ann."
April Ludgate, Sorry.
April Ludgate, My instinct is to be mean to you.
Ann Perkins, I understand.
Chris Traeger, O-M-G.
Chris Traeger," Leslie, I read that same article."
Chris Traeger," ""The History of the Ladder."""
Chris Traeger,It's utterly fascinating.
Chris Traeger," Ben, you're gonna love this."
Chris Traeger," Really? Do you know that the original image of a ladder is in a cave in Valencia, Spain, drawn over 10,000 years ago."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt, How about some music?
Chris Traeger,This is amazing.
Chris Traeger, What is this?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, I love this song."
April Ludgate, The pit 
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate, You were in the pit We all were in the pit The pit I was in the pit You were in the pit We all were in the pit 
Andy Dwyer,What is this?
April Ludgate,Living out my dream.
April Ludgate, Playing a show with the greatest band ever.
Andy Dwyer, That's my guitar.
Andy Dwyer, You bought it back from Sewage Joe?
April Ludgate," I actually stole it from his office, but whatever."
April Ludgate, He's a weirdo.
Andy Dwyer," Maybe April doesn't think that we're the greatest band in the world, but, man, she loves me."
Andy Dwyer, And I love her.
Andy Dwyer," So, you know, who cares."
Andy Dwyer, I got the greatest wife in the world! 
April Ludgate,Stop.
Andy Dwyer, We're married! We're totally gonna do it later! 
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope," Well, actually, I think it's good that Chris showed up, 'cause I wasn't thinking clearly."
Leslie Knope," I love my job, Ben loves his job, and it's just not worth the risk."
Leslie Knope," Oh, hey."
Ben Wyatt, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Chris just wanted me to drop off these receipts.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, well, he's not here."
Ben Wyatt, He took off.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Uh-oh.
Ron Swanson," All I'm saying is, keep an open mind for a while."
Ron Swanson, Listen to your teachers and read all the books you can.
Ron Swanson," Then when you're 18, you can drink, gamble and become a libertarian."
Lauren, The drinking age is 21.
Ron Swanson, I know.
Ron Swanson, Another stupid government rule.
Ron Swanson, So you'll write a new paper?
Lauren, Yeah.
Ron Swanson, Can you autograph this one for me?
Lauren, Sure.

Leslie Knope,"Hey, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever in her new part-time job in the Public Health Department at City Hall, it's Ann Meredith Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is so nice!"
April Ludgate,"I put a poisonous gas in one of these balloons, so if any of them pops, you may die."
Andy Dwyer,"No, April, we would all die."
Andy Dwyer,Gases fill the volume of whatever container they're in.
Andy Dwyer,School.
Leslie Knope,We have activities every hour on your first day.
Leslie Knope,"10 a.m., Ann's first day waffle explosion."
Leslie Knope,11 a.m. The start paperwork jamboree.
Leslie Knope,"And then 12:00 noon sharp is the inaugural ""D-Ann-ce Party."""
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to City Hall, cupcake!"
Ann Perkins,How many of you are in here?
Leslie Knope,There's seven.
Leslie Knope,And you have an office mate.
Leslie Knope,"His name is Stuart, and he's kind of a grouch."
Ann Perkins,I have an office mate?
Stuart,Get these balloons out of here.
Ann Perkins,"Hi, I'm Ann."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Just to let you know, I gave the senior center project to Donna."
Ben Wyatt,Sounds good.
Ben Wyatt,The meeting's at 2:00?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Conference room ""C""."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I think at some point, you and I should probably make out with each other."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
Leslie Knope,The best part of any relationship is the beginning.
Leslie Knope,"No problems, no fights."
Leslie Knope,"Just white wine, cuddling, and crazy amounts of History Channel documentaries."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, we should take separate cars to the restaurant tonight."
Ben Wyatt,Chris is deadly serious about this
Leslie Knope, I know.
Leslie Knope,"I just don't wanna talk about it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'll see you tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"By the way, I have a meeting with Marlene GriggsKnope."
Ben Wyatt,Is that any relation?
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Just a coincidence.
Leslie Knope,We get it all the time.
Leslie Knope,We laugh about it.
Leslie Knope,But I've never met her.
Leslie Knope,She's Filipino.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just tell Ben she's your mother?
Leslie Knope,"Because Ben and I are in this amazing little bubble right now, and there's no room in here for Chris' stupid rules about us not dating or my ballbusting mother."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm sorry, but I don't think you thought this through."
Leslie Knope,You know what I should do?
Leslie Knope,"I should get my mother a oneway ticket to London, leaving today."
Leslie Knope,"And that way, Ben never has to meet her and I could visit her in London."
Leslie Knope,Everybody wins.
Ann Perkins,What if he sees a picture of her on your desk?
Ann Perkins,"What if Marlene says, ""Hey, have you met my daughter, Leslie?"""
Ann Perkins,"""She works in the Parks Department."""
Leslie Knope,"Stuart, please, could you give us, like, 45 minutes?"
Stuart,"It's my office, too."
Leslie Knope,Stuart.
Leslie Knope,That guy was rude.
Chris Traeger,I feel that some structural changes could really unlock this department's potential.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm?
Chris Traeger,I believe you are capable of much more.
Jerry Gergich,I'm not.
Chris Traeger,Nonsense.
Chris Traeger,Look in the mirror.
Jerry Gergich,Huh?
Chris Traeger,"You are an intelligent, charismatic, beautiful superhero."
Chris Traeger,"I'm making you head of Public Relations, which means you'll be leading the daily briefing sessions."
Ron Swanson,Excellent idea.
Ron Swanson,This is my favorite part about having a new city manager.
Ron Swanson,"They always try to shake things up, and their ideas are terrible, and it brings City Hall to a grinding halt."
Ron Swanson,"I just grab a few donuts, sit back, and enjoy the show."
Chris Traeger,"April, you are too valuable to just be Ron's assistant."
Chris Traeger,"So from now on, you are a multitasking executive aide, assisting the entire office."
April Ludgate,Is this a nightmare?
April Ludgate,"April, wake up."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I just wanna say that you are a wonderful employee and a terrific human being."
Tom Haverford,Meeting adjourned!
Chris Traeger,Tom.
Chris Traeger,I enjoy you.
Chris Traeger,You know what else I enjoy?
Chris Traeger,Your entrepreneurial spirit.
Tom Haverford,I did recently sell my Chronicles of Riddick DVD on eBay for $10.
Tom Haverford,Used the profits to buy the Bluray.
Chris Traeger,That's terrific.
Chris Traeger,I have an amazing project for someone of your talents.
Chris Traeger,You are going to digitize the entire city archives up on the fourth floor.
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,I hate the fourth floor!
Tom Haverford,"Last time I was up there, I saw someone buy crystal meth out of a vending machine."
Tom Haverford,It's a bad place.
Chris Traeger,You won't be alone.
Chris Traeger,Andy.
Chris Traeger,"Starting now, you are nobody's shoeshine boy."
Chris Traeger,"Starting now, you are an administrative assistant."
Chris Traeger,For three weeks.
Chris Traeger,Then back to shoes.
Andy Dwyer,Chris!
Andy Dwyer,"I wasn't super paying attention to what you just said that we'll be doing, but I will give 110 percent. Well, as soon as you repeat yourself in a more interesting way."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, what's up?"
Leslie Knope,Nothing much.
Leslie Knope,"Since I'm here, I just wanted to let you know that Marlene Griggs-Knope is my mom."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"Also, she can be cruel and difficult, and she makes snap judgments about people that she holds on to for a very long time."
Leslie Knope,And she's kind of a bully.
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"Go in there, you're gonna be great."
Ben Wyatt,God.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Ben Wyatt,I'm Mr.
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Looks like you got some shirt on your coffee.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,You know what happened?
Ben Wyatt,"I spilled it, but you know how it goes."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Fun anecdote.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,The county school district needs four new school buses.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"I'm being stonewalled by the board, and I'm hoping your office can help us out."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Really?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That's it?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, no."
Ben Wyatt,It It's probably not possible.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Then I'm confused, Ben, because you just told me it was."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Five seconds ago.
Ron Swanson,"I got a second box of donuts, if anybody-- What the [bleep] is this?"
Chris Traeger,"This, Mr. Director, is your new desk."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"This desk is the epitome of the Swedish concept of jamstalldhet, or ""equality."""
Chris Traeger,Imagine someone needs your attention.
Chris Traeger,Somebody say my name.
Jerry Gergich,Chris.
Chris Traeger,Swivel!
Chris Traeger,"What is it, Jerry?"
Jerry Gergich,You told me to say your name.
Chris Traeger,"And you did a great job, superstar."
Chris Traeger,Someone else say something.
April Ludgate,You look like a freak.
Chris Traeger,Swivel!
Chris Traeger,"April, that is not a very good attitude."
Chris Traeger,I will keep my eye on you from my circular desk where I can see everything.
Chris Traeger,Tiny swivel.
Chris Traeger,See how it works?
Ron Swanson,What about my office and its many walls?
Chris Traeger,That becomes a new public waiting room.
Chris Traeger,And we got rid of that giant pillar that was in front of your door.
Ron Swanson,I loved that pillar.
Ron Swanson,It made it really annoying to stand in my doorway.
Chris Traeger,"Well, get over it, because it's gone."
Chris Traeger,You're gonna be more accessible than ever.
Tom Haverford,The fourth floor.
Tom Haverford,"Small claims court, divorce filings, stateordered drug tests."
Tom Haverford,It's somehow both freezing and humid.
Tom Haverford,There's a whole room on the fourth floor where they store the knives they've confiscated from people who went to the fourth floor to stab someone.
Ethel Beavers,You from Parks and Rec?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Ethel Beavers,I'm here to show you around.
Andy Dwyer,"Nice to meet you, ma'am."
Andy Dwyer,What's your name?
Ethel Beavers,Ethel Beavers.
Ethel Beavers,Follow me.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, this is you."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, wow!"
Andy Dwyer,Double computers?
Andy Dwyer,I get my own office phone.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Wall Street."
Andy Dwyer,Buy more stocks.
Andy Dwyer,Now.
Andy Dwyer,This phone kind of smells like a butt.
Ethel Beavers,Try not to move things around.
Ethel Beavers,"Because technically speaking, this is still a crime scene."
Ethel Beavers,Here's your name tags.
Ethel Beavers,Here.
Tom Haverford,"Ethel, this shirt is from Theory."
Tom Haverford,Name tags make holes.
Tom Haverford,I'm not wearing this.
Ethel Beavers,Do what you want.
Andy Dwyer,"Bye, Ethel!"
Tom Haverford,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Remind me next time to ask her where she was when Lincoln got shot.
Andy Dwyer,"""Remind Tom Ask Something."""
Andy Dwyer,"You got it, boss."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Somebody made somebody a mix!
Leslie Knope,"And I definitely heard your feedback from last time, so I only put five Sarah McLachlan songs on this one."
Ben Wyatt,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,Should we talk about how you claimed your mom was a Filipino woman you'd never met?
Leslie Knope,Should we?
Leslie Knope,I was just trying to delay the inevitable.
Leslie Knope,"If this turns into something real, then we are gonna have to deal with Chris' rule, and parents, and annoying flossing habits, and a lot of unfun stuff."
Leslie Knope,But not yet.
Leslie Knope,I just want to enjoy the bubble for a little while.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Everything's good?
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not."
Ben Wyatt,I was completely flustered.
Ben Wyatt,I came off like an idiot.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, at one point, for no reason, I just took off my shoes and held them in my hand."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go ask her how it went, and I bet she loved you."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I loved him!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,He's a total pushover.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Very odd guy, though."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"He's like a goofy, spineless jellyfish."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Why do you ask, sweetheart?"
Leslie Knope,No reason.
Leslie Knope,Don't worry about it.
Leslie Knope,It's totally fine.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not fine."
Ben Wyatt,What if she starts going around telling people I'm a pushover?
Leslie Knope,No one's gonna believe that.
Leslie Knope,"When I first met you, I thought you were a fascist hardass."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"A cute fascist hardass, but still, you give off a very--"
Extra,Education Department now officially requesting 10 school buses.
Leslie Knope,I thought they only wanted four.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, now that I'm a pushover, why not ask for 10, or 20, or 100 new school buses and a fleet of school yachts?"
Ben Wyatt,How about that?
Ben Wyatt,Here's what we're gonna do.
Ben Wyatt,You are gonna tell me everything there is to know about your mom.
Ben Wyatt,"And I'm gonna have another meeting with her, and we're gonna have it out."
Leslie Knope,Or we could go to Belize and go scuba diving.
Leslie Knope,And we could look at the whale sharks.
Leslie Knope,"You're certified, right?"
Leslie Knope,Let's get you certified.
Jerry Gergich,"April, do you have that usage report that I asked for?"
April Ludgate,"Anything for you, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, come on."
Jerry Gergich,Why?
Gretel,Excuse me.
Gretel,"There's a sign at Ramsett Park that says ""Do not drink the sprinkler water,"" so I made sun tea with it, and now I have an infection."
Gretel,Sir?
Gretel,"Sir, are Are you listening to me, sir?"
Gretel,"Sir, I'm talking to you!"
Gretel,Sir!
Gretel,"Sir, are you aware that there is waste in your water system?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you need to be strong, powerful, decisive."
Leslie Knope,This is not a meeting.
Leslie Knope,It's a battle.
Leslie Knope,Normal meeting rules do not apply.
Leslie Knope,"I'll be my mom and I'm gonna be very harsh with you, and it's only because I like you a lot."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Go!
Ben Wyatt,Hello.
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,No preambles.
Leslie Knope,No introductions.
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and start talking.
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to discuss the new school bus.
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to discuss your rhyming, Dr. Seuss."
Leslie Knope,And you should be sitting by now.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,Just walk in and take a seat.
Ben Wyatt,Um.
Leslie Knope,"""Um"" is the sound in ""dumb."""
Leslie Knope,That's what she says to people.
Leslie Knope,And now you've crossed your legs like a woman.
Ben Wyatt,God!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, should we just start over?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, we need to put a pin in this."
Leslie Knope,"Here is a list of my mother's top starting with Persian rugs, ending with Daniel Craig."
Leslie Knope,You have 10 minutes to memorize it.
Ben Wyatt,"Deliverance, the movie?"
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,"So Jerry is, like, basically my boss now, which I'm never gonna work for him."
April Ludgate,"Ron's trapped in this weird desk prison, and I now work at this traveling IV station."
Extra,This Mort Jansen's office?
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Extra,"Tell Mort I said ""Your move."""
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,I wanna work up here with you guys.
April Ludgate,This is awesome.
Tom Haverford,How many more of those stupid documents do you have to scan?
Andy Dwyer,"Just this one, and all the ones in those boxes."
Tom Haverford,I gotta get out of here pronto.
Tom Haverford,Time to get those old ladies to do my work for me.
Tom Haverford,How?
Tom Haverford,By shining down on them with the Haverford charm ray.
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,If it isn't Ethel Beavers.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, beautiful?"
Tom Haverford,Julianne Moore just called.
Tom Haverford,She wants her hair back.
Ethel Beavers,Nobody named Julien called.
Tom Haverford,Never mind.
Tom Haverford,I just need to ask you a couple of questions.
Tom Haverford,"One, can you help me out with this project we're doing?"
Tom Haverford,"And, two, will you please invite me to your 30th birthday party?"
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Ethel Beavers,I'm making a test call to your phone to make sure it's working so you don't miss any more calls.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,Don't bother.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll just find an open window and plummet to my death.
Ethel Beavers,Okay.
Donna Meagle,This isn't gonna work.
Donna Meagle,"Okay, you did not just swivel away while I was talking to you."
Donna Meagle,This spaceship keyboard is driving me crazy.
Donna Meagle,"I'm down to one word a minute, and the word is ""perflipisklup"" because I can't fly spaceships."
Ron Swanson,"Donna, you know as well as I do these city manager shakeups always peter out."
Ron Swanson,You just have to wait.
Donna Meagle,Usually I'm with you.
Donna Meagle,"But this is Chris Traeger, the six million dollar man."
Donna Meagle,He won't quit.
Donna Meagle,So you need to swivel your ass down to his office and have a word with him.
Leslie Knope,Mommy.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Oh!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,That is so thoughtful of you.
Leslie Knope,Of course!
Leslie Knope,"I just figured, hey, why not put my mother in a good mood?"
Ben Wyatt,"So, it's my understanding that despite what I said in our meeting, you have somehow increased your request for more school buses."
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, but I'm having coffee with my daughter."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we could do this another time.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're gonna talk about this now."
Ben Wyatt,"Or if you'd prefer, I could put a permanent freeze on the education budget."
Ben Wyatt,It's your call.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, maybe you should talk to him, Mom."
Leslie Knope,He seems pretty self-assured.
Extra,There's nothing left.
Extra,It's over.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, hey, hey, don't say that."
Chris Traeger,"Now, come on."
Chris Traeger,Get yourself together and go out there and be the woman you always knew you could be.
Extra,Thank you so much.
Tom Haverford,Who was that?
Chris Traeger,I don't know.
Chris Traeger,"I saw her crying, and so I helped."
Chris Traeger,What did you wanna talk to me about?
Tom Haverford,"Look, Chris, I'm very flattered you thought of me for this amazing opportunity, but I don't really know if this gig is in my wheelhouse."
Tom Haverford,"I tend to work best with young, attractive people."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I have made you a project leader."
Chris Traeger,This is a big deal!
Chris Traeger,You should keep an open mind.
Chris Traeger,Let your brain unlock the door to your heart's future.
Chris Traeger,I made that expression up when I was 14.
Chris Traeger,Still in use today.
Chris Traeger,By me.
Chris Traeger,Gotta jam.
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,It's just not possible.
Ben Wyatt,"And don't even bother trying to outflank me either, because you will fail."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Where did all this confidence come from all of a sudden?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on."
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Ms. Griggs-Knope."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Marlene.
Ben Wyatt,There's probably a compromise here.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Compromise is usually a sign of weakness.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it is, according to Andrew Carnegie."
Ben Wyatt,"But your demands remind me of a different quote, from the great Bill Watterson."
Ben Wyatt,"""You need a lobotomy."""
Ben Wyatt,"""I'll get a saw."""
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I love Calvin and Hobbes.
Ben Wyatt,"Me, too!"
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, this is some of my best work."
Leslie Knope,This could not have gone better.
Leslie Knope,They are really hitting it off.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,Crisis averted.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, I am very glad you came back up here."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, me too."
Leslie Knope,Yeah So you have a deal.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, let me mull everything over, and then we can reconnect and hash things out."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"It might get rough, but that can be fun."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Ben can handle it.
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, I can."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It was a pleasure.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"What's so great is, she was impressed by you, too."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you could tell instantly."
Leslie Knope,The way you guys were connecting was really amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Now, what I'm thinking is that maybe we should go over to her house"
Ethel Beavers,You two are just the cutest things on four legs!
Extra,But why so much black?
Extra,It's like you're going to a funeral.
Andy Dwyer,"She's got a point, babe."
April Ludgate,"So, marry her then."
Extra,I wish!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, sorry to interrupt the love fest, but can you hand me that folder there, please, Ethel?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, great."
Tom Haverford,"Why you gotta be like that, Ethel?"
Ethel Beavers,Looks like someone got up on the wrong side of the crib.
Tom Haverford,"Stop laughing, Muriel."
Tom Haverford,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, I'm a genius."
Leslie Knope,The only thing my mom loves more than music boxes is McSteamy from Grey's Anatomy.
Leslie Knope,"So, I made her a McSteamystyle music box, and I thought maybe you could give it to her."
Leslie Knope,She would love you for it.
Ben Wyatt,I think maybe that's not such a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's not the best picture of him, but--"
Ben Wyatt,"Your mom kind of, um, made a pass at me."
Jerry Gergich,"So, Webster's dictionary describes a pork as a --No, it's park. Park."
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,"Geez, okay."
Jerry Gergich,"So-- You know what, can we start over?"
Jerry Gergich, Let's-- Let's go from the first thing.
Jerry Gergich," I said, pork, which By the way, they have a great pork sandwich in the cafeteria today."
Chris Traeger, Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson, Chris.
Ron Swanson, You have come up with a plan so spectacularly horrible that it might ruin the entire department.
Chris Traeger," Now, wait a minute."
Ron Swanson, I mean that as a compliment.
Ron Swanson," So, it pains me to say this."
Ron Swanson, My department has to go back to the way it was.
Chris Traeger, Give them time.
Chris Traeger, They'll adjust.
Ron Swanson," No, they won't."
Ron Swanson, They're miserable.
Ron Swanson," Tom only performs when there's someone to impress, so marooning him on Freak Island isn't helping anyone."
Ron Swanson, And you made April assistant to everyone? You know who April hates? Everyone.
Ron Swanson, And Jerry can only function if no one's looking.
Ron Swanson," You shine a light on him, and he shrinks up faster than an Eskimo's scrotum."
Chris Traeger," Well, that's very perceptive, Ron."
Chris Traeger," And, very graphic."
Chris Traeger," I understand your point, but there's no way that I can just roll over on this."
Ron Swanson, Okay.
Ron Swanson," You won't ever hear me say this again, so savor this moment."
Ron Swanson, I may have a compromise.
Ben Wyatt," Look, she was just flirting a little."
Ben Wyatt, I'm sure she's not really interested in me.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, I can't even have this conversation.
Leslie Knope, The whole thing is screwed up now.
Leslie Knope," There's so many ways to destroy a bubble, but my mom flirting with you is number one on the list."
Leslie Knope," And I'm sorry, I have to say this, were you asking for it in any way?"
Ben Wyatt,No! 
Leslie Knope,How were you dressed?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt, I was wearing this.
Leslie Knope, Here's what we do.
Leslie Knope," You issue a government-wide memo about sexual harassment, and then you go to Mexico."
Leslie Knope, Just for a couple of weeks.
Leslie Knope, Where are you going? Ben! Ben! Wait.
Leslie Knope," Just-- Hey-- Hi, Mom."
Marlene Griggs-Knope, Hi again.
Ben Wyatt, Leslie and I are dating.
Ben Wyatt, We haven't told anyone because there's a rule against office relationships.
Ben Wyatt, But it's happening.
Ben Wyatt," I'm sorry we didn't tell you before you touched my knee, and I trust you won't tell anyone now since it could get your daughter fired."
Marlene Griggs-Knope, That is hilarious.
Leslie Knope," That's what we thought, too."
Marlene Griggs-Knope, Well Four buses.
Ben Wyatt, Two.
Marlene Griggs-Knope, Deal.
Marlene Griggs-Knope, I like this one.
Leslie Knope," Me, too."
Leslie Knope, You keep your hands off him.
Andy Dwyer, Margaret's pecan squares.
Andy Dwyer, They are like crack.
Andy Dwyer, I brought you one.
Tom Haverford, How are you so happy working here?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, man."
Andy Dwyer, It's not that bad.
Andy Dwyer," A year ago, I lived in a pit."
Andy Dwyer," Now I got a job, and a kickass wife."
Andy Dwyer," And my band is so good, and are you gonna eat that pecan square? When life gives you lemons, make lemonade."
Andy Dwyer, I read that once on a can of lemonade.
Andy Dwyer, But I like to think that it applies to life.
Tom Haverford, I don't want lemonade.
Tom Haverford, It's too sweet and it makes my tongue feel gritty.
Tom Haverford, So maybe it's time for a change.
Tom Haverford," Starting now, when life gives me lemons, I'm gonna slice them up into wedges and throw them into vodka tonics, which I will then sip in a burlesque nightclub that I co-own with actor Taye Diggs and two of the Pussycat Dolls."
Donna Meagle, Here you go.
Jerry Gergich, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, Kind of figured you'd be back in your office by now.
Ron Swanson," Well, you know how new city managers are."
Leslie Knope, Seems like everyone else is back to normal.
Leslie Knope, How long do you have to do this?
Ron Swanson,A week.
Leslie Knope, Citizen request.
Leslie Knope," Swivel, swivel, swivel."
Leslie Knope, Hello.
Leslie Knope," I can help you in here, sir."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, man, you're really screwing this up."
Andy Dwyer, I'm gone for one day and this entire shoe shine stand falls apart.
Andy Dwyer, Everything I built.
Andy Dwyer, Jump up here.
Andy Dwyer, I'll show you how it's done.
Andy Dwyer," See, your problem is you're thinking too much."
Extra, Wow.
Extra, You're really good at this.
Andy Dwyer, Yes.
Andy Dwyer, I am.
Andy Dwyer," When I come back here in a few weeks, I don't want all my regular customers to not be here waiting for me because somebody screwed it up."
Andy Dwyer, Huh? Thanks.
Andy Dwyer, No problem.
Andy Dwyer," See you later, kid."
Extra, Wow.
Andy Dwyer, What a moron.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"We call it, open heart surgery."
Tom Haverford,"How about this, you buy a Gulfstream jet, take the wheels off."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Get them off of there.
Tom Haverford,"Turn the jet into an apartment building, people could live inside their own private jet."
Tom Haverford,We're currently coming up with business ideas for Jean-Ralphio
Tom Haverford,"because as of today, his bank account is blowing up."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I made my money the old fashioned way, I got run over by a Lexus."
Tom Haverford,"I still can't believe you made all that money in the lawsuit, you barely got hurt at all."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"do you want to get run over, because I know a guy, super gentle, minor scrapes and bruises, major dollars and cents."
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Tom Haverford,What are you amazing at?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I know it, we both know it, let's both say it at the same it."
Tom Haverford,Creating a spectacle.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Creating a spectacle.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Absolutely, that's absolutely what I have to do."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What does it mean?
Tom Haverford,"It means, audio, video, movies, 3D movies, nightclubs, iPhone apps, if its entertainment you're involved."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes of course I am.
Tom Haverford,And you call it entertainment 720.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, why why."
Tom Haverford,You gotta stop screaming.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I will I just get excited.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why do we call it entertainment 720?
Tom Haverford,because you're willing to go around the world twice for your clients.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That is unbelievable, but listen to me, listen to me."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna need you on my team to pull this off, all right?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I can't do this without you.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know man, I'd have to quit my job."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, I'll do it without you."
Leslie Knope,"I have some very important news about our favorite minihorse, Li'I Sebastian."
Jerry Gergich,Yay!
Jerry Gergich,Li'I Sebastian!
Leslie Knope,He died last night.
Tom Haverford,No.
Leslie Knope,"But we can take comfort in the fact that he is in heaven now, doing the two things he loves doing the most."
Leslie Knope,Eating carrots and urinating freely.
Ron Swanson,"When I walked in this morning and saw the flag was at halfmast, I thought, ""All right."""
Ron Swanson,Another bureaucrat ate it.
Ron Swanson,But then I found out it was Li'I Sebastian.
Ron Swanson,Halfmast is too high.
Ron Swanson,Show some damned respect.
Leslie Knope,"Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him."
Leslie Knope,"But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence."
Leslie Knope,"I got it, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"It's times like this, when someone or some horse passes, that you really take stock of your life."
Leslie Knope,You look around you and you start to realize what it is that you truly care about.
Leslie Knope,"For Li'l Sebastian, I imagine it was good fresh oats, a trough of water, and a willing sexual partner."
Leslie Knope,Or non-willing.
Leslie Knope,"He was a horse, so I think they had to do it either way."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey Ann, how's it going."
Ann Perkins,You don't have to pretend I know you're supposed to meet Leslie here.
Ben Wyatt,I'm also curious about how it's going.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie's busy, she's working on the Li'l Sebastian memorial service."
Ann Perkins,"But you know what, she gave me this note to give to you."
Ann Perkins,"And she also wanted me to kiss you deeply, which I'm gonna have to pass on."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I really like my part-time job here.
Ann Perkins,"My office mate moved down the hall, so I have this whole room just for me."
Ann Perkins,"And Ben and Leslie, who secretly meet here."
Ann Perkins,40 times a day.
Ben Wyatt,She drew a kiss monster on the note.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Look, you guys are totally welcome to use my office."
Ann Perkins,Just don't do anything on my desk
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, we don't, you know, we just like to work in the same place."
Ben Wyatt,and then we talk and hold hands.
Ann Perkins,"Yuck, that's somehow worse."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it sounded bad when I said it."
Leslie Knope,"From now on, we stop mourning Li'l Sebastian's death and we start celebrating his life."
Leslie Knope,That's what he would've wanted.
Ron Swanson,"Amen, we need to send that glorious beast into the great beyond with a display that rivals the Super Bowl Halftime Show."
Ron Swanson,Also the budget is 600 dollars.
Leslie Knope,So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.
Leslie Knope,Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, there's a 13th century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri that would be very appropriate."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song."
Leslie Knope,"Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better."
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
April Ludgate,"Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer, lead singer of Mouse Rat, you should know he doesn't get out of bed for less than $1,000."
Leslie Knope,"He sleeps on a futon, so"
Leslie Knope,We can give him 50 bucks.
April Ludgate,Sold.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian."
Leslie Knope,I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.
Ben Wyatt,It's just a list of facts.
Leslie Knope,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, mine says, ""You have a cute butt."""
Leslie Knope,That's weird.
Leslie Knope,Must be a typo.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry, it's probably a typo, because it probably should've said, ""You have a cube butt."""
Tom Haverford,Cause your butt's shaped like a cube.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"The question is, why is my memo different than everyone else's?"
Leslie Knope,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Ben Wyatt,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Tom Haverford,"Cube butt, cube butt."
April Ludgate,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Andy Dwyer,"Cube butt, cube butt."
Dr. Harris,"Well, the good news is this is just tendonitis."
Chris Traeger,How is that good news?
Dr. Harris,The other option was shoulder cancer.
Chris Traeger,Really?
Dr. Harris,No.
Dr. Harris,"Look, you exercise a lot."
Dr. Harris,You're in great shape.
Dr. Harris,Little things like this happen with men of your age.
Chris Traeger,Men of my age?
Chris Traeger,How old do you think I am?
Dr. Harris,Fortytwo.
Chris Traeger,"I am 44, and I plan to live to be 150."
Dr. Harris,Okay.
Chris Traeger,So.
Chris Traeger,What's the cure?
Dr. Harris,Get a time machine.
Dr. Harris,Go back to being 20.
Chris Traeger,"Dr. Harris, you are literally the meanest person I have ever met."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, all the permits cleared for the horse funeral."
Ron Swanson,What was that tone?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,I'm very sad about this.
Tom Haverford,Question!
Tom Haverford,Who's a genius?
Tom Haverford,"Answer, Tom Haverford."
Tom Haverford,"Reason, Jean-Ralphio just started an exclusive, high end production company, and he's willing to put on Li'I Sebastian's memorial service pro bono, just for the pub."
Tom Haverford,Pub is an abbreviation for publicity.
Ron Swanson,Jean-Ralphio is a clown.
Ron Swanson,"This is the memorial for Li'I Sebastian, not double coupon night at a strip club."
Tom Haverford,"First off, double coupon night is an incredible value."
Tom Haverford,"Secondly, this guy just started a business."
Tom Haverford,He's my friend.
Tom Haverford,It would really help him out.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything and make sure it goes great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, we trust you."
Leslie Knope,Make us proud.
Ron Swanson,Make him proud.
Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just Photoshop that out?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hi, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Chris Traeger,I'm dying.
Ann Perkins,What?
Chris Traeger,Tendonitis.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know if you should lead with ""I'm dying."""
Chris Traeger,"You're right, you're right."
Chris Traeger,So.
Chris Traeger,What's up with you?
Ann Perkins,I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I Sebastian's memorial service.
Chris Traeger,Li'I Sebastian died?
Chris Traeger,That's terrible.
Ann Perkins,"He was old, and he had a lot of ailments."
Ann Perkins,Like tendonitis?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,I don't have his chart in front of me.
Chris Traeger,Could you get it?
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,No There's no chart.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,Death is inescapable.
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I'm meeting him in your office in a few minutes, how do I look?"
Ann Perkins,What are you going for?
Leslie Knope,Sophisticated with a hint of slutty.
Ann Perkins,Bullseye.
Ann Perkins,It's so nice to see you so happy about a guy.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, I don't know, when I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect."
Leslie Knope,"I mean we have to sleep around, but weirdly it's kind of fun that no one knows."
Ann Perkins,I could see that.
Leslie Knope,But enough about me.
Leslie Knope,How's Ann?
Ann Perkins,I'm pretty happy right now generally.
Ann Perkins,Although I did see Chris today.
Ann Perkins,he always just throws me off.
Leslie Knope,Don't even talk about Chris.
Leslie Knope,"Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us."
Leslie Knope,And about how much he hurt you.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, there you go."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?
Leslie Knope,That's disgusting and wrong.
Leslie Knope,I don't even get Why would I I've never had sex with anyone anywhere.
Leslie Knope,"It's none of your You have the nerve, the audacity Ben is my boss, technically."
Leslie Knope,"And he is terrible, facewise."
Leslie Knope,"And how How do I know, frankly, that you're not sleeping with him?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe you are.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're trying to throw me off.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Check and mate.
Leslie Knope,This is an outrage!
Leslie Knope,Who do I call?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, you're just who I was looking for."
Ben Wyatt,Are you Did you forget the Did you Can I get that thing?
Ben Wyatt,"Can we just, uh Did you bring it?"
Ben Wyatt,This isn't convincing.
Leslie Knope,How did you find out?
Ron Swanson,We've worked together for a while now.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to think I know you pretty well.
Ron Swanson,"Plus, Ben buttdialed me last night."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, okay."
Leslie Knope,And this is how Eleanor Roosevelt would kiss.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Eleanor likes the tongue.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, show me Pelosi again."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, lay down."
Leslie Knope,Please tell me you hung up before Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Ron Swanson,Unfortunately not.
Ron Swanson,This is a scandal waiting to happen.
Ron Swanson,"If you get caught, which you clearly will, Chris will fire you."
Ron Swanson,And I won't be able to stop him.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, we're being very careful."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, President, Reagan, my blazer popped open."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Maggie Thatcher, let me help you with that."
Ben Wyatt,it's going to be a bumpy ride to this summit meeting.
Ben Wyatt,Our countries have a very special relationship.
Leslie Knope,Oh no.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you've proven your point."
Andy Dwyer,"In my heart, I'm sad you had to die."
Andy Dwyer,"Li'l horse, spread your wings and learn to fly."
April Ludgate,Horses don't fly.
Andy Dwyer,That's why I'm telling them learn to fly.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, help me."
Andy Dwyer,There's a lot riding on this.
Andy Dwyer,This is what Li'I Sebastian's gonna listen to in horsey heaven.
April Ludgate,"Okay, let me hear your favorite one so far."
Andy Dwyer,You're a champion little horse And you're dead You're the champion of death You're the champion of death
April Ludgate,"Maybe try to do one without the word ""dead"" so much."
April Ludgate,"Or ""death"" or ""you're dead."""
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,You're helping me already.
Leslie Knope,"So the only people that know are my mom, Ann, and Ron."
Leslie Knope,And they're not gonna say anything.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Just no more fooling around at work.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah."
Leslie Knope,We can't.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I mean, you know, a situation could arise where you do something good, and I congratulate you."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, kind of like this."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, ""Oh, congratulations."""
Leslie Knope,That feels appropriate.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, I think we can get away with that as long as we don't do stuff like this."
Extra,"Hey, lovebirds."
Extra,What do I do with this?
Leslie Knope,You can just leave it there.
Extra,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So my mom, Ron, Ann, and that guy."
Tom Haverford,For the memorial ribbons?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No doubt.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Which one floats your penis?
Jerry Gergich,They're all black.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe to the layman, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"Obsidian, onyx, midnight, lost soul, rolling blackout, sleeping panther, and void by Armani."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Jerry, does this look black to you, too?"
Chris Traeger,"Ann, so glad I found you."
Chris Traeger,Can I talk to you  for a minute.
Ann Perkins,"Um, okay."
Chris Traeger,"I need to ask you a question, and if you're uncomfortable answering it right now, you can take some time and think about it."
Chris Traeger,That would be okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay?
Chris Traeger,Is tendonitis symptomatic of something larger?
Ann Perkins,"Really, that's that's a question you wanted to ask me?"
Chris Traeger,"I'm just very worried, I'm not sure this doctor's been properly trained."
Ann Perkins,"You know what, Chris, I'm sorry, I'm not your nurse, and I'm not your girlfriend."
Ann Perkins,"And I thought I was twice and I was wrong, which was embarassing."
Ann Perkins,I'm just not ready to be your friend.
Chris Traeger,"Of course, I'm sorry."
Chris Traeger,I do hope we can be friends before I die.
Leslie Knope,Hey friend.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.

Leslie Knope,You should do that and you should get a massage.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate actually, my mom gave it to me for you."

Tom Haverford,"Cue music and lights, and Go Ladybug, go Coconut."
Tom Haverford,Coconut and Ladybug both in position.
Leslie Knope,"Not only was Coconut a friend, but she was also a lover."
Leslie Knope,Our deepest sympathy is with you.
Tom Haverford,Coconut just took a dump on the stage.
Tom Haverford,We gotta clean that up.
Tom Haverford,Code red.
Tom Haverford,Coconut just took a dump onstage.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,The maintenance guy bailed on us.

Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,That guy left?
Leslie Knope,What a Okay.
Leslie Knope,Start the video presentation.
Leslie Knope,I'll deal with it.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I need you to go get some propane."
Jerry Gergich,"No, what about my poem?"
Leslie Knope,"No one wants you to read a poem, okay, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"What everyone wants, what Li'I Sebastian wants, is for you to get propane."
Jerry Gergich,Fine.
Jerry Gergich,I'll do it for Li'I Sebastian.
Tom Haverford,"Now we have a special presentation, courtesy of the folks at Entertainment 7Twenty."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hope you brought a change of clothes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,'Cause your eyes are about to piss tears.
Donna Meagle,You nasty.
Tom Haverford,Who are we?
Tom Haverford,Where are we going in life?
Tom Haverford,What is the meaning of all of this?
Tom Haverford,These are questions Li'I Sebastian never had to answer because he was a horse.
Tom Haverford,"Instead, he just brought us joy and happiness."
Tom Haverford,And isn't that the point?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You gotta join the company.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm the bank.
Tom Haverford,You're the money.
Tom Haverford,"I know, J, but it'd be a big leap."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And I will take that leap with you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm Thelma, you're Louise."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You can't die full of regret.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why don't you live your life like that cow from the video?
Tom Haverford,He was a horse.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Because he followed his dreams.
Tom Haverford,There was no obstacle too large.
Tom Haverford,No mountain too high.
Tom Haverford,No valley too low.

Leslie Knope,"Next, we have a special musical tribute by Mr."
Leslie Knope,Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,"What's 5,000 times better than a candle in the wind?"
Andy Dwyer,"This song is called 5,000 Candles in the Wind."
Andy Dwyer,"Up in horsey heaven Here's the thing You trade your legs for angel's wings And once we've all said goodbye You take a running leap and you learn to fly Byebye, Li'I Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Byebye, Li'I Sebastian You're 5,000 candles in the wind Hey, why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?"
Ben Wyatt,Why is Perd Hapley unveiling the memorial stone?
Leslie Knope,"Because Joe from sewage had to hand out the armbands, and Perd had to fill in for Mortenson, and Mortenson had to fill in for Howser."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, why couldn't Donna do it?"
Leslie Knope,Because Donna's reading Jerry's Italian poem.
Leslie Knope,This is sort of a mess.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay, we're--"
Ron Swanson,"What the hell, Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,I thought I was supposed to lay the ceremonial wreath.
Ron Swanson,Why is Councilman Howser doing it?
Leslie Knope,Because you are doing something better.
Leslie Knope,"You are lighting the memorial flame, which is the greatest honor of all."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, congratulations."
Leslie Knope,"I saved it for you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Who caught you guys?
Leslie Knope,"A very nosy maintenance worker, and we talked to him, and now we're all friends, and he's not gonna tell on us."
Ben Wyatt,It's totally fine.
Ron Swanson,"I think if you would know one thing about me, it would be that I prefer laying wreaths to lighting torches."
Ron Swanson,I have cried twice in my life.
Ron Swanson,"Once when I was seven, and I was hit by a school bus."
Ron Swanson,And then again when I heard that Li'I Sebastian had passed.
Ron Swanson,"His memory will live on, as today we light a fire that will burn on for eternity."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, deep breath."
Ben Wyatt,I think we got through it.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry, you put propane in the eternal flame, right?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, they were out."
Jerry Gergich,So I just got a big thing of lighter fluid.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of the same thing.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,We planned that!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, wow!"
Leslie Knope,We planned that.
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Jerry Gergich,"Please, Ron, I am very sorry."
Jerry Gergich,I guess I put too much fuel in the torch.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I don't know, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,I think you're being hard on yourself.
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, are you mad at me?"
Jerry Gergich,"'Cause without eyebrows, I can't really tell."
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.
Leslie Knope,And we burned it off.
Leslie Knope,"This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable."
Ben Wyatt,"What, you want to break up?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I like you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then You want to tell Chris."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I like my job.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, what do we do?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, operation shutdown."
Leslie Knope,No more secret handholding.
Leslie Knope,No more smooching in Ann's office.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, when we're at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard, and we could still get fired."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, I'm in."
Leslie Knope,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's force of habit."
Tom Haverford,"So what do I do, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Do I stay here or roll the dice with JeanRalphio?
Tom Haverford,I can't tell you what to do.
Ron Swanson,Go with your gut.
Tom Haverford,My gut is really small and easily irritated.
Tom Haverford,I need someone to guide me.
Ron Swanson,"You have no interest in government work, and you slow everything down with your selfish attitude."
Ron Swanson,"I'd love for you to stick around, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,It'll be damn hard to replace you.
Ron Swanson,But I'll support you either way.
Tammy 2,Two of my lovers in one place.
Tammy 2,What a coincidence.
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Ooh, what happened here?"
Tammy 2,"And more importantly, does the carpet match the face?"
Ron Swanson,"If you're looking for trouble, take it somewhere else."
Ron Swanson,"An hour ago, a giant fireball consumed my entire face."
Ron Swanson,And it was far preferable to spending another second with you.
Tammy 2,Tell that to your pants tent.
Ron Swanson,It's just the way I'm standing.
Ron Swanson,"Go back to the library, where you belong."
Tammy 2,"Hey, Glenn."
Tammy 2,Wanna dance?
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm okay."
Tammy 2,Just one dance?
Tom Haverford,No.
Tammy 2,With mommy?
Ann Perkins,"You know, tendonitis is usually caused by overuse."
Ann Perkins,Have you been working out more than usual?
Chris Traeger,"I did do 10,000 pushups last week."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, really."
Ann Perkins,That might have something to do with it.
Ann Perkins,You need to relax.
Ann Perkins,You're in great shape.
Chris Traeger,For a 44 year old.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"That's how old you are, man."
Chris Traeger,You're right.
Chris Traeger,I've been overreacting.
Chris Traeger,I don't like thinking about death.
Chris Traeger,Death is the opposite of
Ann Perkins,Being alive?
Chris Traeger,Exactly.
Chris Traeger,Look at us.
Chris Traeger,Talking like friends.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,What the hell.
Ann Perkins,Friends.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,"What's the point in doing 10,000 pushups if you're gonna do them alone?"
Chris Traeger,"I'd much rather do 5,000 pushups with a wonderful woman."
Chris Traeger,Sitting on my back to increase my resistance.
Andy Dwyer," Copy of our new hit single, 5,000 Candles in the Wind, and the new full-length CD, The Awesome Album."
April Ludgate," Eighteen bucks each, 40 dollars for the set."
Kyle,That doesn't add up.
April Ludgate,You don't add up.
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
Andy Dwyer," Honey, you are awesome at this."
April Ludgate, Thanks.
Andy Dwyer," April, I need to ask you something, and it's the biggest thing I've ever asked anybody in my entire life."
April Ludgate," Honey, we're already married."
Andy Dwyer," No, this is way more important than that."
Andy Dwyer," April Ludgate, would you be my manager?"
April Ludgate,Seriously? Okay.
April Ludgate, Yeah.
William Barnes, Excuse me.
William Barnes, Are you Leslie Knope?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
William Barnes, My name is William Barnes.
William Barnes, Do you have a minute to talk?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Elizabeth Barnes, We really enjoyed the service.
Elizabeth Barnes, That fireball was truly amazing.
Leslie Knope, I'm glad.
Leslie Knope, 'Cause it was planned.
William Barnes," And you were also responsible for the Harvest Festival, correct?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, a lot of people contributed to that."
William Barnes, You don't have to be modest.
William Barnes, We know it was you.
William Barnes, You did an amazing job.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
William Barnes, We are part of a group that tries to identify potential candidates for political office here in town.
William Barnes, And we think that you might fit the bill.
Leslie Knope, Oh.
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, Which office in particular?
Elizabeth Barnes,"Well, there are a couple city council seats we think are vulnerable."
Elizabeth Barnes, And the mayor's term is up next year.
William Barnes, All we need to know right now is are you theoretically interested in running for office?
Leslie Knope,"Absotootly, I am."
Leslie Knope, Very sorry that I just used that word.
Leslie Knope, But yes.
Leslie Knope, I just I've dreamed about this moment for a long time.
Tammy 2, Guess I'll be heading home.
Ron Swanson, Catching the number 12 bus to Satan's butthole?
Tammy 2,"Actually, I prefer the number 69 train to Humpsville station."
Donna Meagle," Red alert, Swanson."
Donna Meagle, Your ex-wife is back.
Ron Swanson," No kidding, Donna."
Donna Meagle, Not her.
Donna Meagle, The other ex-wife.
Ron Swanson, Tammy One.
Donna Meagle, She's in your office.
Leslie Knope, Would I have to quit my job?
William Barnes,"Well, that's a long way off."
Leslie Knope, Of course.
William Barnes, But listen.
William Barnes," When you run, even in a local election, your life becomes an open book."
William Barnes," So if you so much as stiff a waiter on his tip or use a government stamp for personal mail, it will come out."
William Barnes," So before we go any further, I need you to tell me, is there a scandal out there? Is there anything at all you need to tell us about your life?"
Leslie Knope,Nope.
William Barnes, All right.
William Barnes," Well, we'll be in touch."
Tom Haverford," Yeah, I think we can do that for a million."
Tom Haverford," Okay, we'll talk soon."
Tom Haverford," There was no one on the other end of that phone call, but soon there will be."
Tom Haverford," Welcome to the Dreamatorium, A.K.A.  the headquarters of Entertainment 720."
Tom Haverford," We got a pool table, a ping-pong table, a couch with a ceiling on it, in-house DJ."
Tom Haverford, DJ Blunt.
Tom Haverford," And best of all, former NBA superstar Detlef Schrempf is on retainer."
Tom Haverford," What's up, Detlef? "
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Jean-Ralphio, who's sitting at my clear purple desk."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Tom Haverford,Who's this person?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Oh you're talking about this little sweetie right here?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This is our new assistant Tessa.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I saw her sweating real sweaty on the stairmaster.
Extra,"I need petty cash, my iPhone cover is gross and  I need to get a new one."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Get it to match your personality.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Petty cash, money bowl, go diving."
Extra,Gross.
Tom Haverford,Why do we  keep our petty cash in a clear plastic toilet bowl?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Maybe because we're flush with cash.
Detlef Schrempf,"So, Tom, what does this business do, again?"
Tom Haverford, It's a multimedia entertainment production conglomerate.
Detlef Schrempf," I don't know, man."
Detlef Schrempf, You have a lot of overhead here.
Detlef Schrempf, Ever thought about scaling back a bit and focusing on building your client base?
Tom Haverford,"Thanks a lot, Forbes magazine."
Tom Haverford, But we didn't hire you to give us business advice.
Tom Haverford, We hired you to look pretty and shoot baskets.
Tom Haverford," So why don't you head over there and do your thing? We want people to see you when they come in, Detlef."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"We may not have any clients yet, but we're about to blow up."
Tom Haverford,"First you set up the pond, then you real in the fish."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Big D, hit me! Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Come on.
Tom Haverford, We're living the dream.

William Barnes,"But your thoroughness, as always, is impressive."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
William Barnes,"Now, we have three months until you announce your campaign."
William Barnes,I think we should start talking strategy.
Leslie Knope,My strategy is to win.

Ben Wyatt, Ladies' yacht club?
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe you haven't told him yet.
Leslie Knope,"After I tell him, I'm running for office, we're gonna have to break up."
Ann Perkins,Why can't you just keep sneaking around?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful, naive, sophisticated, newborn baby."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"Before, if people found out, we would maybe lose our jobs."
Leslie Knope,"Now, if people find out, it's gonna be a major scandal."
Leslie Knope,My campaign will be over before it begins.
Ann Perkins,What are you gonna do?
Leslie Knope,I have a plan.
Leslie Knope,And it's really good.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna postpone telling him until you figure out what I'm supposed to do.
Leslie Knope,So get crackin'.
Ann Perkins,How is this on me?

Chris Traeger,"If I could go back in time, and cut your eyeballs out, I would."
April Ludgate,"Wow, that is so sweet."

Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I'm just now getting really good at shoe shining."

Tom Haverford,Are you living your dreams?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm living mine."
Tom Haverford,"And if you wanna live yours, here's my card."
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible to read.
Tom Haverford,"Black print, black background."
Tom Haverford,It's the coolest possible color scheme.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,It's also a strong magnet.
Tom Haverford,So don't put it in your wallet.
Tom Haverford,"It will erase your credit cards, guaranteed."
Andy Dwyer,Destroy my credit cards.
Andy Dwyer,Debt and everything?
Chris Traeger,Mr.
Chris Traeger,"Mayor, I promise you that we will find the owner of that weiner and we will punish him."
Chris Traeger,Goodbye.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"I didn't know who to come to with this, but that picture, uhthere's something very disturbing about the testicles."
Chris Traeger,I've always felt the same way myself.
Chris Traeger,The testicles are like the ears of the genital system.
Chris Traeger,"They serve a very important function, but they're not that great to look at."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, wow."
Ann Perkins,"No, I was speaking medically."
Ann Perkins,They're enlarged.
Ann Perkins,"I think that maybe that guy is sick with something perhaps, a hernia, or mumps."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,You really know your testes.
Ann Perkins,Thank you?
Perd Hapley,"For a female perspective on this scandal, we turn to a woman, Leslie Knope."
Perd Hapley,I'm about to ask you a question right now and that question is this.
Perd Hapley,The lewd photo just how big a deal is it?
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, Perd, it's not that big a deal."
Leslie Knope,If you know what I mean.
Perd Hapley,I don't know what you mean.
Perd Hapley,But it had the cadence of a joke.
Leslie Knope,"When men in government behave this way, they betray the public's trust."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time for more women to be in charge.
Perd Hapley,"There you have it, where ""it"" is the thing Leslie Knope just said about this situation."
Perd Hapley,Perd Hap
Leslie Knope,How was that?
Leslie Knope,Was that okay?
Elizabeth Barnes,Amazing.
Elizabeth Barnes,That sound bite is gold.
William Barnes,"You're gonna get great feedback on this, and we think we can capitalize."
William Barnes,You're gonna announce your candidacy on Friday.
Leslie Knope,Friday.
Leslie Knope,In three months.
William Barnes,"No, this Friday."
William Barnes,Is that okay?
Leslie Knope,"No, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we'll do that then now soon."
Leslie Knope,"And, um, I just have something I've been postponing for a while that I need to do, but I'll do it now."
William Barnes,Great.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Yea.
Ben Wyatt,I know it.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you.
Ben Wyatt,That was my brother.
Ben Wyatt,He just had a baby girl.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's horrible."
Leslie Knope,Or good full disclosure.
Leslie Knope,I didn't listen to what you just said.
Leslie Knope,I need to talk to you about something
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, before you say anything, let me just show you what I got at Doug's Donuts."
Ben Wyatt,It's an Lshaped eclair!
Ben Wyatt,"The ""L"" is for Leslie For your name."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,How are you?
Leslie Knope,"Bad, really bad."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,How did the breakup go?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I started crying because he gave me an eclair."
Leslie Knope,And then we made out and spent the night together.
Leslie Knope,"But this morning in the cold light of day, I cooked breakfast and we made out some more."
Ann Perkins,"Wow, you opposite of broke up with him."
Leslie Knope,"He gave me an eclair, Ann!"
Ben Wyatt,"Joe, I've determined that the lewd picture was sent by you because you sent it from your personal email address, stinkmaster69@alumni.sarahlawrencecollege.edu."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Sarah Lawrence?
Joe From Sewage,Yeah.
Joe From Sewage,I wanted a small college experience.
Ben Wyatt,You also bragged about it to many of your coworkers.
Joe From Sewage,There's an old sewage department saying.
Joe From Sewage,"""If you've got a nice drainpipe, there's no reason to hide it."""
Ben Wyatt,I doubt that's a saying.
Ben Wyatt,We are terminating you effective immediately.
Joe From Sewage,Is this because you're jealous?
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,It's because you broke the law.
Joe From Sewage,The law of having an amazing package.
Chris Traeger,"Before we have him forcibly removed, you should know this, that one of our female employees, a nurse, examined the photo you sent her"
Joe From Sewage,I bet she did.
Chris Traeger,And you have the mumps.
Chris Traeger,You might wanna get that checked.
Joe From Sewage,Sweet.
Joe From Sewage,Someone's got mumps on his lumps.
Joe From Sewage,Up high.
Joe From Sewage,Anyone?
April Ludgate,Ron isn't here.
April Ludgate,"His exwife Tammy came, and he got scared and ran away."
April Ludgate,"Well, as acting manager of the Parks Department, I declare that everything you are saying is stupid."
April Ludgate,I love you.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, so Tom offered me a job again."
Andy Dwyer,"As my manager, what do you think I should do?"
April Ludgate,"Well, what do you wanna do?"
Andy Dwyer,I think it'd be kinda cool to work for Tom.
April Ludgate,So take it.
Andy Dwyer,But working at a startup can be kind of risky.
April Ludgate,So don't take it.
Andy Dwyer,But Tom told me to follow my dreams.
April Ludgate,So take it.
Andy Dwyer,But this isn't my dream.
April Ludgate,So don't take it.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,Me neither.
Andy Dwyer,You give such good advice.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I love you."
April Ludgate,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Did you maybe tell people that I diagnosed that guy with mumps based on his porn photo?
Chris Traeger,I did!
Chris Traeger,I was so proud of you.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, because now I have everyone in City Hall sending me pictures of their junk, asking me if they have mumps."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,Your inbox is literally filled with penises.
Ann Perkins,Mmhmm.
Chris Traeger,I am so sorry.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, look."
Ann Perkins,Ed Miller from payroll.
Leslie Knope,"Before I do this, is there any possible way that we could still keep dating?"
Ann Perkins,We've attacked this from all angles.
Ann Perkins,Either you don't run for office
Leslie Knope,Which is out of the question.
Ann Perkins,Or you break up with him and avoid a potential scandal.
Leslie Knope,Do you need to get that?
Ann Perkins,"No, it's just penises."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't want you to break up with him either."
Ann Perkins,There's just no other way.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Just be direct and honest.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Hmm.
Ann Perkins,It's the entire Sanitation Department for Muncie.
Ann Perkins,Ooh.
Extra,Would you like any wine to start?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and I'm gonna be direct and honest with you."
Leslie Knope,I would like a glass of red wine and I'll take the cheapest one you have because I can't tell the difference.
Ben Wyatt,I'll have the same.
Extra,Great.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Here's the deal.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"I really, really like you."
Ben Wyatt,I like you too.
Ben Wyatt,And I think I know what you're gonna say.
Leslie Knope,I highly doubt that.
Ben Wyatt,I think I do.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't."
Ben Wyatt,"And, um  I got you something."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Is this jewelry?
Ben Wyatt,"It's not, just open it."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I need to go to Another place."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go to the bathroom the Whiz Palace, as we like to call it here and I'm going to be back and I'm not gonna split."
Leslie Knope,I'm here for you because we need to talk about stuff.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,Wait  Ron.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,Running away from my problems.
Ron Swanson,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Ok, so here's what's going on."
Ron Swanson,I didn't ask.
Leslie Knope,"Friday, I'm supposed to announce that I'm running for City Council, and I haven't told Ben yet."
Leslie Knope,"I know I said that we broke up, but we couldn't."
Leslie Knope,We're still dating.
Leslie Knope,"But now I have to break up with him for real, but I don't wanna break up with him because he's so cute."
Leslie Knope,He's so nice.
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna stay here, there are three rules you need to follow."

Ron Swanson,You lose your coffee privileges.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you choose, Knope hunting, fishing, or drinking?"
Leslie Knope,I'd really love to shoot a gun right now.
Ron Swanson,Fishing it is.
Chris Traeger,"And so effective immediately, all male employees must stop sending explicit photos to Ms. Perkins."
Extra,"If I may, what if based on empirical evidence, I truly believe there's a grave and immediate medical emergency?"
Extra,"Were that the case, could I then show you my dong?"
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,That would be harassment.
Extra,Fair enough.
Extra,Now completely different scenario.
Extra,Let's say I've been watching a lot of women's golf and I've had some wine
Ann Perkins,How about this?
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna get a male doctor to come in and do some screenings.
Extra,Perfect.

Ann Perkins,That will not be necessary.
Extra,That's me.

Jerry Gergich,Ma'am.
Tom Haverford,Sodid you get a chance to think about my offer?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you said."
Andy Dwyer,"I wanna do my dreams, but I just don't think my dream is working for a company that puts logos on stuff."
Tom Haverford,That's not my company does.
Tom Haverford,"Although, maybe we'll start."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, what you think?"
Tom Haverford,Donna that looks great.
Donna Meagle,I could do without this one.
Ron Swanson,So running for office.
Ron Swanson,Now I'm gonna have to find a replacement for you.
Leslie Knope,I might not win.
Ron Swanson,You'll win.
Leslie Knope,I might not run.
Ron Swanson,You should.
Ron Swanson,"What's our plan here, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"I figure we build a fire, roast the fish we shot, and make s'mores."
Ron Swanson,I don't have the material for s'mores.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I always carry emergency s'more rations in my car.
Leslie Knope,"Given your hunting abilities and my chocolate supply, I figure we could stay up here for two three years."
Ron Swanson,"You know, when I was 12, my brother shot me in the pinky toe with a nail gun."
Ron Swanson,"Granted, it was a hilarious prank, and we all had a good laugh."
Leslie Knope,That's awful.
Ron Swanson,But I avoided going to the doctor.
Ron Swanson,I hate paperwork.
Ron Swanson,"After a few weeks, the toe just kinda fell off."
Leslie Knope,You only have nine toes?
Ron Swanson,I have the toes I have.
Ron Swanson,Let's just leave it at that.
Ron Swanson,"The point is the doctor said if I had come in right away, they might've saved the toe."
Ron Swanson,You can't run away from your problems.
Leslie Knope,Especially if you only have nine toes.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was uncalled for.
Ron Swanson, I'm Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson, And you're Leslie [bleep] Knope.
Ron Swanson, You with me? 
April Ludgate,"Well, what is your dream?"

April Ludgate,"Andy, there's tons of stuff you can do."
April Ludgate, I'll help you figure it out.

April Ludgate,You're running for office?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, City Council."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, that is great."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Donna Meagle, Will you pledge right now not to raise taxes?
Leslie Knope,I think that's premature.
Donna Meagle,"No pledge, no vote."
Ron Swanson, The point is she needs an assistant.
Ron Swanson,Start asking around
April Ludgate,Hire Andy.
April Ludgate,Andy can do it.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah."

April Ludgate," No, honey, no."
Leslie Knope," Tomorrow, there will be a 300 page orientation booklet as well as a dozen homemade cookies in the shape of your face."
Leslie Knope, But today There's something else I have to do.
Ron Swanson," If any of you need anything at all, too bad."
Ron Swanson, Deal with your problems yourselves like adults.
Ron Swanson," I'll be in my office, waiting for Tammy one."
April Ludgate, You want me to find her?
Ron Swanson,There's no need.
Ron Swanson, She'll find me.
Ron Swanson, She has the tracking ability and body odor of a bloodhound.
Jerry Gergich," Okay, so now you're sure that everything is okay, you know, down there?"
Dr. Harris,You're perfectly healthy.
Dr. Harris, That man has the largest penis I have ever seen.
Dr. Harris, I actually don't even know if he has mumps.
Dr. Harris, Forgot to look.
Dr. Harris, I was distracted by the largest penis I have ever seen.
Leslie Knope," I know I've been acting really weird lately, and, um, I really like you."
Leslie Knope," What I'm about to say is gonna contradict the idea that I really like you, but that won't change"
Ben Wyatt,So just open the box.
Leslie Knope," Please stop bringing out the box, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie
Leslie Knope,"You're being really nice, and what I'm about to say is gonna make you hate me."
Ben Wyatt," Okay, then I'll just open the box for you."
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, You knew?
Ben Wyatt,I figured it out a while ago.
Ben Wyatt, I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt, I should've told you I knew.
Ben Wyatt, But I just I wanted this to last as long as possible.
Ben Wyatt, We have to break up.
Leslie Knope, Why? Why do we have to break up?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie, everything you've accomplished, you have earned and you have worked for."
Ben Wyatt, I don't want anyone to think that you got where you are today by sleeping with your boss.
Leslie Knope, But I really like sleeping with my boss.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah Yeah.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, look."
Ben Wyatt, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
Ben Wyatt," Um, it's not you, it's me."
Ben Wyatt, I'm not ready for a commitment.
Ben Wyatt, I just don't like you anymore.
Ben Wyatt," I know it's hard to hear that, but You're boring, and frankly you disgust me."
Ben Wyatt, Echh!
Leslie Knope,How did you figure it out?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, there was a dude in the ladies' yacht club."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, but I covered that pretty well."
Ben Wyatt," Also, you've been making campaign speeches in your sleep."
Ben Wyatt," Granted, you always do that, but they got really specific and moving."
Leslie Knope, Did I have a good opening line?
Ben Wyatt,"It was simple, but I liked it."
Leslie Knope," Friends, honored guests, Pawneeans."
Leslie Knope," I am Leslie Knope, and I am running for City Council."

Tammy 1," You're being audited, Ronald."

Tammy 1, Wrong.
Tammy 1, You do.
Tammy 1," But as you're so fond of saying, it's a free country."

Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Screw this.
Ron Swanson,"First of all, income tax is illegal."
Ron Swanson,"Second, Tammy is a psychological mastermind."
Ron Swanson,This is just another way for her to put her hand up my keister and control me like a puppet.
Ron Swanson,I'd rather be locked up.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, this is a federal tax audit."
Leslie Knope,You could go to jail.
Leslie Knope,"Jail, Ron."

Tom Haverford,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Look, we got some documents over at Entertainment720 that seem really complicated."
Tom Haverford,"And I thought, maybe you could take a look at them because nerd stuff probably really excites you, because you're a nerd."
Ben Wyatt,"No, of course."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I just put on my Star Wars pajamas and sit in my mom's basement and pore over some spreadsheets."
Ben Wyatt,Sounds great.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.

Ben Wyatt,I can hear you.
Tom Haverford,"I know you can, Ben."
Tom Haverford,That's how easy it is.
Ron Swanson,So we need to find proof of every tax deduction I've taken in the last five years.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, most of these aren't even receipts."
Leslie Knope,"This one says, ""I bought supplies. 2007."""
Ron Swanson,You won't find any bank statements either.
Ron Swanson,I've heavily invested in gold which I've buried in several different locations around Pawnee.
Ron Swanson,Or have I?
April Ludgate,What's this?
April Ludgate,Some kind of lame drug deal?
Ron Swanson,That is a gentleman's agreement.

Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I am flattered.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Get a thicker tie.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It looks weird on you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Makes your head look like a fish.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Secondly, I don't know where the paperwork is, but when you find it, can you take care of it for us?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We don't have any pens 'cause we're afraid it's gonna leak in our shirts.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Lastly, I hate the name, Angelo."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'ma switch it up for you, right now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Your new nickname is Jello shot.

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you have questions?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Where are we?
Tom Haverford,"All right, Ben."

Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hit it!
Ben Wyatt,"Um, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Are you the receptionist?
Extra,I guess.
Extra,I don't really know.
Ben Wyatt,"If you don't mind me asking, how much are they paying you?"
Extra,"$100,000 a year."
Extra,With full medical.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I would guess they'll be bankrupt by the end of This sentence."
Ben Wyatt,"No, thank you."
April Ludgate,Is this true?
April Ludgate,You only spent 40 dollars on clothes in the past 5 years?
Ron Swanson,It sounds about right.
Leslie Knope,How did you meet Tammy One?
Ron Swanson,"Technically, I've known her since I was born."
Ron Swanson,She was a candy striper at the hospital.
Ron Swanson,She helped deliver me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,I grew up in a very small town.
Ron Swanson,Everybody knew everybody else.
Ron Swanson,We first took up together when I was 15.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,"It was a little scandalous, but everyone feared her, so they kept their mouths shut."
April Ludgate,"I don't even know her, but she's my hero."
Ron Swanson,"No, she's no hero, April."
Ron Swanson,She's a hellacious nightmare.
Ron Swanson,"She did, however, teach me everything I know."
Ron Swanson,"Sunday school, sex."
Ron Swanson,"She was my math teacher in middle school and my babysitter, and she taught driver's ed."
Ron Swanson,I Hello.
Leslie Knope,I don't believe we've met.
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, deputy"
Tammy 1,I don't think it will be necessary for you to speak again while I'm here.
Ron Swanson,Why do I only date brunettes?
Ron Swanson,"You know, sometimes you eat chicken and you get food poisoning and then, even the sight of chicken makes you sick?"
Ron Swanson,Tammy One is my blonde chicken.
Tammy 1,"Good God, Ronald."
Tammy 1,This is a much bigger mess than I imagined.
Tammy 1,You'll take a week off from work.
Tammy 1,We'll do a complete overhaul of your finances.
Tammy 1,"I'll need access to all your accounts, and your home."
Ron Swanson,Is that necessary?
Tammy 1,"Oh, oh."
Tammy 1,We're playing a game where everyone says something stupid?
Tammy 1,You.
Tammy 1,What is your name?
Andy Dwyer,Tim.
Andy Dwyer,Tim Buckenowski.
Tammy 1,Really?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer.
Tammy 1,"Andy You're going to collect all of this, and you're going to put it in my car."
Tammy 1,What  Ms.
Tammy 1,Knope.
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Tammy 1,You're going to go to payroll and get copies of Ronald's workplace expense reports.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, II'm just wondering how long that's going to take, because Ron and I have a very important meeting together."
Leslie Knope,It's called the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope,It's super fun.
Tammy 1,"Well You and Ron have a big meeting, huh?"
Tammy 1,I'm sure Ron will remember the meeting fondly while he makes toilet wine in a federal prison in Terre Haute.
Leslie Knope,I'll I'll head down to payroll.
Tammy 1,Now.
Tammy 1,You're not getting any younger.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, ma'am."

Ron Swanson,"Good morning, everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Good morning, sir."
Leslie Knope,How can I help you?
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,Your moustache fell off.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you goofball."
Ron Swanson,Tammy pointed out that my face looked better without any hair on it.
Ron Swanson,"And it did collect a lot of food crumbs, which is very unsanitary."
Ron Swanson,"Hey, Jer."
Ron Swanson,"Hump day, am I right, buddy?"
Jerry Gergich,What?
Leslie Knope,What is going on?
Leslie Knope,Where's Tammy One?
Ron Swanson,She moved in with me.
Ron Swanson,She's really helping me out.
Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, she converted my bank account into a joint bank account with her."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,And how is that gonna help?
Ron Swanson,Not sure.
Ron Swanson,"When she explains it, it makes total sense."
Ron Swanson,It is so nice having her around.
Ron Swanson,Here's something neat.
Ron Swanson,Tammy's got me taking baby aspirin to lower my risk of heart disease.
Ron Swanson,Science is a miracle.
Ron Swanson,"Anywho, back to the old grindstone."
Ron Swanson,These emails aren't gonna send themselves.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes can't be cured.
Chris Traeger,But it can be prevented.
Chris Traeger,Make a choice.
Chris Traeger,Make a change.
Chris Traeger,"And together, we can make a difference."
Chris Traeger,What do you think?
Chris Traeger,Any notes?
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,"Just as good, if not exactly the same as the last one."
Chris Traeger,"In that last one, I left a nanosecond of a pause between the words, ""together"" and ""we."""
Chris Traeger,It felt much better.
Chris Traeger,But I'd love to try another one.
Ann Perkins,I really think we've got it.
Chris Traeger,Ann.
Chris Traeger,This is important to me because it's important to you.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, you spent a lot of time and energy on writing this."
Ann Perkins,Not really.
Chris Traeger,"So, it needs to be perfect."
Chris Traeger,"So, let's do 1 more, then 5 more, then 20 in a row."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, look who it is."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hey, hey."
Ben Wyatt,Tom.
Ben Wyatt,Jean-Ralphio.
Ben Wyatt,Professional basketball players.
Roy Hibbert,"'Sup, Jello shot."
Ben Wyatt,Can I ask you guys a question?
Ben Wyatt,How exactly are you making money?
Tom Haverford,Wanna know how we make money?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you wanna know how we make money?
Tom Haverford,By literally printing out our money.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We bought a printing press.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,This prints bills with our faces and the e720 logo on them.
Tom Haverford,"And promote the company by going to clubs and tossing the bills in the air and screaming, ""Free money!"""
Ben Wyatt,You can't just print your own money.
Ben Wyatt,"This has to stop, right now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Aww!
Tom Haverford,"What's the deal, baby?"
Tom Haverford,"One second, you hit the party switch, and the next second, you're all business?"
Ben Wyatt,I need to see all of your books.
Tom Haverford,"You got it, baby."
Tom Haverford,Baby!
Tom Haverford,Get him the books.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Aww, Snapple."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Are we calling everybody ""baby"" now?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"'Cause honestly, I love that."
Tom Haverford,"Are we saying ""Snapple"" anytime we think something's dope?"
Tom Haverford,"'Cause I love that, baby."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you know what I love?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hibbert, Hibbert."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Hup, Jello shot!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Tom Haverford,Jello shot!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jello shot!
Extra,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"We're here to serve you, friend."
Ron Swanson,I hope the rest of your day is cool beans.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what is this memo you sent to me?"
Leslie Knope,You're not going to the battle royale?
Ron Swanson,I have decided not to attend this year.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first of all, it's disturbing that you wrote a memo, at all."
Leslie Knope,But you love arguing against government spending.
Leslie Knope,Why do you not wanna do it now?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, please."
Ron Swanson,The government knows what it's doing.
Ron Swanson,I'm confident that I'll-- Ouchie.
Leslie Knope,You and I are going to lunch.
Leslie Knope,We have to talk.
Ron Swanson,Let me just call Tammy first and get permission.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, I was wondering if I could go to lunch with Leslie?"
Ron Swanson,Terrific.
Ron Swanson,Bye.
Ron Swanson,She says I can't go.
Leslie Knope,You're going to lunch with me.
Leslie Knope,I say you can go.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, gosh."
Ron Swanson,I'm really in a pickle now.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"When Ron falls for Tammy Two, he turns into a demonic sex maniac."
Leslie Knope,But this?
Leslie Knope,Neutered wimp?
Leslie Knope,This is worse.
Leslie Knope,"Operation ""Golden Dove"" is in trouble."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there are some things I want to speak to you about but I'm not quite sure how to phrase them."
Ron Swanson,"Just blurt them right out, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Anything you say will stay between you and me.
Ron Swanson,"Right, my love?"
Tammy 1,Stop fidgeting.
Ron Swanson,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping to speak with Ron alone.
Tammy 1,He wants me here.
Tammy 1,He invited me.
Tammy 1,Nanananana.
Ron Swanson,"Don't worry, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Tammy's totally cool.
Leslie Knope,"Huh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Then I'll say it to her.
Leslie Knope,"You're evil, and you need to go."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you are a panic."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, may I use the restroom?"
Tammy 1,Remember to wash your hands.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,Let's cut the crap.
Leslie Knope,Is this audit even real?
Tammy 1,"In a sense, yes."
Tammy 1,"But in another, truer sense, no, it is not."
Tammy 1,"I want Ronald back, but I had to learn about his finances, to make sure my future was protected."

Ron Swanson,Every guy needs that.

Ben Wyatt,"And two, you have to keep detailed financial records."
Roy Hibbert,Thank you!
Roy Hibbert,I've been trying to tell them that!
Detlef Schrempf,Waste of time.
Detlef Schrempf,They wouldn't know a nonemployee tax reportable expenditure request if it bit them in the ass.
Tom Haverford,"Hey guys, which two people here started their own company?"
Tom Haverford,'Cause I'm pretty sure it wasn't you two bozos.
Roy Hibbert,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you guys can swagger around all you want, but businesses need revenue, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Unless you start working on an actual plan, you're dead in a month."
Ben Wyatt,That's a fact.
Tom Haverford,"Ben, thanks for your time."
Tom Haverford,"But with all due respect, as far as business decisions go, I think we know what we're doing."
Tom Haverford,Don't forget to grab a free iPad on your way out.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,He didn't even have one.

Ann Perkins,Yup.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's can we take a break?"
Chris Traeger,I think that's a great idea.
Chris Traeger,"I think we almost have it, and I am very excited at that prospect."
Chris Traeger,I'll cancel my four o'clock and my five o'clock and my six o'clock appointments.
Ann Perkins,I cannot believe I dated him.
Ann Perkins,For a long time.
Ann Perkins,And he broke up with me!
Chris Traeger,Fat equals splat!
Chris Traeger,"As in, ""you're dead!"""
Chris Traeger,Is there something there?
Chris Traeger,No no.

Chris Traeger,But there's something there.
Chris Traeger,I'm feeling it let's go right away!
Chris Traeger,It's magic time!
Chris Traeger,"From the top, everybody."
Ann Perkins,There's no one else here.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, we're being attacked by Godzilla."
Leslie Knope,"And to beat Godzilla, we need Mothra."
Leslie Knope,No offense.
Tammy 2,None taken.
Tammy 2,I'm very flattered.
Tammy 2,Who's this?
Tammy 2,Who's this tall drink of water?
Andy Dwyer,Andy.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Andy."
Tammy 2,How's it hanging?
Leslie Knope,"Listen, we need you to break Ron from her spell."
Leslie Knope,"Can't you just move your butt around, or wear a dress made out of meat?"
Tammy 2,"Well I could do all those things and have, but that bitch is crazy."
Tammy 2,"When Ron left her and we got together, she threw acid on my foot."
April Ludgate,Eww!
Andy Dwyer,Could we take a peek at it?
Tammy 2,"Listen, Tammy One was my Sunday school teacher, too."
Tammy 2,"She can pinpoint your weaknesses, and then destroy you with just one word."
Tammy 2,And a jar of acid.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,I think I have an idea that could save Ron.
April Ludgate,"Andy, don't joke around."
Andy Dwyer,"I have ideas, too."
Ron's Mom, You were right to come get me.
Ron's Mom, My son Ronnie always had a weakness for those ladies.
Leslie Knope," Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope, Is this Ron?
Ron's Mom,Yup.
Ron's Mom, At the age of five.
Ron's Mom, He's standing next to the first chair he ever built.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, my God! There's a room full of just guns."
Leslie Knope, Why do you have so many guns?
Ron's Mom," This is America, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ron's Mom, Then I don't have to answer stupid questions while standing on my own property.
Ron's Mom, Let's go.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate," Well, it's definitely Ron's mom."
Ron's Mom, Tammy?
Tammy 1,Tammy.
Ron's Mom, Ronnie.
Ron Swanson, What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the Battle Royale.
Leslie Knope, Right here.
Leslie Knope, Right now.
Leslie Knope," Operation ""Soaring Falcon"" is in its final stages."
Ron's Mom, It's time to settle this.
Tammy 1, Ah.
Tammy 1, An old-fashioned prairie drink-off.
April Ludgate, What's in that jug? It smells like jet fuel.
Ron Swanson, That's Swanson family mash liquor.
Ron Swanson, Made from the finest corn ever grown on American soil.
Ron Swanson, Its only legal use is to strip varnish off of speedboats.
Ron's Mom," If you win, he's all yours."
Ron's Mom," And if I win, I bring him back to the farm for good."
Leslie Knope," Wait, what? That wasn't the deal."
Tammy 1, Pour it.
Tammy 1, I'm thirsty.
Leslie Knope," Pour me one, too, then."
Leslie Knope, Let me in here.
Leslie Knope," I'm gonna join you and if I win, Ron stays here with us."
Ron Swanson," Leslie, no, don't drink that."
Ron Swanson, We use it to burn warts off of the mules!
Leslie Knope,Poison! Ugh! I made a mistake.
Leslie Knope, I made a mistake.
Ann Perkins, How were we together for five months?
Extra,"Well, you know, it's possible you can just date a guy because of where you are in your life emotionally."
Ann Perkins," Yeah, I suppose you're right, John."
Chris Traeger," Ann Perkins, I hate to say this, but I have a stain on my shirt."
Chris Traeger," Which means that everything we shot so far is unusable, but let's use this as an opportunity to revisit the script."
Chris Traeger, Delivery guy.
Extra,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Diabetes! 
Ron's Mom,Had enough?
Tammy 1,Of this watered-down baby formula? Not even close.
Leslie Knope, Not meven clarse.
Leslie Knope, Marvin clods.
Leslie Knope, Glenn Close.
Ron Swanson," Leslie, you don't have to do this"
Leslie Knope,"Shh! Go to bed, Jimmy."
Leslie Knope, Wrah! I can't feel my face.
Leslie Knope, My face is numb.
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Chris Traeger,"And together, we can make a difference."
Chris Traeger, That's it.
Chris Traeger, I think we got it.
Chris Traeger, Do you think we got it?
Ann Perkins,"Yes! Yeah, we have it."
Ann Perkins, We had it seven hours ago.
Chris Traeger," Oh, Ann, I I know that I can be intense, but I'm only trying to be the best me that I can be."
Chris Traeger," I want to thank you for this opportunity and your patience, and your intelligence, and your insight."
Chris Traeger, You really are an amazing human being.
Ann Perkins, Thank you.
Ann Perkins," Oh, right-- that's why I dated him."
Ben Wyatt, Hey.
Tom Haverford, I wanted to apologize.
Tom Haverford, We brought in five accountants to look at e720 and they all said the same thing you did.
Tom Haverford," If we don't start making changes, we're gonna lose the company."
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt," Well, first thing you need to do: Get rid of four of those accountants."
Ben Wyatt, You don't need five accountants.
Tom Haverford," Again, good advice."
Tom Haverford, Here.
Ben Wyatt, You really you need to stop giving these away like candy.
Tom Haverford, I bought that one personally.
Tom Haverford, As a thank-you.
Tom Haverford, It's an iPad.
Leslie Knope,"  Everybody prance, now!   prance, prance, prance, prance, prance, prance "
Ron Swanson,She's had enough.
Ron Swanson, Call it off.
Tammy 1, That's not how it works.
Tammy 1, She's out.
April Ludgate, Wait.
April Ludgate, I'm subbing in.
Ron Swanson," April, no--that stuff will melt the shell off a garden snail."
April Ludgate, Whatever.
April Ludgate, I'm Puerto Rican.
April Ludgate, I can handle it.
April Ludgate,"oh, my God!"
Ron Swanson, This ends now.
Leslie Knope, Ah.
Ron Swanson," Mom, you're going back to the farm."
Ron Swanson," And you, you're going back to hell."
Tammy 1, Fine.
Tammy 1, I got what I came for anyway.
Tammy 1, I found your underground safe.
Tammy 1, I stole half your gold.
Ron Swanson, That's decoy gold.
Ron Swanson," You think I'd leave my gold in a locked safe buried underground, where anyone could find it? You don't know me at all."
Tammy 1," Yes, I do."
Tammy 1, I knew you the minute you were born.
Tammy 1, And I intend to be there the minute you die.
Leslie Knope," Ron, your family's weird."
Ben Wyatt," Literally, there's someone reading a magazine, and someone applying nail Polish."
Ben Wyatt, What's that what is she doing? She's just playing with an iPad.
Ben Wyatt," Tom told me that chair was $27,000."
Ben Wyatt, That chair that has a roof.
Ben Wyatt,there's someone over there in a deep sleep.
Ben Wyatt," She's probably being paid upwards of $100,000 a year."
Ben Wyatt, There's this video of a boat.
Ben Wyatt, Look at that thing.
Ben Wyatt, What is that? What are you supposed to do with that thing?

Derry Murbles,"Leslie, could one say that a book is nothing more than a painting of words, which are the notes on the tapestry of the greatest film ever sculpted?"

Tom Haverford,But Joan got an anonymous tip that there's a factual inaccuracy in your book.
Leslie Knope,That's impossible.
Leslie Knope,I checked every detail with the historical society.
Leslie Knope,Did she say what it was?
Tom Haverford,She won't tell me.
Tom Haverford,"I think she wants one of her big ""gotcha"" moments."
Leslie Knope,"Well, she's not gonna getch me."
Chris Traeger,I found no inaccuracies.
Leslie Knope,"Joan Callamezzo claims there is a mistake in my book, which there is not, and so now, she's trying to get me on a tiny technicality."

Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, call me as soon as you find the mistake that does not exist."
April Ludgate,Do you think there's actually a mistake in here?
Ron Swanson,I doubt it.

Ron Swanson,She's also not brief.

Ron Swanson,"It's just us, I hope."
April Ludgate,I wish.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys!"
Ann Perkins,Ready to do some factcheckin'?

Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I was on your show."
Joan Callamezzo,Nope.
Tom Haverford,I'm tryin' to find the words to describe this girl   without bein' disrespectful  Getting the book into Joan's book club will really help Leslie.
Tom Haverford,"But it'll also help my company, Entertainment 720."
Tom Haverford,"At the risk of bragging, one of the things I'm best at is riding coattails."
Tom Haverford,"Behind every successful man Is me, smiling and taking partial credit."
Tom Haverford,"Now, about Leslie's book."
Tom Haverford,Am I gonna be happy?
Joan Callamezzo,"We'll see, won't we?"

Leslie Knope,What?
Joan Callamezzo,Gotcha!
Joan Callamezzo,"And because you lied about it, we cannot make this a book club selection."
Leslie Knope,I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,I'd stake my reputation on it.
Leslie Knope,"I have to tell you, this feels like gotcha journalism."
Joan Callamezzo,In what way?
Leslie Knope,That way.
Leslie Knope,"You put ""gotcha"" on my face."
Joan Callamezzo,After the break: Where was Leslie Knope actually born?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee!
Joan Callamezzo,We will pull out the world map and speculate wildly.
Extra,Joan gotcha
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Not the gotcha dancers.
Extra,"betcha thought you'd   get away witcha   butcha got caught, didn't ya?"
Extra,Joan gotcha .
Chris Traeger,That was despicable!
Chris Traeger,I am horrified at her tactics.
Chris Traeger,"That said, the show was pretty lively."
Chris Traeger,Joan gotcha!
Tom Haverford,don't it hurtcha?
Chris Traeger,It's very catchy.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, Tom, you stay here, stay on Joan."
Leslie Knope,Get that sticker.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, Andy, we're gonna stay on schedule, and we're gonna do some damage control."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Everybody move!
Andy Dwyer,"Move, move, move!"
Andy Dwyer,This entire event is under federal jurisdiction.
Andy Dwyer,"Unless he's in trouble, there's only one man for the job."
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,You thought I was dead?
Andy Dwyer,So did the president's enemies.
Ann Perkins,Call if you need us.
Ann Perkins,Okay.

Ann Perkins,But Leslie wants us to be on ready alert one just in case something comes up.
Ron Swanson,Now I can get some real work done.
Ann Perkins,"You know, I think I'm just gonna hang out here with you guys, if that's cool."
April Ludgate,It's not.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,I could leave.
Ann Perkins,I could.
Ann Perkins,But I'm not going to.
Ann Perkins,"I will get my one minute of small talk, damn it."
Ann Perkins,"And it will be casual, and it will be amicable!"
Joan Callamezzo,Did Leslie leave?
Joan Callamezzo,We wanted her to sign the gotcha wall.
Tom Haverford,Joanie.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, now."
Tom Haverford,What was that?
Tom Haverford,I thought we were gonna get that sticker.
Joan Callamezzo,"Sorry, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,"But I am, first and foremost, a journalist."
Tom Haverford,Let us take you to lunch.
Tom Haverford,Okay?
Tom Haverford,We'll talk about the book.
Tom Haverford,And Whatever else may come up.
Joan Callamezzo,Let me go change into something more tantalizing.
Joan Callamezzo,All right?
Ben Wyatt,"So, what?"
Ben Wyatt,We're taking her to lunch now?
Tom Haverford,"Ben, Leslie hired my company to get her that sticker."
Tom Haverford,"You're the one that told me ""businesses"" need ""clients"" to get ""money."""
Ben Wyatt,I was the first one to tell you that?
Tom Haverford,Don't worry.
Tom Haverford,This is in the bag.
Tom Haverford,Joan's a married woman.
Tom Haverford,She wants what she can't have.
Tom Haverford,It's a game of cat and mouse.
Leslie Knope,Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope,"Our journey begins on page one, the preface."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Extra,"I think I speak on behalf of everyone in the entire world when I say, We need to know the truth about where you were born."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Well  Leslie?
Chris Traeger,Let me handle this.
Chris Traeger,Does it really matter?
Chris Traeger,"I mean, how many of you were actually born in Pawnee?"
Chris Traeger,Sure enough.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what you heard, ma'am, the truth is, I was born here."
Extra,"If you were so born here, then where's your birth certificate?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't carry my birth certificate around  with me"
Mel, Why?
Mel,Because you're hiding something?
Mel,You should go back where you came from.
Leslie Knope,I am back from where I came from!
Mel,That sentence was confusing!
Mel,You might as well be from China!
Mel,Tell us!
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous!
Mel,Is it?
Leslie Knope,I'm from here!
Andy Dwyer,"This crowd getting very hostile, Ms. Knope."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get you outta here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Back off!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, okay."
Chris Traeger,Thank you. Goodbye everbody.
Andy Dwyer,"Go, go, go!"
Joan Callamezzo,"When I was 18, Val Kilmer saw me at a mall and told me I should model."
Ben Wyatt,That never happened.
Tom Haverford,"So, Joan, how is married life treating you?"
Tom Haverford,Your husband still know he's the luckiest man in the world?
Joan Callamezzo,Santino and I are divorcing.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Joan Callamezzo,It's actually quite liberating.
Joan Callamezzo,I'm a woman with a strong sexual appetite.
Joan Callamezzo,"I'm like a caged peacock, yearning for the wind on her haunches."
Ben Wyatt,That's a powerful metaphor.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe we can get that book club sticker in order, and we can work on unlocking that peacock cage."
Joan Callamezzo,"Things have changed, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,Don't make any promises you can't keep.
Joan Callamezzo,"I'll have another drink, and so will this adorable hunk of caramel to my right."
Joan Callamezzo,"Drink up, Tom."
Joan Callamezzo,I'm gonna go powder my nose Amongst other things.
Joan Callamezzo,If you know what I mean.
Joan Callamezzo,Crap.
Ben Wyatt,Is she gonna powder her vagina?
Tom Haverford,"You gotta help me, man."
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Seems to be going the usual amount of gross.
Tom Haverford,"No, this is way different."
Tom Haverford,She's not married anymore.
Tom Haverford,"She had, like, five bottles of alcohol, she's calling me ""caramel."""
Tom Haverford,You've gotta throw some cold water on this situation.
Tom Haverford,Start talking about nerd stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, nerd culture is mainstream now."
Ben Wyatt,"So when you use the word ""nerd"" derogatorily, means you'the one that's out of the zeitgeist."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, that's perfect."
Tom Haverford,Just like that.
Tom Haverford,Be incredibly boring.
Ann Perkins,"Well, I've made a little progress."

April Ludgate,Alf.
Ann Perkins,And Nine seconds with Ron.
Ann Perkins,You're stranded on a desert island.
Ann Perkins,What is the one thing that you bring with you?
Ron Swanson,Silence.
Elizabeth Barnes,We did a flash poll.
Elizabeth Barnes,68% of Pawneeans now believe you're lying about where you were born.
Leslie Knope,13% believe I'm crazy eyed? What? Why?
Elizabeth Barnes,Honesty is important to voters.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, I can end this now."
Leslie Knope,Here's my birth certificate.
William Barnes,Mmhmm.
William Barnes,"Well, this just says ""Wamapoke County."""
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's the county Pawnee is in.
William Barnes,"Well, no."
William Barnes,This won't do it.
William Barnes,"See, you staked your reputation on this."
William Barnes,"So you need to go down to the county records office in Eagleton and get the original, long form certificate."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Don't make me go to Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Eagleton is the land of rich, snobby jerks."
Leslie Knope,There's a whole chapter about it in my book.
Leslie Knope,I could write a second book about Eagleton and how stupid it is.
Leslie Knope,"And I'd call it Eagleton: The land of rich, snobby jerks."
Alexis Pratchett,"Hello and welcome to the Wamapoke County Records Office, here in beautiful Eagleton."
Alexis Pratchett,My name is Alexis Pratchett.
Leslie Knope,"Take it down a notch, Alexis."
Leslie Knope,I need a copy of my birth certificate.
Alexis Pratchett,"Ooh, I'm sorry."
Alexis Pratchett,It takes three to eight weeks to receive a birth certificate.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Chris Traeger,"Hi, I'm Chris."
Chris Traeger,I was wondering if you might make an exception for me?
Alexis Pratchett,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Alexis Pratchett,No.
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,That usually works.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,"I hate this stupid town with all its stupid, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,I need that birth certificate.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, wait here."
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin is on the case.
Leslie Knope,Andy 
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,I can do this.
Andy Dwyer,Believe in me!
Andy Dwyer,That's broken.
Andy Dwyer,Hold on.
Andy Dwyer,Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,Real quick.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, spell your last name for me."
Joan Callamezzo,Let's hear it for the boys  Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,That was as long as it was loud.
Joan Callamezzo,"Take me home, dumpling."
Joan Callamezzo,It's beddy time.
Tom Haverford,Ah.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ben."
Tom Haverford,You like Star Trek.
Tom Haverford,Talk about that for a little bit.
Ben Wyatt,They're making a sequel I'm assuming with the same alternate timeline.
Ben Wyatt,"But if J.J. Abrams and company expect us to believe that it's Spock with the romantic tension with Uhura and not Kirk Well, let's just say, the message boards are goin' nuts."
Joan Callamezzo,I wanna take you both home and [bleep] bend you over and just [bleep].
Joan Callamezzo,At the same time.
Joan Callamezzo,Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,I'm leaving.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,We gotta get her home.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, I know your business is failing, but this just isn't worth it."
Tom Haverford,"It's not about the business anymore, man."
Tom Haverford,she's a disaster.
Tom Haverford,We gotta make sure she gets home safe.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa."
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's get her on the bed."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,One.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,Two.
Tom Haverford,Three.
Tom Haverford,"Let's go, bro."
Tom Haverford,"Say what you will about Joan, but she knows how to decorate a bedroom."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Where the hell am I?
Tom Haverford,I just wanna see how soft these sheets are.
Tom Haverford,One second.
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, no."
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Ah!
Tom Haverford,"Joan, we left you some water and aspirin by the bed!"
Tom Haverford,Bye!
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Andy Dwyer,I also got this dude's briefcase.
Andy Dwyer,It was just laying there.
Andy Dwyer,Kind of a panic move.
Chris Traeger,"I believed in you, buddy."
Chris Traeger,But you should put that back.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so."
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Barbara Knope, born January 18th, to Robert and Marlene Knope, in Eagleton, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,I'm from Eagleton!
Leslie Knope,Is it true mom?
Leslie Knope,Was I born in Eagleton?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Yes, it's true."
Leslie Knope,No!
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Pawnee hospital was overrun with raccoons at the time.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So we had to go to the next closest hospital.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'm sorry.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Did you expect me to give birth to you in an infested, disease filled room?"
Leslie Knope,"Mom, why didn't you tell me?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,You try telling that little girl she's not from Pawnee.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I certainly couldn't.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,So you were technically born in Eagleton.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,I care.
Leslie Knope,The people of Pawnee care.
Leslie Knope,I wrote on the cover of my book that I was born in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"I went on Pawnee today, and I called Joan a liar!"
Leslie Knope,I'm the liar.
Leslie Knope,I'm worse than a liar.
Leslie Knope,I'm an Eagletonian.
Ann Perkins,Morning.
Ann Perkins,Is Leslie here?
Ann Perkins,"Aw, man."
Ann Perkins,I am so tired.
Ann Perkins,I took a half shift at the hospital last night.
Ann Perkins,And I had this really weird patient.
April Ludgate,Weird how?
Ann Perkins,I probably shouldn't talk about it.
Ann Perkins,It's one of the grossest things I've ever seen.
Ron Swanson,Talk.
Ann Perkins,"Well, this guy came in."
Ann Perkins,"He got his hand stuck in a Pringles can, and he tried to cut himself out."
April Ludgate,Was there a lot of blood?
Ron Swanson,What kind of blade did he use?
Ann Perkins," Uh, three and a half inch?"
Ann Perkins, Serrated?
Ann Perkins, Buckets of blood.
Ann Perkins," He passed out over his arm, and slumped onto the floor."
April Ludgate, Did the bone show?
Ron Swanson," Very good question, April."
Ron Swanson, Answer her.
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, The bone showed.
Ann Perkins, Everyone in the universe loves a gross medical story.
Ann Perkins," Boom! I win! And so when I finally cleaned up the vomit, I found the toe."
April Ludgate, I forgot about the toe!
Ann Perkins,So did we! 
Ann Perkins,"Crazy, right? "
April Ludgate,That story's awesome!
Ron Swanson, Indeed.
Ron Swanson," Thank you for sharing, Jenny."
Ron Swanson, Ann was getting a little chummy.
Ron Swanson," When people get too chummy with me, I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don't really care about them."
April Ludgate, That's a genius move.
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
April Ludgate," You're welcome, Lester."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, I wonder who else was born in Eagleton.
Leslie Knope," Voldemort, probably."
Tom Haverford," Bad news, team."
Tom Haverford, Entertainment 720 was unable to get the sticker for Leslie's book.
Leslie Knope, The sticker is the least of my problems.
Leslie Knope," If I come clean about where I'm from, then my political career is over."
Ron Swanson, You don't have to tell them a damn thing.
Ron Swanson, The only thing the voters need to know about you is your name.
Ron Swanson," And even that, I go back and forth on."
Chris Traeger," I'm sorry, but I disagree."
Chris Traeger," Leslie, where you were born is a piece of trivia."
Chris Traeger, Where you're from That's what makes you who you are.
Chris Traeger, And you are from Pawnee.
Chris Traeger, You're more Pawnee than anyone I know.
Chris Traeger," So I say, tell them the truth, and trust that they're gonna respect you for it."
Ron Swanson," Damn it, he's right."
Ron Swanson, Well said.
Chris Traeger," Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson," You're welcome, Steve."
Tom Haverford, Joan.
Tom Haverford, Thanks so much for having Leslie back on the program.
Joan Callamezzo," Well, thank you for getting me home last night."
Joan Callamezzo," I wasn't, uh, feeling very well."
Joan Callamezzo, Because of some bad seafood that I ate.
Ben Wyatt," Yes, that's probably what it was."
Leslie Knope, I'd like to apologize to those that I've misled.
Leslie Knope," I thought I was telling the truth, but, sadly, I was born in Eagleton."
Joan Callamezzo," What? Well, that is worse than I ever could have hoped for."
Leslie Knope," I learned something, Joan."
Leslie Knope, It's not where you're born.
Leslie Knope, It's where you're from.
Leslie Knope," When I was nine years old, I broke my arm."
Leslie Knope, Sledding on that giant hill behind Kernston's rubber nipple factory.
Leslie Knope," You know, ""nipple hill""."
Joan Callamezzo,Of course.
Leslie Knope,It gets very slippery there.
Joan Callamezzo,I know that.
Leslie Knope, Especially when it's wet.
Joan Callamezzo,Yes.
Leslie Knope," And, Jim."
Leslie Knope, Jim Kabernick.
Leslie Knope, I know Jim.
Leslie Knope," Jim and I have gone to school together since we were, like, three years old."
Jim Kabernick," Yes, that's true."
Leslie Knope, Do you remember when you peed your pants in second grade
Jim Kabernick, Why why did you bring that up? I said yes.
Leslie Knope," You stuck your underwear in your drawer, and you got really embarrassed, and then the teacher came over and pulled them out."
Leslie Knope," And everybody called you ""the gerbil"" because you always smelled like soiled wood chips?"
Jim Kabernick,"Leslie, for God's sake, we're on TV."
Leslie Knope, The point is you can't choose where you were born.
Leslie Knope, But you can choose where you live.
Leslie Knope, I love this town.
Leslie Knope, I always have.
Leslie Knope, I always will.
Leslie Knope, And that's why I wrote a book about it.
Leslie Knope, And that's why I'm running for City Council.
Leslie Knope," Look, I'm not crazy."
Leslie Knope," I know Pawnee isn't Paris, or London, or Chicago."
Leslie Knope, But it's a great place to live.
Leslie Knope, And work.
Leslie Knope, And serving the goofballs in this town is an honor and a privilege.
Leslie Knope," And, yes, every town claims its diner's waffles are the best in the world, but somewhere, in some town, there really are the best waffles in the world."
Leslie Knope," So delicious, and rich, and golden brown that anyone who tasted them would decide never to leave that town."
Leslie Knope," Somewhere, those waffles exist."
Leslie Knope, Why can't it be here?
Leslie Knope,Joan put us in her book club.
Leslie Knope, Although I could do without this.
Jerry Gergich, Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,Here's the thing.
Jerry Gergich, I've been all over the State.
Jerry Gergich," Indianapolis, Bloomington, Lafayette, Muncie, Gary All the places you mention in the book."
Jerry Gergich, And I interviewed all the people you mentioned.
Jerry Gergich," And so far, there is not one incorrect fact."
Jerry Gergich," So now I'm going to head to the house, say hey to Gayle, wish my daughter a happy belated birthday It was yesterday And then I'm gonna head back out and hit all the towns in the southeast."
Jerry Gergich, But is there anything I should know? Any new info?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope, You're doing great.
Leslie Knope, Godspeed.
Jerry Gergich,Doing what I can.
Jerry Gergich,"Yep! Hey, Ron."
Jerry Gergich," Gotta go, Donna."
Jerry Gergich, Can't talk.
Leslie Knope, He just seemed so happy.
Donna Meagle, I didn't say anything.

Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Ron Swanson,Wildeness weekend is upon us.
Ron Swanson,There will be no video games.
Ron Swanson,There will be no Internet pads.
Ron Swanson,This weekend you have two parents: Me and Mother Nature.
Andy Dwyer,And I am Mother Nature's brother: Brother nature.
Andy Dwyer,But you can call me Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Or brother nature.
Andy Dwyer,Your call.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Brother nature.
Ron Swanson,For the last three years I have served as troop leader of the Pawnee Rangers.
Ron Swanson,This is our handbook.
Ron Swanson,I wrote the whole thing myself.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time to give out the badges."
Leslie Knope,"Um, let's see."
Leslie Knope,"Emily, you get the badge for most community service."
Leslie Knope,"To Casey, the best penguin blog badge."
Leslie Knope," To Abigail, flyest hairstyle."
Leslie Knope,And Ann gets the badge for second flyest hairstyle.
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,I wasn't competing for that.
Leslie Knope,I'll say.
Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, a plucky fifthgrader wanted to join the Pawnee Rangers, but their executive council said what obnoxious jerks always say."
Leslie Knope,"""No."""
Leslie Knope,"""This is males only."""
Leslie Knope,"""Go start your own club."""
Leslie Knope,She couldn't.
Leslie Knope,So I did.
Leslie Knope,"We're called the Pawnee Goddesses, and we're freaking awesome."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, whose club do you think is better, yours or mine?"
Leslie Knope,The answer is mine.
Leslie Knope,Say mine is better.
Ron Swanson,It's not a competition.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, but it is."
Leslie Knope,Your club made it a competition when they kept girls out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my stars."
Leslie Knope,I'm just a little lady.
Leslie Knope,My fragile constitution cannot handle the fearsome outdoors.
Ron Swanson,"I have no problem with strong women, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Who's Leslie?
Leslie Knope,"My name is Annabelle Vandergraf, and, y'all, I just fall to pieces when the sun shines on my haired."
Ron Swanson,"However, the Pawnee Rangers were founded because some boys want to go out into nature and learn traditional survival skills without being distracted by girls."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my awesome goddesses don't want to be distracted by losers."
Leslie Knope,"Say my club is better, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,My club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Say it's better.
Leslie Knope,Say my club is better.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,Give it up.
Leslie Knope,Whose club is better?
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Leslie Knope,You know it.
Leslie Knope,Say it.
Ron Swanson,"On principle, I never say anything that another person is obviously trying to get me to say."
Ron Swanson,"My first wedding ceremony took two hours, because after the priest said ""Repeat after me"" I fell silent."
Ben Wyatt,"I've been auditing the budget, and I noticed you're way behind on your paperwork."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Jerry, you haven't filled out a PC10 form in two and a half years."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, jeez, I'm sorry."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, we kinda do our paperwork at our own speed."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I kinda need you to do it at my speed."
Donna Meagle,"Fine, I'll do them."
Donna Meagle,What is wrong with you today?
Donna Meagle,Did they cancel Game of Thrones?
Ben Wyatt,"Nothing is wrong, just do your job."
Ben Wyatt,And they would never cancel Game of Thrones.
Ben Wyatt,It's a crossover hit.
Ben Wyatt,It's not just for fantasy enthusiasts.
Ben Wyatt,They're telling human stories in a fantasy world.
Ben Wyatt,"Fill out the forms, please."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I used to have one really good reason for staying in Pawnee.
Ben Wyatt,"But now, I'm not sure what's keeping me here."
Ben Wyatt,"Although, I am just two sandwiches away from a free meatball sub."
Ben Wyatt,This is expired.
Ron Swanson,"Rangers, as a reward for coming on this trip, I have gotten you each two gifts."
Ron Swanson,Go ahead.
Ron Swanson,Open 'em.
Darren,What is this?
Ron Swanson,"That is a canvas sheet, the most versatile object known to man."
Ron Swanson,"It can be used to make tents, backpacks, shoes, stretchers, sails, tarpaulins, and I suppose, in the most dire of circumstances, it can be a surface on which to make ""art."""
Extra,What's the second gift?
Ron Swanson,The second gift is the box itself.
Ron Swanson,You have 10 minutes to assemble a shelter using only your two gifts.
Ron Swanson,Go.
Leslie Knope,Ladies!
Leslie Knope,The goddess cabin has never looked better.
Leslie Knope,This year's cabin refurbishment badge is going to be hotly contested.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so what did everybody make for their loosely structured craft time?"
Leslie Knope,Lauren?
Lauren,"I made a ""Gertrude Stein."""
Leslie Knope,Amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Lauren, that's so good!"
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't want to follow that.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,Um I was making some cornhusk dolls for everyone but they kinda turned out wrong so they look like monsters.
Ann Perkins,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,I'm just gonna put that over there.
Ann Perkins,In the fire.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ann's keeping us warm."
Leslie Knope,And that's important.
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,What was your craft?
April Ludgate,I drew something on my arm.
April Ludgate,It's a pioneer girl watching her grandmother get trampled by a buffalo.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,This right here's all the blood coming out her face.
DJ Bluntz,"DJ Bluntz is in the building, here to announce that Tom Haverford is in the building."
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"1 2, 1 2!"

Tom Haverford, The best day of the year .
Donna Meagle,I got a question.
Tom Haverford,Mmhmm?
Donna Meagle,What do you think about inviting Ben to come along with us today?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Noo!
Tom Haverford,This is our thing.
Donna Meagle,But he really seems like he could use a day off.
Donna Meagle,He's like a skinny little rubber band that's about to snap in half.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,He doesn't know how to relax.
Tom Haverford,"Donna, you and I are relaxation professionals."
Tom Haverford,There's no way Ben can slow down enough to keep up with us.
Tom Haverford,"My Nubian princess, this is our holy day."
Tom Haverford,It's the one day a year I allow myself to be selfish.
Jerry Gergich,"Ooh, cupcakes."
Tom Haverford,"Those are all for me, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"This homemade bulgogi is so delicious, Kayla."
Leslie Knope,This is the best Korean food I've ever had.
Leslie Knope,I would say it's almost as good as lukewarm beans from a can.
Leslie Knope,"Right, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm trying to teach my boys about rationing food, and your selfindulgent ethnic food court isn't helping."
Leslie Knope,"Goddesses, let's go over our schedule for this afternoon."
Leslie Knope,"We have hiking, and then capture the flag, and then a puppet show about the Bill of Rights set to ""Party in the USA"" by Miley Cyrus, and then we have lasso training, and a s'moresoff."
Darren," So what's on our schedule, Mr. Swanson?"
Ron Swanson,We have one activity planned: Not getting killed.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, everybody must be at  Rangers weekend."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I actually was a ranger for 12 years"
Chris Traeger,That's wonderful.
Chris Traeger,Maybe you should take the day off.
Chris Traeger,"You know, rest is very important."
Chris Traeger,Did you know that lab rats who are deprived of rest grow tumors all over their bodies?
Chris Traeger,You should Google it.
Chris Traeger,It's horrifying.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, thank you."
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I'm gonna I'm gonna go have lunch with my daughter!"
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, if you wanted, you know, you should join us for lunch."
Jerry Gergich,"My daughter, she's really sweet."
Chris Traeger,"I would love to, Jerry, but I'm afraid that I am busy."
Chris Traeger,I have got to run.
Chris Traeger,Google those rat tumors!
Donna Meagle,Treat yourself 2011 
Tom Haverford,Treat yourself 2011 
Donna Meagle,"Oh, lord."
Donna Meagle,Is he eating soup?
Donna Meagle,On a bench?
Donna Meagle,Alone?
Donna Meagle,Tom.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Donna Meagle,"Come on, rubber band."
Donna Meagle,Come with us.

Ben Wyatt,What are you
Donna Meagle,No arguing.
Donna Meagle,And no soup in the Benz.
Donna Meagle,Get in.
Ben Wyatt,Wha?

Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,"Great pillow fight, girls."
Leslie Knope,That was one of our best ones yet.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Now it's time for awards.
Leslie Knope,Lulu gets the golden pillow.
Leslie Knope,And the silver pillow goes to Janie.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, what is it?"
Darren,"Ms. Knope, I don't like the  Rangers anymore."
Darren,I want to become a Pawnee Goddess.
Leslie Knope,I did it!
Leslie Knope,My club is officially the best club.
Leslie Knope,"I would give myself a merit badge that says ""Best Club Founder,"" but I don't have one, so I'm going to give myself ""Prettiest eyes"" as a placeholder."
Leslie Knope,"I secretly always wanted this badge, so it works out great."
Ron Swanson,You were defecting?
Darren,"I like you, Mr. Swanson, it's just All we do is sit in silence and eat beans."
Ron Swanson,Those beans were a reward.
Leslie Knope,"Well, see, the thing is this club is for girls only."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe you should start your own club, for boys."
Ron Swanson,Get back to your canvas box.
Ron Swanson,We'll discuss this no further.
Ron Swanson,And I'll thank you to keep the ruckus down so my boys can focus on solitude.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Darren."
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"So, treat yourself day is just a day where you go to the spa and then the mall?"
Tom Haverford,I knew you wouldn't get it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm a relaxation novice."
Ben Wyatt,Give me some guidance.
Tom Haverford,"Listen to me, Bento box, the point of this is to pamper yourself."
Tom Haverford,"Just relax, man."
Ben Wyatt,I can't.
Ben Wyatt,Something about the sound of harps that makes me nervous.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,"Hi, Donna."
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,Relaxation lesson number one: Acupuncture.
Donna Meagle,"It's great for your back, and your rear."
Donna Meagle,"Needles in your face, pleasure in your base."
Millicent Gergich,I know.
Jerry Gergich,That's my boss.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Chris."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, I would like you to meet my daughter, Millicent."
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, great job."
Chris Traeger,I'm your dad's boss.
Chris Traeger,And his much younger friend.
Millicent Gergich,Pleasure to meet you.
Jerry Gergich,Isn't she beautiful?
Jerry Gergich,"I say she looks like my wife, Gayle, and Gayle agrees."
Jerry Gergich,"So, anyway, we were gonna go to lunch, so"
Chris Traeger,I retroactively accept your original offer.
Chris Traeger,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, I just wanted to thank you for not cheering when I sent Darren away."
Extra,"Ms. Knope, wasn't Darren just asking for the same equality that you and the goddesses wanted five years ago?"
Leslie Knope,"In a sense, but it's a little bit more complicated than "
Extra,Wasn't your answer the very same thing that the ranger council said to you?
Extra,"""Stick to your own kind""?"
Ann Perkins,Who wants homemade peanut brittle?
Extra,"Ms. Perkins, please, we're in the middle of a debate."
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, goddesses."
Leslie Knope,We just struck a huge blow for equality by proving that we were better than them.
Lauren,I disagree.
Lauren,What about a public forum?
Lauren,You always say that there's no better solution for a hotbutton issue than a good old fashioned public forum.
Leslie Knope,"Great idea, Lauren."
Lauren,What was that?
Leslie Knope,"I said, ""great idea, Lauren."""
Leslie Knope,I've taught them too well.
Leslie Knope,I've created a mob of little Leslie Knope monsters.
Leslie Knope,I'm so proud.
Leslie Knope,And a little annoyed.
Leslie Knope,But mostly proud.
Leslie Knope,70 30.
Extra,Just relax and don't move.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Ah This is the most stressed out I've ever been in my life.
Tom Haverford,"Ben, listen."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna talk to you about things you like to take your mind off the needles, okay?"
Tom Haverford,Accounting.
Tom Haverford,Trigonometry.
Tom Haverford,"Stamps, probably."
Ben Wyatt,More of a rare coins guy.
Ben Wyatt,Help me.
Ben Wyatt,Help me!
Chris Traeger,There is nothing that I like more than running for charity.
Millicent Gergich,"You know, last summer I did a 50 mile bike ride  for the red cross."
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, she did."
Chris Traeger,"Millicent Gergich, biking for charity is literally one of my interests on Facebook."
Chris Traeger, I can't believe how alike we are.
Millicent Gergich,"I know, it's like we're literally the same person."
Chris Traeger, We are having a moment.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to wonder weekend's firstever public forum.
Leslie Knope,Our topic today?
Leslie Knope,"Should the amazing goddesses take pity on the once powerful Pawnee Rangers, and let them into our clearly superior organization?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your opening statement."
Ron Swanson,"This forum, like all public forums, is a waste of time."
Ron Swanson,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Powerful stuff.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Let's open up the floor to debate.
Leslie Knope,"Who yes, Abigail."
Abigail,Isn't it like Brown vs. The Board of Education?
Abigail,Separate but equal is never really equal.
Abigail,We should let the boys in.
Leslie Knope,"Mmm, interesting."
Leslie Knope,Casey?
Casey,I disagree.
Casey,I think there's a benefit to educating the genders separately.
Leslie Knope,I see where you're coming from.
Leslie Knope,Let's hear from a ranger.
Leslie Knope,Anyone?
Leslie Knope,Darren?
Darren,It's cold and dirty out here.
Darren,And you guys have candy.
Darren,I want the candy.
Leslie Knope,"The goddesses are making some well informed statements, but the most compelling point is from Darren, about the candy."
Leslie Knope,We have amazing candy in there.
Tom Haverford,"Welcome to Nirvana, the Plaza at Eagleton."
Tom Haverford,"There's a reflecting pool out back, there's an oldtimey train that runs through the mall, and three Burberrys."
Tom Haverford,"If you tell your friend, ""hey, meet me at Burberry,"" they gotta specify which one."
Donna Meagle,Let's hit it.
Donna Meagle,"I really want this dress, and I like this crystal beetle, but it's expensive and there's no use for it."
Tom Haverford,Donna Meagle?
Tom Haverford,Treat yourself.
Tom Haverford,"Velvet slippies, cashmere socks, velvet pants, cashmere turtle."
Tom Haverford,I'm a cashmere velvet candy cane.
Donna Meagle,Treat yourself.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this is insane."
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, a word?"
Jerry Gergich,Of course.
Chris Traeger,I had an amazing lunch.
Chris Traeger,I've already passed the kale salad I had.
Chris Traeger,"But, even better?"
Chris Traeger,Your daughter was delightful company.
Chris Traeger,"Now, I don't want to put you in an awkward position, but"
Jerry Gergich,You would like to date my daughter.
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Chris Traeger,But you are her father.
Chris Traeger,And that is a sacred thing.
Chris Traeger,"I would like to spend the next 2 to 4 days with you so you can get to know me better, to find out if I'm the kind of person who's good enough for your daughter."
Chris Traeger,"Then, you can come with us on our first 3 to 6 dates"
Jerry Gergich,"Chris, I appreciate the gesture, it's very nice, but, Milly, she's a grown woman, and of course I trust her."
Jerry Gergich,And I trust you.
Chris Traeger,Jerry.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,"Boys, I'm trying to teach you something about nature and self reliance."
Ron Swanson,Nothing beats hard work and determination.
Extra,Is this the Pawnee goddesses?
Extra,I've got the puppies you ordered.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,The puppies for the puppy party that we're having in our cabin?
Leslie Knope,Those puppies?
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Noo!
Tom Haverford,"Man, did you buy anything for yourself today?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I got this pack of socks."
Tom Haverford,Plain white socks?
Tom Haverford,That's not a treat!
Tom Haverford,Donna!
Tom Haverford,Get me away from him.
Donna Meagle,Look.
Donna Meagle,Maybe this is our version of treat yourself day and he needs to do his version.
Tom Haverford,What are you talking about?
Donna Meagle,"Wyatt, if you could blow big money on one thing not sock money what would it be?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,This is a whole new level of nerd.
Ben Wyatt,You're right.
Ben Wyatt,This is ridiculous.
Ben Wyatt,What am I doing?
Tom Haverford,Wait.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no, no."
Tom Haverford,"I mean that in a good way, Ben."

Ben Wyatt,Because I won't be able to sleep.
Ben Wyatt,Because of the party.
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Ben Wyatt,So All right.
Ben Wyatt,My family is very nonconfrontational.
Ben Wyatt,My parents' method of problem solving is to kind of keep everything bottled up and just subtly hint at what's bothering them.
Ben Wyatt,"And after 36 years, they are still divorced."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is not what I pictured at all."
Leslie Knope,This looks like a party for Entertainment 720.
Leslie Knope,Is Entertainment 720 running for office?
Tom Haverford,It's a small business.
Tom Haverford,You're trying to show people you have a good relationship with small businesses.
Tom Haverford,"Now the party, that's all about you, Boo."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then shouldn't my face be on these rugs?"
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, no."
Tom Haverford,It's always been a dream of mine to be a rug.

Chris Traeger,"Oh, good, I'll text her."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you can text without looking at your phone?"
Chris Traeger,I think it's rude not to maintain eye contact with people that I'm talking to.
Chris Traeger,That's from me.
Jerry Gergich,Wow!
Jerry Gergich,that's amazing.
Chris Traeger,High five.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.

Andy Dwyer,What else do they want me to do?
Ron Swanson,There's an exposed wire above the bathtub as well.

Tanya,"Mm, I've never seen you buy a salad at Sue's Salads."
Leslie Knope,"That's 'cause I don't hate myself, Tanya."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be chasing your vote, but I stand behind my decision to avoid salad and other disgusting things."
Leslie Knope,And I think I have a lot of support in the community for that.
Leslie Knope,"Despite the fact that this seems like a party for Tom's face, uh, I think it's going pretty well."
Leslie Knope,"When in doubt, in Pawnee, slam salad."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just especially thankful that you could come, Mr. President."
Martin Kernston,Martin.
Leslie Knope,Martin.
Martin Kernston,"You were responsible for the Harvest Festival, right?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Yes.

Leslie Knope,I worked very hard on that event.
Leslie Knope,I'm just.
Leslie Knope,Bureaucrats s aren't used to bragging about themselves.

Tom Haverford,"Martin, Tom Haverford I threw this shindig "
Leslie Knope,"Tom, tell Martin how hard I worked on  the Harvest Festival."
Tom Haverford,It was incredible.
Tom Haverford,A lot of people say the Harvest Festival is what launched Entertainment 720.
Leslie Knope,No one says that.
Tom Haverford,I just said it.
Tom Haverford,"My company, Entertainment 720, has an amazing business opportunity for Kernston's."
Tom Haverford,Mind if I steal you away for a few seconds?
Tom Haverford,Give you the 'tails?
Martin Kernston,The 'tails?
Tom Haverford,The details.
Tom Haverford,"Most people would probably say ""the deets."""
Tom Haverford,"I say ""the 'tails."""
Tom Haverford,Just one example of innovation.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't like to throw around the word ""butthead"" too often."
Leslie Knope,"If you call everybody a butthead, then it kind of loses its impact."
Leslie Knope,But I can say without hesitation that Tom is being a real dick.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,You stole the nipple king.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks a lot, traitor."
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, I just needed to ask him about this one thing, but we're all good now."
Tom Haverford,what if I just introduce you for your speech?
Leslie Knope,I have a better idea.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go over to one of your rugs and sit on your own face?
Leslie Knope,"I don't need your ""help"" anymore."
Extra,Hi there.
Extra,Is there a project you're working on?
Ron Swanson,I know more than you.
Extra,All right.
Ron Swanson,"When April and Andy married, I didn't get them a wedding present."
Ron Swanson,"In my experience, wedding presents are nothing more than kindling on a divorce bonfire."
Ron Swanson,But I think I found a way I can really help them make a home.
Ron Swanson,"You, beanbag, come with me."
Ann Perkins,I'm an eggplant.
Ron Swanson,I don't care.

Andy Dwyer,You should go wear that.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna put on a costume because I'm not really attending this party That's at my house."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, listen, if you're mad about something,  you should just "

Tom Haverford, That's who that was?
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,That is impressive.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, we're not gonna waste any more of your time."

Andy Dwyer,We need to deal with what's bothering you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, please, come into my room."
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,You're angry at me and you're not talking about it.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm gonna beat you up until you do, because I'm mature."
Ben Wyatt,What are you Stop it.
Andy Dwyer,I grew up with five brothers and we fought.
Andy Dwyer,"Using the Dwyer method, which was yelling, wrestling, crying, followed by lots of hugs."
Andy Dwyer,"And then more wrestling, but the fun kind, and then crying when the fun kind of wrestling got out of hand."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, can you let me go?"
Andy Dwyer,Not 'til you tell me what's wrong.
Leslie Knope,"Um, Mr. President."
Leslie Knope,I just want to apologize for the actions of that little weasel.
Martin Kernston,"Leslie, I'm a frugal man."
Martin Kernston,I don't like extravagance or showmanship.
Martin Kernston,That's why I cut my own hair.
Martin Kernston,And it's what's made me a successful businessman.
Martin Kernston,"So if Entertainment 720 is the kind of business you trust, I'm afraid you and I don't share the same values."
Leslie Knope,"There you are, you little bastard."
Leslie Knope,Get out of there right now.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, can you do me a favor and just let me sit here?"
Leslie Knope,"Tom, get out of your stupid limousine hot tub right now, or we are no longer friends."
Tom Haverford,I'm not getting out.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, then I'm getting in."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, get away from me."
Leslie Knope,You know what you are?
Leslie Knope,"You're a selfish little punk, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just because you want something doesn't mean that everybody has to bow to listen to me!
Leslie Knope,You didn't even let me have my one night.
Leslie Knope,Look at me!
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face.
Leslie Knope,Look at me.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to see your face!
Leslie Knope,I've been looking at your face all night.
Leslie Knope,God!
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with you?
Tom Haverford,My company's bankrupt.
Tom Haverford,Okay?
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 is dead.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Ron Swanson,Excuse us.
Ron Swanson,"Nice form, son."
Ron Swanson,Make sure you keep a firm pressure on the cranium.
Andy Dwyer,On the cranium?
Ron Swanson,Listen up!
Ron Swanson,I have to turn off the power for one minute.
Ann Perkins,"We're gonna go dark, people."
Ann Perkins,"Bear with us, okay?"
Ann Perkins,We gotta switch off the main fuse hose.
Ron Swanson,It's just a fuse.
Ann Perkins,"It's just a fuse, People."
Ann Perkins,Just a fuse.
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe we should get out of this hot tub."
Tom Haverford,I'm too sad to get out.
Tom Haverford,And I'm all pruney.
Leslie Knope,What happened?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,"I guess I just didn't moisturize enough this morning, and I've been laying around"
Leslie Knope,"With the company, Tom."
Tom Haverford,We're hemorrhaging cash ever since we opened.
Tom Haverford,They say you've got to spend money to make money.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I don't know where we went wrong."
Tom Haverford,We spent all of our money.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,You know what you need?
Leslie Knope,Some good oldfashioned comfort food.
Tom Haverford,Where are we gonna get Albacore tuna with crispy onions at this hour?
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ron Swanson,Looks like you've got the handle on that torque wrench.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, well, the flange was a little warped."
Ann Perkins,So I just goosed it with a triple three bolt smack.
Ron Swanson,That was nonsense.
Ann Perkins,"I know, but it's so fun to talk like that."
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,Keep this.
Ron Swanson,You earned it.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,I need to get more chips.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going.
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, walk."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,This is a pacifist protest.
Ben Wyatt,Had enough?
Ben Wyatt,You need to let go of me.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, get it."
Andy Dwyer,That's good.
Andy Dwyer,There we go.
Ben Wyatt,Let go of me.

Ben Wyatt,What?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,I wanted to shock you into expressing your anger.
Andy Dwyer,And that way !
Andy Dwyer,My nose is broken.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,I gotta go to the hospital.
April Ludgate,"Andy, come on."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Didn't it feel good?
April Ludgate,Come here.
Andy Dwyer,Yup!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I thought you guys were doing great."
Leslie Knope,I remember trying to hire you once.
Leslie Knope,And you said you were all booked up.
Tom Haverford,That was a business tactic.
Tom Haverford,"For the first two weeks, we told everyone we were booked solid to make people want us more."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, that's the stupidest idea I've ever heard."
Tom Haverford," Well, hindsight is 20/20."
Leslie Knope, Kind of seems like regular sight should have caught that one.
Leslie Knope," Also, your logo, it's the worst logo I've ever seen."
Leslie Knope, It doesn't make any sense.
Leslie Knope, It's gibberish.
Tom Haverford, We made some mistakes.
Tom Haverford, Tonight was my last chance to land a big client.
Tom Haverford, And I failed again.
Tom Haverford," God, it's so embarrassing."
Leslie Knope," Oh, hey, Tom, you're a smart guy."
Leslie Knope, And charming.
Leslie Knope, Occasionally.
Leslie Knope, You're gonna have a lot more good ideas.
Tom Haverford, Thanks.
Tom Haverford, Sorry I screwed up your campaign thing.
Tom Haverford, I really wanted to do a good job.
Tom Haverford, I made you this amazing video biography.
Leslie Knope, Of my life?
Tom Haverford, It's back at the office.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's eat and go."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Leslie Knope, Didn't I ask for whipped cream on this?
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Ben Wyatt," Ugh, does it hurt?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you broke my nose, so"
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,But I don't even care.
Andy Dwyer," Just get it all out there, man."
Andy Dwyer, Go.
Ben Wyatt, All right maybe you have to start thinking about how how your actions affect me.
Ben Wyatt," Like, tell me about stuff happening in the house."
Ben Wyatt, Stop referring to my bedroom as a common space.
Ben Wyatt, Stop using my comforter for your pillow forts.
Ben Wyatt, Just respect me.
Andy Dwyer, Absolutely.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yep.
Andy Dwyer," And in return, I'll only ask for one thing, which is for you to pay for studio recording time for my band to do our new album."
Andy Dwyer," It's gonna be about 5,600 bucks."
Andy Dwyer, Deal?
Ben Wyatt, That's not gonna happen.
Nurse, Here's something for the pain and some ice packs.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Nurse,You his friend?
Andy Dwyer,"Him? Hell, no."
Andy Dwyer, We're brothers.
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
April Ludgate, Hey.
Andy Dwyer,Hi.
April Ludgate, We should go.
April Ludgate, I'm blocking an ambulance.
April Ludgate," Ew, if your nose is all weird after this, I'm totally gonna divorce you."
Andy Dwyer," Whatever, I'm gonna divorce you first for wearing my favorite hoodie."
April Ludgate, Is everything cool?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it is."
April Ludgate,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer, We just can't use Ben's comforters anymore for our pillow forts.
April Ludgate," Ugh, what are we gonna have sex on?"
Tom Haverford,The year was 1975.
Tom Haverford, It was a time of trouble.
Tom Haverford," Watergate, Vietnam, Peter Gabriel leaves Genesis."
Tom Haverford," But then, a ray of hope Leslie Barbara Knope was born on January 18, 1975."
Tom Haverford, And she has been a loyal patron of its businesses ever since.
Leslie Knope," Tom Haverford is a selfish, unctuous, sleazy, self-promoting, good-hearted, secretly kind and wonderful tiny little person."
Leslie Knope, He went to Kernston's office and basically begged him to meet with me again.
Leslie Knope, I think he technically might have bribed him.
Leslie Knope," But hey, you know, whatever works."
Leslie Knope," It was Mary Pickford who once said, ""This thing we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down."""
Leslie Knope,Tom won't be down for long.
Tom Haverford, Her name is Leslie Knope.
Tom Haverford, And I'm gonna vote for her.
Tom Haverford," And if Lil' Sebastian were still alive, he'd surely vote for her."
Tom Haverford, And I reckon you should too.
Tom Haverford," Did ya like it? It's pretty great, right? Worked really hard on it."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, I loved it."
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna watch it every day for the rest of my life.
Leslie Knope," And when I die, I'm gonna project it on my tombstone."
Chris Traeger, I had an amazing time at that party.
Chris Traeger," And in the case of the woman who's stolen my heart, the culprit was Millicent Gergich."
Millicent Gergich, You should look into actual detective work.
Chris Traeger, I will.
Chris Traeger," And, Jerry, I've decided to take your daughter home."
Chris Traeger, And we may be having intercourse.
Jerry Gergich," Please, you've got to stop saying things like that to me."
Chris Traeger," You've got it, man."
Millicent Gergich," Bye, dad."
Millicent Gergich, Everything okay?
Chris Traeger, I can't find my car keys.
April Ludgate," Solve this mystery, genius."

Andy Dwyer,"Miss Leslie Knope, I present to you Herb Scaifer."
Leslie Knope,"Again, Andy, you don't need to bow."
Andy Dwyer,"As you wish, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Herb, what can I do you for?"
Herb Scaifer,"Well, please prepare yourself."
Herb Scaifer,I have terrible news.
Leslie Knope,You do?
Herb Scaifer,The world is going to end tomorrow at dawn.
Leslie Knope,Aw nuts.
Leslie Knope,You sure it's tomorrow?
Herb Scaifer,Afraid so.
Herb Scaifer,Right at dawn.
Herb Scaifer,"The entire planet, gone."
Leslie Knope,"Not giving me much notice Herb, let me see what I can do."
Leslie Knope,"For a while in the 1970s, our town was run by a freaky cult."
Leslie Knope,And every few years the remaining members predicted the world's gonna end.
Leslie Knope,And they have an allnight vigil in the park.
Leslie Knope,It's super annoying.
Leslie Knope,"Turns out when you think the world's ending, you don't aim so carefully in the portapotties."
Leslie Knope,"Tonight the follower of Reasonablism, will be joining together to await the return of Zorp."
Leslie Knope,The giant lizard God who will destoy the Earth with his cleansing fire of judgment.
Leslie Knope,"Also, light refreshments will be served."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, last year, they had pizza."
Jerry Gergich,Are they going to get pizza again?
Leslie Knope,"It says they've got turkey sandwiches, and the nectar of a thousand sorrows."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that is so good."
Andy Dwyer,It's root beer and red wine.
Andy Dwyer,I went to one meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, I'm going to miss you, enormous chair."
Extra,You really sat in this thing?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I loved it. Felt like a tiny king."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tcups, we did it baby."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We built a company from the ground up.
Tom Haverford,And then we ran it back into the ground.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Well the important thing to remember, is that it was a masive success."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Remy Martin?
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 is dead.
Tom Haverford,It's up in company heaven.
Tom Haverford,Along with pets.com
Tom Haverford,Blockbuster and askjeeves.
Tom Haverford,My company is no better than a company where you ask a fake butler to Google things for you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hello!
Tom Haverford,"So it looks like we'll each end up with about 5,000 dollars apiece."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Stop.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We get five g's each?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's amazing!
Tom Haverford,You started out with 450000.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You remember when DJ Bluntz made us our own personal entrance beats?
Tom Haverford,Remember the opening night party when you danced so hard with Tessa the receptionist that you broke one of your ribs.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It never healed properly.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Every breath is agony, son."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"So what's next, Tommy Davidson?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I say we invest our ten large and then I ""accidentally"" get run over by a city bus and we start our own hiphop label."
Tom Haverford,"Listen, we could play it safe, but that's not what E720 was about."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No it was not.
Tom Haverford,"We have this place for one more night, right?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We're outtie tomorrow at noon.
Tom Haverford,"What if we took every dime we had left, threw one last party."
Tom Haverford,Made it the essence of everything we wanted the company to be.
Tom Haverford,A party For the end of the world.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You had me at ""every dime we have left."""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because I'm in, like Lara Flynn, Boyle, from the practice."
Tom Haverford,Dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly dilly swag!
Chris Traeger,"Why does the cult call themselves ""The Reasonableists""?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, they figure if people criticize them,  it'll seem like they're attacking something very reasonable."
Ben Wyatt,That's weirdly brilliant.
Leslie Knope,"Look, there's nothing to worry about, they've said that the world is going to end 15 times."
Leslie Knope,And the only bad thing that's ever happened on any of those dates is Lance Armstrong dumping Sheryl Crow.
Chris Traeger,That was a tragic day.
Chris Traeger,Live strong.
Chris Traeger,"In any rate, I think Ben and I should accompany you tonight."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't think we have to do that."
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, I insist."
Chris Traeger,These people live on planet nutbrain.
Chris Traeger,I live on planet nut bran.
Chris Traeger,Bran and nuts are very helpful for your colon!
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looks like we're kind of forced to hang out with each other."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, listen, I'll I'll come for a bit, but if it's okay with you, I'm not going to stay."
Ben Wyatt,"It's just, you know, still kind of weird, right?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmhmm, totally get it."
Leslie Knope,Definitely get it.
Leslie Knope,Ben and I don't hang out much these days.
Leslie Knope,"Big deal, lots of people don't hang out."
Leslie Knope,Jerry and April.
Leslie Knope,"Obama and Madonna, probably."
Leslie Knope,We're in good company.
April Ludgate,What should we do tonight?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I just figure we'll just order some pizza."
Andy Dwyer,"You watch me play Xbox, and then I could watch you make some prank phone calls?"
Andy Dwyer,We get hammered?
Andy Dwyer,Make out?
April Ludgate,We do that every night.
Andy Dwyer,That's because repetition is the key to a good marriage.
April Ludgate,Let's do something weird.
April Ludgate,"Come on, it could be the last night on earth."
Andy Dwyer,We could do something off my bucket list.
April Ludgate,You have a bucket list?
Andy Dwyer,Catch the winning touchdown at the super bowl.
Andy Dwyer,Make the most amazing grilledcheese sandwich ever.
Andy Dwyer,Win the lottery.
Andy Dwyer,Ride a unicycle.
Andy Dwyer,Invent something.
Andy Dwyer,I'd like to remake the movie Shazaam with Shaquille O'Neal where he plays a genie and I'd like to get it right.
Andy Dwyer,Go skydiving.
Andy Dwyer,Outrun a hippo.
Andy Dwyer,Fly first class on plane.
Andy Dwyer,"And when people are walking by, be like this."
Andy Dwyer,Teach my son to throw the perfect spiral.
Andy Dwyer,Have a son.
April Ludgate,"All right, well, this is what we're doing tonight."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, which one?"
Andy Dwyer,We could change my cell phone plan.
Andy Dwyer,That would be fun.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,This one.
Extra,"800, 900, 1000."
April Ludgate,And how much is left in the bank account?
Extra,18 dollars.
Extra,and four cents.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Still a lot left over.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you wanted to hold 1,000 dollars cash in your hands"
Andy Dwyer,that's super disappointing.
Extra,"998, 999, 1000."
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Now this is what I imagined!
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever seen this much cash in your entire life?
Extra,I just handed it to you.
Andy Dwyer,Nickels!
Andy Dwyer,I want nickels.
Andy Dwyer,A billion nickels!
April Ludgate,"No, Andy."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Herb."
Ann Perkins,Sorry to bother you.
Herb Scaifer,"Yeah, sure."
Ann Perkins,Leslie said you still need to pay for the permit.
Ann Perkins,It's 28 dollars.
Herb Scaifer,"Oh, I'm sorry, here's a check. You can cash that tomorrrow."
Ron Swanson,"Evening, gentlemen."
Herb Scaifer,"Hey, Ron!"
Ron Swanson,Hail Zorp.
Ron Swanson,It is a beautiful night for the end of the world.
Ron Swanson,Congratulations to all of you for reaching the finish line.
Ron Swanson,The Zorpies are ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,"But, like the founding fathers, I believe in absolute freedom of religion."
Ron Swanson,Also their ceremonies require the playing of flutes.
Ron Swanson,I happen to make flutes in my wood shop.
Ron Swanson,Flutes are 80 dollars apiece.
Ron Swanson,And recorders are 150.
Herb Scaifer,"Hey, they're beautiful."
Herb Scaifer,Would you take a check?
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Tom Haverford,Welcome to E720's end of the world celebration.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The entire party's a VIP area.
Tom Haverford,There's also a double VIP area.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,A triple VIP area.
Tom Haverford,And the Centurion Club elite VIP area.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Sponsored by Sobe Lifewater.
Tom Haverford,"No one's allowed in there, not even us."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uh uh.
Tom Haverford,"We have not one, but six open bars."
Tom Haverford,"and best of all, snake juice ice luge."
Tom Haverford,Juice is so chilled.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Juice is so chilled.
Tom Haverford,Craps.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Roulette.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Argh, matey."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Pirate ship bouncy castle, with bubbles."
Tom Haverford,Shrimp wall.
Tom Haverford,"and special shrimp distributor, Indiana Pacers center, Roy Hibbert."
Roy Hibbert,This is all you want me to do?
Roy Hibbert,Pass out shrimp to people at the party?
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,And stop asking questions.
Tom Haverford,Got a head? Maybe you want a free fedora.
Tom Haverford,Want to make out? Go to our makeout room.
Tom Haverford,"And before you leave, don't forget your gift bag."
Tom Haverford,"Jean-Ralphio, are there any animals on the guest list tonight?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let me check T.T.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Oh just one.
Tom Haverford,Bengal Tiger.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Bengal Tiger.
Tom Haverford,"We also hired ten huge, scary bouncers with earpieces."
Tom Haverford,"What up, Keith?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,He actually once tossed me out of a club three years ago.
Tom Haverford,Water under the bridge.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,DJ Bluntz is mixing up some new beats.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Only 200 people will be admitted to retain exclusivity.
Tom Haverford,"Ballers and ballerettes, fasten your seatbelts."
Tom Haverford,The perfect party begins Clink!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Now.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Thank God.
Tom Haverford,No one shows up to a good party on time.
Tom Haverford,"If anybody actually showed up right now, the whole party would have been ruined."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It would have been a disaster.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I don't want to go to that party.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Does the city consider them a threat to public safety?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, not at all, Shauna MalwaeTweep."
Chris Traeger,It's been over 30 years since there's been any incident involving the Reasonableists.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,So I shouldn't interpret anything from the fact that there are two people from the city manager's office here?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, nothing except that I had nothing better to do."
Ben Wyatt,Which probably says more about me than them.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,Headline idea.
Leslie Knope,"""It's the end of the world as they know it, but Pawnee feels fine."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,It's a little long.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ""Zorp Shmorp!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Doomsday prediction falls flat as citizens spend pleasant evening enjoying one of Pawnee's finest parks."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Somehow longer.
Leslie Knope,"Right, okay let's go with the first one."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Great, um, hey, also He's cute."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Is he single, do you know?"
Leslie Knope,Chris?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He's actually dating Jerry's daughter.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, no sorry, I meant Ben."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What's his story?
Leslie Knope,Who?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Ben?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm not I'm not sure.
Leslie Knope,"He's, um, a man and he's a worker."
Leslie Knope,"And he is, we've never discussed sex, so It's we've always just been very businesslike, so Your guess is as good nay, better than mine."
Leslie Knope,The end.
Leslie Knope,By Leslie Knope.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Cool, thanks."
Leslie Knope,happy to help.
Ann Perkins,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,The world is ending.
Leslie Knope,"Oh boy, I know how this goes."
Leslie Knope,I know how Shauna operates.
Leslie Knope,"She smiles, and then they fall in love, and then they get married, and then she changes her name to Shauna Malwae Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,Or he's going to be really progressive and change his name to Ben Wyatt Malwae Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so annoyed that he would hypothetically do that."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie they're just talking."
Leslie Knope,"What's that, what do you mean just talking?"
Leslie Knope,He's smiling and she's being very charming.
Leslie Knope,Is she more charming than me?
Leslie Knope,"Ann, if you say yes, I will kick, I swear to God."
Ann Perkins,You're definitely more charming.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna remind you that the reason you're not dating him is because you decided to run for city council.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so just because I can't go out with him, someone else can?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy, okay."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm sure this is nothing."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, that was definitely something."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,My God.
Ann Perkins,I know that move.
Leslie Knope,They're gonna have sex in five minutes.
Leslie Knope,I've gotta stop this.
Leslie Knope,I've got to keep them away from each other for the rest of their lives.
Ann Perkins,How are you gonna do that?
Leslie Knope,Unclear!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, ten bucks!"
April Ludgate,That counts as winning the lottery.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, now is this the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich ever made?"
April Ludgate,"Mmm, it's pretty awesome."
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, my bucket list doesn't say ""make a pretty awesome grilled cheese sandwich."""
Andy Dwyer,Gotta go back to the store.
Andy Dwyer,We're gonna get a different kind of cheese.
April Ludgate,"No, no, no, dude, seriously."
April Ludgate,"This is the most amazing grilled cheese sandwich ever made, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,What's next?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you two are still talking?"
Leslie Knope,Ben hasn't bored you to death by now.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,So boring.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Actually, we were having a really great talk."
Leslie Knope,Keep your pants on.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Leslie Knope,"I mean, keep your pants on, girl!"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, those are really nice pants."
Leslie Knope,I really like your pants.
Leslie Knope,Where'd you get them?
Leslie Knope,Do you want to go buy some more pants?
Leslie Knope,"Or, um, walk away from here?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I actually think I have everything I need here.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I might head over to that end of the world party.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's where all the losers are going."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what is that?"
Ben Wyatt,Tom emailed me.
Ben Wyatt,I could check that out.
Leslie Knope,"Hur Well, then you should stay here then."
Leslie Knope,Because you can't go.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, what if you're not here when Zorp shows up?"
Leslie Knope,"Boy, would your face be red."
Herb Scaifer,"When Zorp shows up, your faces will be melted off and used as fuel."
Leslie Knope,You want to be here for that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I think I'll take my chances.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, thanks as always."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What an unbelievably unpleasant person.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Melissa, get in there  with your bad self."
Extra,All right.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You ready?
Extra,I'm ready.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Anything you grab is yours to keep.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hit it!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes!
Tom Haverford,The perfect party.
Tom Haverford,It's an elusive idea.
Tom Haverford,"People have to be completely entertained from the moment they walk in, to the moment they leave."
Tom Haverford,It's a grand experiment.
Tom Haverford,And I am a party scientist.
Tom Haverford,Welcome to my laboratory.
Chris Traeger,So you were living here when Reasonableism first swept in?
Ron Swanson,"I was. Lou Prozotovich, their founder, was an office supply salesman."
Ron Swanson,"One day, he had an interesting idea."
Ron Swanson,Maybe he could write a book to help people organize their offices.
Herb Scaifer,Organize It.
Ron Swanson,The book was a big success.
Ron Swanson,Then Lou had another interesting thought.
Ron Swanson,Maybe there was a 28 foot tall lizard with a volcano for a mouth who controlled the universe.
Chris Traeger,That is interesting.
Ron Swanson,So he wrote a second book.
Herb Scaifer,Organize it 2: Engage with Zorp.
Chris Traeger,"You know, can I have a look at that?"
Herb Scaifer,"Well, sure you can Chris, you can keep it."
Herb Scaifer,I'd skip the first couple chapters if I were you.
Herb Scaifer,"Between you and me, it doesn't really get good until Zorp shows up."
Ron Swanson,Zorp is the lizard.
Ron Swanson,What religion am I?
Ron Swanson,I'm a practicing none of your [bleep] business.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'm ready!"
April Ludgate,Good.
Andy Dwyer,Wait!
Andy Dwyer,I'm not ready.
Andy Dwyer,Super scared.
April Ludgate,"Andy, you said you wanted to be an action star."
April Ludgate,This is your chance.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Okay, you, Natalie, follow the action."
Jerry Gergich,What do I have to do?
April Ludgate,Just hold up this butter knife to my throat and pretend like you're holding me hostage.
Jerry Gergich,What?
April Ludgate,Ready!
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,It seems a little crazy.
Andy Dwyer,Just crazy enough to work.
April Ludgate,Aah!
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my face!"
Andy Dwyer,My face!
Andy Dwyer,"Is fine, Mikhail Petrov!"
Jerry Gergich,"Forget it, Macklin, you're too late  I'm sorry, guys."
April Ludgate,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,I need my cheaters.
Jerry Gergich,I cannot see any
Andy Dwyer,"you're doing really good, you're doing really good."
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Help me, Agent Macklin, help me!"
April Ludgate,"He's stolen my jewels, and now he's going to ravish my body and he stinks, he really stinks!"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, Janet Snakehole belongs to mother Russia now."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's what you think!"
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,I hope you like pain!
Andy Dwyer,Pow!
April Ludgate,Say the line.
Andy Dwyer,Looks like this Siberian husky is going to be Russian off to jail.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, know what, can I go?"
Jerry Gergich,Gayle is making a roast.
Jerry Gergich,Ugh.
Ron Swanson,That was Symphony for the Righteous Destruction of Humanity in E minor.
Ron Swanson,By the late Lou Prozotovich.
Ron Swanson,Reminder.
Ron Swanson,These flutes are available for purchase.
Ron Swanson,You can't take it with you people.
Chris Traeger,"Herb, I just speedread both of your books."
Herb Scaifer,Ooh.
Chris Traeger,"And, full disclosure, I think they're bonkersfilled."
Chris Traeger,But I did notice that you're interested in reincarnation.
Chris Traeger,Tell me about that.
Herb Scaifer,"Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?"
Herb Scaifer,"From the universe, we emerge."
Herb Scaifer,"Into the universe, we return."
Herb Scaifer,And there are infinite forms we can take in infinite universes.
Chris Traeger,What a lovely thought.
Herb Scaifer,"Well, this morning at dawn, you will take a new form."
Herb Scaifer,"That of a fleshless, chattering skeleton when Zorp the surveyor arrives and burns your flesh off with his volcano mouth."
Chris Traeger,That was very strange what you just said.
Chris Traeger,I don't like it as much as that other thing you said.
Herb Scaifer,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, where you going?"
Leslie Knope,Where you headed off to?
Leslie Knope,Do you want to play a fun game with me that I made up called chessrisk?
Leslie Knope,"It's half chess, half risk and takes like 15 hours to play."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, yeah, I think I'm gonna go."
Leslie Knope,I okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,I forgot I have a thing I need to show you.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I need to bring you there right now it's so amazing.
Leslie Knope,It's going to freak you out.
Leslie Knope,"It's, uh, it's something that we need to get in my car and go to, so let's do that."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, where are you going?"
Leslie Knope,I'm going to the thing that I told you about with Ben.
Leslie Knope,"No spoilers, Ann."
Leslie Knope,She's been there before.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"What's up, what's up?"
Tom Haverford,Are you guys having a good time tonight?
Tom Haverford,I think we've gotta take things to the next level.
Tom Haverford,"Drum line, hit it!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Here we go, here we go."
Ben Wyatt,We've already been down this street.
Leslie Knope,"Just out of curiosity, where's your favorite place to go like ever?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,Tom's party sounded kind of fun.
Leslie Knope,Here we are!
Leslie Knope,We're at the special place!
Leslie Knope,"Well, here we are."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Ben Wyatt,Are you gonna murder me and bury me at this gas station?
Leslie Knope,"No, this is a great gas station."
Leslie Knope,This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,"I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M."
Leslie Knope,"Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958."
Ben Wyatt,When he was 8.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I just knew you were a big fan of financial records, so, you're welcome."
Ben Wyatt,"I know what you're doing, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I'm showing you a part of Rock and Roll history.
Ben Wyatt,You you can't do this.
Ben Wyatt,You know we broke up.
Ben Wyatt,"And I kind of feel like we shouldn't Hang out together, just the two of us."
Ben Wyatt,"Because every time we do, it just makes it harder."
Ben Wyatt,You know?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,This one would get me arrested and this other one's impossible.
Andy Dwyer,because we need Eddie Vedder and a time machine.
Andy Dwyer,I think we've done everything on the list that we can actually do.
April Ludgate,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's it."
April Ludgate,What about this?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, that would be awesome."
Andy Dwyer,It's impossible.
April Ludgate,"No, it isn't."
April Ludgate,"We have $1,000 in our bank account, and we're young and irresponsible."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, our car would break down."
Andy Dwyer,There's no way we could even get there.
April Ludgate,So I'll steal my dad's car.
April Ludgate,"Look, this is a stupid idea, but right at this exact second, we have enough momentum to do something stupid before we realize how stupid it is."
Andy Dwyer,You are absolutely right.
Andy Dwyer,"No thinking, just stupid."
April Ludgate,Yes!
Chris Traeger,Buddhists feel that human beings are unlikely to be reincarnated as human beings.
Chris Traeger,So the problem with reincarnation is that you could be reborn as a pretzel.
Chris Traeger,Or a socket wrench.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, if you could be reincarnated, what would you like to be?"
Ron Swanson,"Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually."
Ann Perkins,I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the next lifetime that you forget to enjoy the one you're in now.
Chris Traeger, Ann Perkins that was beautiful.
Chris Traeger,Let's go to that party that Tom's having.
Chris Traeger,Have some fun in this life.
Ann Perkins,Sounds good.
Ron Swanson,"Wait, I want to change my answer, I'll go with bolt cutters."
Ann Perkins,Maybe you'll be reincarnated as a good dancer.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, you zinged me. I love that."
Donna Meagle, This is the best party I've ever been to.
Donna Meagle, And I'm not just saying that.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," For real, T.T., think about it man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Drum lines, personalized gift bags, tigers."
Tom Haverford, It's pretty great.
Tom Haverford, But it's not perfect.
Tom Haverford,I mean David Beckham didn't show up.
Donna Meagle,You knew that one was a long shot.
Donna Meagle,"Honestly, this is perfect."
Tom Haverford,I guess.
Lucy, Tom.
Tom Haverford," Hey, Lucy, what are you doing here?"
Lucy, Jean-Ralphio called me and told me that this was a very special occasion and I should come down.
Lucy, It's nice to see you.
Tom Haverford," Yeah, good to see you too."
Lucy, Want to go dance?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, yeah! Uh, give me a minute."
lucy, Okay.
Tom Haverford, I can't believe you called her for me.
Tom Haverford," That's really nice of you, man, for real."
Tom Haverford, Thanks.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," No, no, no, thank you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I mean for everything.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I actually forgot they ever dated.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I was trying to hit that.
Herb Scaifer," Dawn is nigh! Zorp the surveyor approaches, and all earthly debts will be repaid to the original source of life in the universe."
Herb Scaifer, Last call for doughnuts.
Leslie Knope,What would you do if the world was really going to end?
Ron Swanson,"I'd go home, drink some whiskey."
Ron Swanson,Then I'd go see my exwives.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I want to watch them meet their fiery end with my own eyes."
Ron Swanson,What would you do?
Leslie Knope, Can I speak with you about a personal matter?
Ron Swanson,"Normally, no."
Ron Swanson," But given there's only 20 minutes until the end of human existence Also, no."
Leslie Knope, I lost my mind tonight.
Leslie Knope, I tried to screw up even the potential of Ben dating someone else.
Ron Swanson, Did you not hear me when I said no?
Leslie Knope," Oh, we broke up because of me."
Leslie Knope," But I have to tell you, Ron If the world was ending tomorrow, I'd want to be with him."
Ron Swanson," Well, that's significant."
Ron Swanson," Problem is, Leslie, the world's not ending tomorrow."
Ron Swanson, The sun's going to rise right over there.
Ron Swanson," It'll be a regular Friday, and you'll be in the exact same position you were in before."
Leslie Knope, I know.
Leslie Knope,I made my decision. I need to stick to it.
Leslie Knope, It's just the thought of him with someone else is making me miserable.
Herb Scaifer," If it makes you feel any better, Leslie, we'll all be dead in 20 minutes."
Leslie Knope, That does make me feel better.
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Herb."
Ron Swanson,Guy's got ears like a fruit bat.
April Ludgate,We did it!
Andy Dwyer, Yay! 
Andy Dwyer,This car is nice! 
Andy Dwyer,How long you think it'll take us?
April Ludgate,"Uh, the map says 30 hours but I drive really fast."
Andy Dwyer,30 hours?
April Ludgate,Mm-hmm.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, crap! I didn't bring any music."
Andy Dwyer,Does your dad have anything good?
Andy Dwyer,"Ew, Starlight Express, the original cast recording, act 1."
Andy Dwyer,Who Moved My Cheese? Book on tape?
April Ludgate,Next.
Andy Dwyer,Bobby McFerrin.
April Ludgate,"No, we cannot listen to Bobby McFerrin for 60 hours of driving, we'll murder each other."
Andy Dwyer, No! I'll tell you what.
Andy Dwyer," You play whatever you want, I'm just going to take a real quick snooze for like 12 hours so I'm fresh."
Tom Haverford,   Thank you guys so much for coming out.
Tom Haverford," If you're too drunk to drive, please take one of our shuttles home."
Tom Haverford, Valet service will drop your car off later today.
Tom Haverford," If you're one of our designated drivers, please take a ""thank you"" bag."
Tom Haverford, And enjoy the giant bows I put on your car.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Lucy,Hey.
Tom Haverford,It's great seeing you.
Lucy,You too.
Tom Haverford," Are, uh, you sticking around for a bit, or "
Lucy,"Nah, I'm heading to Bloomington right now."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Lucy," Grad school's fun, but I do miss this town."
Tom Haverford, Yeah.
Lucy, What's wrong?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford," After this is done, I'm gonna be broke, and I'm not gonna have a job."
Lucy," Well, if it's any consolation, this was honestly the best party I've ever been to."
Tom Haverford," Hey, it was pretty great."
Tom Haverford, I I was really aiming for something
Lucy,I'll see you around.
Tom Haverford, Whoo.
Tom Haverford, You saw that.
Tom Haverford, You saw that too.
Leslie Knope, Shauna Malwae-Tweep thinks you're cute.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,That's why I took you to Mick Jagger's abandoned gas station.
Leslie Knope," Because she thinks you're cute, and I was afraid you guys were gonna make out and have babies, and I had no right to do that to you or your future children."
Leslie Knope, And it wasn't until just now that I realized the romantic part of our relationship is over.
Leslie Knope, So I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope," And, uh, why don't you tell Shauna to make herself decent and I'll apologize to her as well."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, well, Shauna's not here."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,See what I did?
Ben Wyatt, I do.
Leslie Knope, I'm very sneaky.
Leslie Knope," Okay, okay, well."
Andy Dwyer,   It's so much more beautiful than I could have ever even imagined.
April Ludgate, Yeah.
April Ludgate," I'm trying to find a way to be annoyed by it, but Coming up empty."
Andy Dwyer, Thank you so much.
Andy Dwyer, I never would have ever done this without you.
Andy Dwyer, Thank you.
Andy Dwyer, Where's all the faces? Like the presidents.
Herb Scaifer,"Frankly, Leslie, I'm shocked."
Herb Scaifer, All the scholarly work that I did on these texts? Indicated that the world would end.
Leslie Knope," Oh, gosh, I'm as disappointed as you are, Herb."
Herb Scaifer," Yeah, but when the world did not end, I went home and began to reevaluate the texts."
Leslie Knope, You don't say.
Herb Scaifer, And I realized that I'd made some crucial errors
Leslie Knope,"well, math is hard."
Herb Scaifer," Yes, well, the actual end of the world is six months from now."
Herb Scaifer,May 19th.
Leslie Knope," Okay, let's see what we've got."
Leslie Knope," Um, oh, on the 19th we can't give you the park."
Leslie Knope, We have a Spring spectacular free ice cream giveaway.
Herb Scaifer," Heh! Look here, I misspoke."
Herb Scaifer," Yeah, it's May 20? "
Leslie Knope,That is free.
Herb Scaifer, Ah!
Herb Scaifer,Okay.
Leslie Knope," End of World, May 20th."
Herb Scaifer,And could you put aside ten tickets to that ice cream thing?
Leslie Knope,Already did.

Leslie Knope,"Oh hey, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Have you seen my complete collection of all 193 national flags? Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Here they are.
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"So, I've been asked to run this year's Model UN at Pawnee Central High School."
Leslie Knope,Attendance has been low.
Leslie Knope,"And if I don't make it awesome, they may cancel it."
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'm gonna make it awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Or I can be South Korea, you can be Bangladesh."
Leslie Knope,You can form like a TransAsiatic alliance.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I like it."
Ben Wyatt,And I see the merits of it.
Ben Wyatt,"I just worry if we're both in Asia,  it might limit our scope."
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,I kinda want to roll up my sleeves and make geopolitical problem solving my bitch.
Leslie Knope,"Amen, brother."
Leslie Knope,"Let's go back to plan ""A."""
Leslie Knope,"I'll be Denmark, you be Peru."
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I didn't really do Model United Nations in high school, so Oh, wait."
Ben Wyatt,I super did.
Leslie Knope,I need a few more volunteers.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, will you be Iceland?"
Andy Dwyer,The bad guys from Mighty Ducks 2?
Andy Dwyer,Don't think so.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how about Japan?"
Andy Dwyer,The bad guys from Karate Kid 2?
Andy Dwyer,Even worse.
Andy Dwyer,How 'bout Germany?
Andy Dwyer,They've never been the bad guys.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you be Finland?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
April Ludgate,And I'll be the Moon.
Leslie Knope,"No, you're gonna be South Africa or  Pakistan."
April Ludgate,"I'm the Moon, or I quit."
Leslie Knope,April.
April Ludgate,"Moon or quit, man."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"You be South Africa, and you can also secretly run the moon."
April Ludgate,The Moon accepts your ridiculous proposal.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,You wanna join us?
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,I'll let you be America.
Ron Swanson,And teach kids that not only is government good but that there should be a Worldwide super government?
Ron Swanson,I'd rather sand down my toenails.
Ron Swanson,"Every three weeks, I have to sand down my toenails."
Ron Swanson,They're too strong for clippers.
Allison,Excuse me.
Allison,Are you Leslie Knope?
Allison,"Oh, what am I talking about?"
Allison,Of course you are.
Leslie Knope,"Bonjour, Madame Ambassadeur."
Allison,Thank you so much for coming and trying to help save our club.
Allison,We're so excited to see a true Pawnee Model UN legend in action.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I really wouldn't describe myself as a Model UN legend.
Leslie Knope,I'd go with icon.
Leslie Knope,Or hero.
Tom Haverford,"Look, if you ask me, Enron is down but not out."
Tom Haverford,Who doesn't like a comeback story?
Tom Haverford,"All right, you wanna hear my plan, get at me later."
Tom Haverford,I gotta meet up with an old friend.
Tom Haverford,"All right, peace, man."
Tom Haverford,Let's go do this lunch thing.
Ron Swanson,I just have one more quick interview.
Ron Swanson,I'm still trying to find your replacement.
Ron Swanson,"That is, unless you want your old job back."
Tom Haverford,"I told you before, Ronseph, I moved on to bigger things."
Tom Haverford,E720 going under was a blessing.
Tom Haverford,I'm tearing it up all over town like a boss.
Ron Swanson,"Sounds great, Tommy."
Ron Swanson,"I've offered Tom his job back several times, and each time he's told me he's just too busy being an entrepreneur."
Ron Swanson,"Then two days ago, I saw him spraying cologne samples at Macy's."
Ron Swanson,The young man has a lot of pride.
Ron Swanson,This isn't gonna be easy.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Chris, how's it going?"
Chris Traeger,Not good.
Chris Traeger,Can I talk to you?
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"I'm not sure if you're aware, but I am romantically involved with Jerry Gergich's surprisingly hot daughter  Millicent Gergich."
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,You were grinding with her pretty hard at April's Halloween party.
Chris Traeger,That's correct.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, we've been on four dates, but now Millicent Gergich hasn't returned my last two phone calls."
Chris Traeger,"I think the relationship may be in trouble, and I don't know why."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,A four date long relationship might not be 100% perfect?
Ann Perkins,I think you should launch a fullscale investigation.
Chris Traeger,"The root of sarcasm is truth, Ann."
Chris Traeger,I am going to launch a fullscale investigation.
Chris Traeger,And I sincerely thank you for that suggestion.
Ann Perkins,Glad I could help in these trying times.
Chris Traeger,Sarcasm again!
Chris Traeger,You're a delight.
Leslie Knope,You've all been preparing for months for this year's geopolitical scenario global food crisis.
Leslie Knope,"Security Council, we need you to lead us, or billions of people will starve to death."
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, have fun."
Leslie Knope,"Due to my campaign, the romantic aspect of our relationship is over."
Leslie Knope,And I'm totally fine with that.
Leslie Knope,But Ben and I have so much in common.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we're amazing friends."
Leslie Knope,And friendship is better because friends help you move.
Leslie Knope,They drive you to the airport.
Leslie Knope,Boyfriends just love you and marry you.
Chris Traeger,Jerry!
Chris Traeger,"I am launching a fullscale investigation into my romantic relationship with your daughter Millicent Gergich, and I thought I could pick your brain."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, jeez, I really shouldn't be involved in something"
Chris Traeger,Quick recap things were going wonderfully.
Chris Traeger,We clicked on an emotional level.
Chris Traeger,"And then suddenly, I just stopped hearing from her."
Chris Traeger,"Now, you must know her pretty well what gives?"
Donna Meagle,Here's what I saw go down.
Chris Traeger,Donna!
Chris Traeger,Yeah!
Chris Traeger,Get in on this.
Donna Meagle,You're too accessible.
Donna Meagle,"Every time she calls, you answer."
Donna Meagle,"You gotta dangle the carrot, literally and metaphorically."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Donna!"
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, Donna."
Ron Swanson,So Courtney.
Ron Swanson,This says you retired in 1968.
Extra,"No, no, no."
Extra,I was fired because I made a pass at an ethnic woman.
Tom Haverford,And what have you been doing for the last 43 years?
Extra,"Oh, you know, hitchhiking around."
Extra,I went to Mexico.
Extra,I met a lot of ethnic girls.
Extra,They grow on trees down there.
Extra,I was in jail for a spell That about brings it up to date.
Ron Swanson,"Sounds to me like you're ready to get back in the game, Courtney."
Ron Swanson,We'll be in touch.
Ron Swanson,Another very strong candidate.
Tom Haverford,Are you insane?
Tom Haverford,He was a million year old racist!
Ron Swanson,"He said he liked ethnic girls, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, Ron, but I created a legacy here, and I need to make sure it's protected."
Tom Haverford,Let's bring in some more people.
Tom Haverford,"In my four years here, I revolutionized the position of administrator and made this place cool."
Tom Haverford,I was the first person to abbreviate Parks and Recreation Department.
Tom Haverford,First it was Parks and Recreation.
Tom Haverford,Then Parks and Rec.
Tom Haverford,Then P&R.
Tom Haverford,Then lengthened it just a little bit to Tommy's place.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait a minute."
Leslie Knope,I think I have it.
Leslie Knope,What if we dropped interest rates.
Leslie Knope,Would that help you?
Ben Wyatt,Maybe.
Ben Wyatt,But what if Brazil and Argentina use their oil deposits as collateral?
Allison,"Oh, that's really good."
Leslie Knope,"Underexaggerate much, France?"
Ben Wyatt,Ha ha!
Ben Wyatt,Nice!
William Barnes,"Hey, Leslie, you ready?"
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, William."
William Barnes,Hi.
William Barnes,You ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,Um They want me to do a photo op for the campaign so I can bolster my education credentials.
Leslie Knope,Can we just press pause here?
Ben Wyatt,How long is it gonna take?
Leslie Knope,I'm not really sure.
Leslie Knope,Can you just tread water until I'm ready?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, sure, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,I'll just tread water until you're ready.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie and I aren't dating anymore, but, uh, we're friends."
Ben Wyatt,So it's fun.
Ben Wyatt,It's just fun.
Ben Wyatt,It's fun it's fun It is fun.
Andy Dwyer,Thanks a lot.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,Honey!
Andy Dwyer,I just traded Finland's military to Kenya for 50 lions.
Andy Dwyer,"That's pretty good, right?"
April Ludgate,Yeah 
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
April Ludgate,But also militaries are pretty good at protecting countries.
Andy Dwyer,But so are lions.
Andy Dwyer,And you don't have to pay them.
Andy Dwyer,These kids are idiots.
Andy Dwyer,I've just traded all of Finland's boring stuff for every other country's lions?
Andy Dwyer,I definitely have more lions than any other country in the whole world right now.
Andy Dwyer,I have no idea what's going on.
Andy Dwyer,"But if that ends up meaning something in this game, I'd say I'm set."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so Russia and China are about to propose their own plan, so the kids kinda want to get ours out there."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay this should probably only take five more minutes."
William Barnes,Let's say 10 or 15 to be safe.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, how about me make it a cool 40?"
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,It's just important.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is important too."
Ben Wyatt,It's kinda why we came here.
William Barnes,"I'm sorry, could you Just step over here?"
William Barnes,You're in the shot.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, of course."
Extra,Her life is so awesome.
Extra,You're lucky you're friends with her.
Ben Wyatt,"Shut up, Bulgaria!"
Ben Wyatt,"I know, well, that's the great thing about treaties,  It doesn't even matter."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,I'm back.
Leslie Knope,"Or, as they say in Denmark ""I'm back."
Leslie Knope,""" Most people speak English."
Leslie Knope,So are you guys ready to polish off this treaty?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh actually, I merged our treaty with Russia and China's treaty."
Leslie Knope,I got cut out of my own treaty?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I got sick of treading water, so I swam over to Asia, made a deal."
Leslie Knope,The nation of Denmark would like to formerly request a summit with the nation of Peru over there by the refreshment table.
Leslie Knope,Because the nation of Denmark needs a juice box.
Leslie Knope,I am shocked an appalled by the actions of the honorable delegate from Peru.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, just look I thought I could handle being friends with you."
Ben Wyatt,"But I can't, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Now, we agreed the other night that we can't spend time together."
Ben Wyatt,I think that was the right call.
Leslie Knope,But that was in a romantic way.
Leslie Knope,We can still spend time together as friends.
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't work that way.
Ben Wyatt,You can't just chop up the aspects of a relationship into discrete parts and select the ones you want like a buffet.
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Ben Wyatt,Because it's selfish.
Ben Wyatt,Stop being obtuse.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I understand where he's coming from."
Leslie Knope,"But I have been nothing but straightforward with him, and if anyone in the entire world should understand the difficult position I'm in, it's It's just I've made an effort and I've shared my flags with him, and suddenly, he doesn't want to be friends?"
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,That leaves me with only one option.
Leslie Knope,Just excuse me for a
Leslie Knope,Attention.
Leslie Knope,This is an urgent world matter.
Leslie Knope,"Due to a recent betrayal, my homeland, the great state of Denmark, has officially decided to declare war on Peru."
Leslie Knope,"Scandinavian brothers, on my signal."
Leslie Knope,Unleash hell!
Chris Traeger,"See, I just don't believe in this whole don't let people know how you feel nonsense."
Chris Traeger,I love telling people how I feel.
Chris Traeger,Mostly because I love most people.
Chris Traeger,And I love telling them that I love them.
Donna Meagle,"You didn't tell that girl you love her, did you?"
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I'm not crazy.
Ann Perkins,What is this urgent meeting with Donna and Jerry?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,I took your advice.
Ann Perkins,My sarcastic advice.
Chris Traeger,Precisely.
Chris Traeger,"And we're getting to the bottom of what's going on with me and Jerry's daughter, and I thought you would be a tremendous addition to this think tank."
Ann Perkins,This is incredibly inappropriate.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank you!"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm game."
Extra,No.
Extra,I'm not kidding.
Extra,"My name's Gary, and I'm from Gary, Indiana."
Ron Swanson,Amazing.
Extra,People like hearing that.
Extra,It's probably one of my stronger anecdotes.
Tom Haverford,"A fact is not an anecdote, Gary."
Tom Haverford,Here's an anecdote Today I met the most boring man in the world.
Tom Haverford,His name was Gary.
Extra,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,Now Keith.
Ron Swanson,"Under sex, you wrote ""Yes."""
Ron Swanson,"Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha."
Ron Swanson,Well played.
Extra,Thank you.
Extra,"Ah, but all jokes aside."
Extra,I'm a boy.
Tom Haverford,"Keith, I had this job for four years."
Tom Haverford,"And I can tell you, you get out of it what you put into it."
Tom Haverford,What are you hoping to get out of it?
Extra,In like a month or so.
Tom Haverford,What?
Extra,Oh What!
Extra,What am I hoping to get out of this job?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,Like one one month of money... Would be would be just right.
Tom Haverford,Let me give you a situation.
Tom Haverford,You're hosting a town hall meeting for local businesses.
Extra,Uh That's so much stuff.
Extra,"You just, uh kept on going."
Tom Haverford,That was like one thing.
Tom Haverford,I didn't even get to the situation yet.
Extra,Oh!
Extra,All right.
Extra,"Well, thanks, guys."
Extra,I think we've all seen enough.
Extra,Still not totally sure what I'm applying for.
Extra,"But if you ask me, I think it went pretty well."
Leslie Knope,"What we need to focus on is how to destroy Peru, specifically one person who lives there."
Allison,"Madame Ambassador, are you changing the scenario?"
Allison,We didn't prepare for this.
Leslie Knope,"Global politics can change, and scenarios can arise and suddenly you're just like, ""wait, I thought this one thing, but look over there."""
Leslie Knope,"""That's a different thing, and it's changing everything,"" and I'm like, ""What?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Hold up."""
Leslie Knope,Who has tanks for me?
Extra,"I'm sorry, but... We're gonna keep trying to solve the food crisis."
Leslie Knope,Food schmood.
Leslie Knope,This is war.
Leslie Knope,"God, it's time for you to nut up, Switzerland."
Leslie Knope,"Well, well, well, look who is brave enough to show his face in Europe."
Andy Dwyer,"Say the word, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I'll sick my army of lions on him.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, I think, um Things are starting to get a little out of control here."
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope,"You betrayed me, and you went behind my back, and now you need to pay."
Ben Wyatt,I need to I need to pay.
Leslie Knope,Do I stutter?
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,You might wanna borrow this.
April Ludgate,"Ew, no one wants your dirty underwear, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,It's not dirty underwear.
Ben Wyatt,"It's a white flag, and you may as well start waving it right now"
Leslie Knope,the only thing I will be waving is your decapitated head on a stick in front of your weeping mother!
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Tom Haverford,"They were duds, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"Really, anything would be better than the people we interviewed today."
Ron Swanson,"I guess you're right, Tom."
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna find another you.
Ron Swanson,You were perfect.
Ron Swanson,"Competent enough to keep the bosses off my back, but selfish enough to slow down all the work."
Ron Swanson,Tom Haverfords don't grow on trees.
Tom Haverford,"If they did, I'd sell 'em."
Tom Haverford,Tommy trees.
Ron Swanson,Would you consider coming back?
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ron."
Tom Haverford,No can do.
Tom Haverford,I'm like a shark.
Tom Haverford,I don't swim backwards.
Tom Haverford,"See ya later, man."
Allison,We've been making great strides with genetically modified crops and would gladly pledge to continue the growth of--
Ben Wyatt,"excuse me, Madame Ambassador."
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Allison,I'm not finished.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, really?"
Ben Wyatt,Then why do I have the microphone?
Ben Wyatt,I move that the Security Council formally condemn Denmark and stop them from making any more unwarranted acts of aggression.
Extra,As long as you quit derailing the conference.
Extra,People are dying of hunger in Africa.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, cry me a river."
Ben Wyatt,All in favor of the resolution.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's interesting."
Ben Wyatt,The resolution passes with flying colors.
Ben Wyatt,Denmark is formally condemned.
Ben Wyatt,Bam!
Leslie Knope,"That's no problemo, Peru, because Denmark no longer recognizes the authority of this international gang of thugs."
Leslie Knope,And history will be unkind to those who stand opposed to justice.
Leslie Knope,"Together, we stand and I ask all of you who is ready to join the Coalition of the Willing?"
April Ludgate,The Moon shall join your coalition.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,We got the freaking moon.
Leslie Knope,"What are you gonna do without tides, Peru?"
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,We need to stop dealing in hypotheticals.
Chris Traeger,"Ann, we dated."
Chris Traeger,What happened to us?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna get real?
Chris Traeger,Sure.
Chris Traeger,Sounds like fun.
Ann Perkins,Sometimes your relentless cheeriness is confusing.
Ann Perkins,Like that time we went to Eagleton and we got that hotel room with the jacuzzi 
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, this just got real good!"
Ann Perkins,And the jacuzzi broke.
Chris Traeger,But I did eat food off of your body.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, come on."
Donna Meagle,"All right, Chris and Ann!"
Jerry Gergich,I just wanna go back to work.
Leslie Knope,"So the Coalition of the Willing is Denmark, Botswana, and the Moon."
Andy Dwyer,The big three.
Leslie Knope,"Now, here's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,Ben is probably shoring up his support in South America.
Leslie Knope,"While he does that, we are gonna make sure--"
Allison,Attention!
Allison,The Security Council has decided to expel Peru and Denmark from the United Nations.
Leslie Knope,Madame Ambassadeur Pourquoi?
Allison,'Cause you guys suck.
Allison,Look around.
Allison,We thought you were gonna teach us how to solve problems.
Allison,You've ruined my favorite club.
Allison,Thanks a lot.
Andy Dwyer,Did we win?
Andy Dwyer,I think we won!
Andy Dwyer,What were we trying to do?
Andy Dwyer,I learned so much today.
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I thought it was really cool how everything fell apart in there.
April Ludgate,"And also, maybe you should talk to Ben."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,"When Ben gets upset, he becomes a really bad roommate."
April Ludgate,He takes really long sadness baths and makes me late for stuff.
Leslie Knope,I hate it here.
Leslie Knope,Can't wait to graduate.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but summer's gonna totally kick ass."
Chris Traeger,So you're saying that I intimidated you?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,Not exactly.
Donna Meagle,Come on.
Donna Meagle,Talk more about that tantric workshop y'all went to.
Ann Perkins,"I was so into you, okay, and you basically turned me into a female version of yourself, and then you got bored dating me because you were dating yourself."
Ann Perkins,"Huh I mean, I was jogging."
Ann Perkins,I hate jogging.
Chris Traeger,Jogging's amazing!
Ann Perkins,"Jogging is the worst, Chris."
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I know it keeps you healthy, but God, at what cost?"
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm sorry that I added five years to your life."
Chris Traeger,Now I'm being sarcastic.
Chris Traeger,Like you.
Chris Traeger,I'm doing something that you like.
Ann Perkins,"Being with you definitely made me do a lot of soul searching, and I came out the other side being a much more selfpossessed person."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm glad."
Ann Perkins,Good luck with Millicent.
Ann Perkins,Just back off a little bit.
Ann Perkins,Let her be herself.
Ann Perkins,Everything'll be fine.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"If you rearrange the letters of Peru, you could spell Europe."
Ben Wyatt,That's That's not true.
Andy Dwyer,Well You have to rearrange them.
Andy Dwyer,Oh  Delegates!
Andy Dwyer,I know that you're angry with each other.
Andy Dwyer,"Hopefully, this will be your opportunity to have your very own Camp David."
Andy Dwyer,"In high school, my buddy David Fundis would have these campouts in his backyard."
Andy Dwyer," We would just chill out, have a bonfire, talk about whatever was on our mind."
Andy Dwyer, We called it camp David.
Ben Wyatt, How do you know about Camp David?
Andy Dwyer,How do you know about camp David?
April Ludgate,okay.
April Ludgate," You guys are being stupid, so why don't you work it out while Andy and I "
Andy Dwyer,Throw these scientist bottles off the roof?
Leslie Knope, No.
April Ludgate, That's right.
April Ludgate, See ya.
April Ludgate, Go.
April Ludgate, Go.
April Ludgate, Go.
April Ludgate, Go.
April Ludgate, Go.
Leslie Knope," It's bad enough that we can't be together, but the thought of us not being friends is Is just too crappy for me to handle."
Ben Wyatt, I was perhaps a little icier than I needed to be.
Leslie Knope, I just need you to be in my life.
Leslie Knope, You're too important to me.
Ben Wyatt, I wish I could say it's possible.
Ben Wyatt, I just I don't know if it is right now.
Leslie Knope," Well, I propose a treaty that states that we have a fun conversation once a day at work for five minutes."
Ben Wyatt, I'll take it to the Peruvian senate.
Ben Wyatt, Or whatever.
Leslie Knope,Please do that.
Ben Wyatt,I'll try.
Ben Wyatt, I'll see what they say.
Leslie Knope, What do we do with those kids? We totally ruined their club.
Ben Wyatt, I could tell you what I would like when I was their age.
Leslie Knope," Ben, how are we gonna get Kathy Ireland to do naked aerobics for them?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt, I regret telling you that very much.
Ron Swanson, Hey.
Tom Haverford," Oh, hey, Ron."
Ron Swanson, All right.
Ron Swanson, I gotta come clean.
Ron Swanson, I saw you spraying cologne samples at Macy's.
Tom Haverford, What? Macy's? That wasn't me.
Tom Haverford, There's a Macy's in town? Where's the Macy's in town? I heard they have an amazing cologne sample guy.
Ron Swanson," Just take the job, Tommy."
Ron Swanson, Come on back.
Tom Haverford, I quit to peruse my dream.
Tom Haverford, And my dream collapsed.
Tom Haverford," It's embarrassing, Ron."
Tom Haverford, I can't go from a CEO back to being an administrator.
Ron Swanson, Is there anything I can do to make you feel okay about coming back?
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, please Help me."
Ron Swanson, I'm trying to get Tom back.
Ron Swanson, I'm begging.
Ron Swanson, This department just doesn't work without you.
Ron Swanson, What do you say?
Tom Haverford,"Ron, this is embarrassing."
Tom Haverford, Even for you.
Tom Haverford, I'm not coming back.
Tom Haverford," Peace out, my dudes."
Ron Swanson," Excuse me, everyone."
Tom Haverford, That was great.
Tom Haverford," So what I'm thinking is I'll come back in a few days, you'll beg me again aah! So if it's okay with you guys, I would like to ask Ron for my job back."
Tom Haverford," Ron May I have my job back, please? Thank you."
Tom Haverford, I will see you all Monday.
Ron Swanson, Looking forward to it.
Leslie Knope," Ah, France, bienvenue."
Allison," My name is Cassidy, and I'm really annoyed with you."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope," And you have every right to be, but we're hoping what we're gonna show you right now will make up for that."
Allison,"What? Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Pawnee City Council chambers.
Leslie Knope, The nicest room in City Hall by a factor of like a million.
Leslie Knope, Go ahead.
Leslie Knope, Sit down.
Ben Wyatt, Leslie and I feel terrible for war breaking out at your Model U.N
Leslie Knope," Which, for the record, Denmark would have won, but that's neither here nor there."
Leslie Knope," Thanks to a coordinated effort between the parks department and the city manager's office, three months from now, we are gonna hold a State-wide Model U.N."
Leslie Knope," In this room, and you're gonna run the show."
Allison,What?
Leslie Knope,And we will just be not here.
Leslie Knope,Or taking some small countries.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, Fine.
Leslie Knope, Not here.
Leslie Knope,Sound good?
Allison,Yes!
Leslie Knope, Those kids are passionate about something.
Leslie Knope, That's important.
Leslie Knope," That's all there is, really, is passion."
Leslie Knope, Passion is what makes for good treaties Good relationships Good pizza.
Leslie Knope, Good friends.
Leslie Knope, Good everything.
Leslie Knope, Including wars.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and Gentlemen, ""He was gone but never forgotten."""
Leslie Knope,"""He makes all the ladies want"" No, I'm not gonna say that."
Leslie Knope," ""Swagger beats and I get the-- Who's the"" All right, forget it."
Leslie Knope," Welcome back, Tom Haverford!"
Tom Haverford," Tick-tock, it's Tommy time!"
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, I have to object again."
Jerry Gergich, This just seems unfair.
Leslie Knope," I understand that, Jerry."
Leslie Knope," But the problem is is that Tom came back and Andy's my assistant, so I kinda need him close to me."
Jerry Gergich," Okay, but I can't even hear anything because of the noise from the copier."
April Ludgate, Sorry.
April Ludgate, These are really important.

Chris Traeger,Tom!
Chris Traeger,I would like you to redesign our Parks department logo.
Tom Haverford,Sounds cool so far.
Chris Traeger,"Rethink our visual brand, take these words, and make something amazing."
Tom Haverford,So you're saying you want me to choose a new font.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, essentially I'd like you to choose a new font. Jerry, I am making you my number two guy on the new font project."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, that's too close."
Tom Haverford,Let's make him a number three.
Chris Traeger,Fair enough.
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, you're number three."
Jerry Gergich,There's only two of us.
Chris Traeger,He has been in this department a long time.
Chris Traeger,I think maybe you could learn somethg from him.
Leslie Knope,"Our research shows that our park will draw and I want this to be the most amazing, awe inspiring, fun filled park ever conceived."
Chris Traeger,"Now how big is the park, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,it is .000003 square miles.
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the last remaining telephone booths in Pawnee were torn down, and on that patch of concrete, I am creating Pawnee's newest tourist attraction The smallest park in Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"The title is currently held by Martin Luther King, Jr."
Leslie Knope,"Park in Terryville, but guess what?"
Leslie Knope,"Terryville sucks old car tires, and so does Martin Luther No, he does not suck old car tires."
Leslie Knope,He was one of the greatest men in history.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Sometimes I get competitive.
Chris Traeger,Has there been any resistance from the community?
Ben Wyatt,"No, not at all."
Ben Wyatt,It's so small we don't even need to do an environmental impact report.
Ben Wyatt,"It's inexpensive, it benefits the town, it's a total slam dunk."
Chris Traeger,"You two, when you work on a project together, are simply amazing."
Chris Traeger,Great job team.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, all these classes look amazing."
Andy Dwyer,I can't choose.
April Ludgate,"They do this thing called a ""shopping period,"" where you can just sample as many classes as you want."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Sports and Society.
Andy Dwyer,Physical Science.
Andy Dwyer,A crash course?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but it's not what you think."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"I did not graduate college, because I did not ""attend"" it, but I'm trying to improve myself, so I'm gonna start by taking just one class."
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna take a college course, Andrew, you should explore a new subject."
Ron Swanson,Broaden your horizons.
Andy Dwyer,Yup.
April Ludgate,Horizons are dumb.
April Ludgate,Never broaden your horizons.
Andy Dwyer,Yup.
April Ludgate,"Just take something you're great at and get an easy ""A""."
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, Ron, but April's way sounds way easier."
Andy Dwyer,Guitar for beginners.
Ron Swanson,"I value a good education, so I don't want to see Andy waste his time in college."
Ron Swanson,"Of all my coworkers, he is one of a small number whom I do not actively root against."
Ron Swanson,"Ugh, there I go getting all sappy."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"So, I have about nine things I need to talk to you about."
Leslie Knope,The first is the ribbon cutting ceremony.
Leslie Knope,Do you know who's bringing scissors?
Leslie Knope,Because I cannot tell you how many ceremonies get derailed when people don't bring scissors.
Leslie Knope,Number two
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, listen."
Ben Wyatt,I'm actually glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Ben Wyatt,"After this project finishes, I'm gonna focus on other departments and cut down my time with Parks and Rec."
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look, I mean, we tried hanging out together, we tried working together, and it just Bums me out."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope,We're just working out the kinks.
Leslie Knope,You don't need to decrease your time with me.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, you need to increase your time with me."
Leslie Knope,You need to spend more time with me.
Leslie Knope,That make sense?
Leslie Knope,I think it does.
Ben Wyatt,"No, Leslie, no, listen to me."
Ben Wyatt,"After The Smallest Park wraps up, I am going to ask Chris to take over all Parks and Rec business."
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to ascertain the whereabouts of some oversized ceremonial scissors."
Ben Wyatt,Those are my pens and pencils.
Jerry Gergich,"No, see, I think that Comic Sans always screams ""fun."""
Jerry Gergich,Right?
Jerry Gergich,"But, man, those ""r""s in Helvetica, they're just, you know, like, really popping for me."
Tom Haverford,I've never been more bored in my entire life.
Tom Haverford,Who cares about letters?
Tom Haverford,"The only good font is the Sopranos one, where the ""r"" is a pistol."
Tom Haverford,"Let's think bigger, people, come on."
Tom Haverford,What about a top to bottom makeover for the entire department?
Tom Haverford,"I'm talking new uniforms, new signage, new color scheme."
Tom Haverford,"A whole, new, sexy vibe."
Jerry Gergich,I don't know.
Jerry Gergich,This really isn't what Chris asked us to do.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, maybe we should just stick to the assignment."
Tom Haverford,"Cool, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,I'd take your advice if I wanted to be a deadeyed government drone with no ambition.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, technically my new job is my old job, but I'm not some boring, Jerry Gergich type guy."
Tom Haverford,I'm more of a Steve Harvey.
Tom Haverford,"I dream big, I shake things up, and I always wear dope suits."
Extra,"Okay, can anyone tell me what this is called?"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, that's a fret."
Extra,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,And that little thing you got right there that's called a capo.
Andy Dwyer,Changes the key.
Extra,"Uh, maybe you should be in the advanced class?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, maybe I should."
April Ludgate,"Dude, dumb it down."
Andy Dwyer,"But I couldn't possibly, because I'm just a beginner."
Andy Dwyer,"I barely haven't even ever seen a ""gortar."
extra,Okay.
Extra,We will be working on basic chords for the first four weeks.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,Four weeks.
Andy Dwyer,I'm already bored.
Ron Swanson,Of course you are.
Ron Swanson,You're not challenging yourself.
Ron Swanson,I suggest we sample a few more classes.
April Ludgate,Fine.
extra,Very good.
Andy Dwyer,"Goodbye, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,Guess what.
Andy Dwyer,I was secretly an undercover rock star this whole time.
Ron Swanson,"For what it's worth, I think you would make an incredible brunette."
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, he's not even attending the ribboncutting ceremony of a park that we made together."
Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,I'm just freaking out.
Leslie Knope,The only thing we have left is work.
Leslie Knope,And now he doesn't want to work together anymore?
Leslie Knope,What does that all mean?
Ann Perkins,I think you know what it means.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.
Ann Perkins,That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.
Leslie Knope,"No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, for God's sakes."
Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, please, I beg of you."
Leslie Knope,Will you just shut your beautiful pie hole?
Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, let me stare at you while you silently support me on this game plan."
Ann Perkins,Leslie 
Leslie Knope, Shh  
Ann Perkins,Leslie
Leslie Knope,Ann  Your quiet support means the world to me.
Leslie Knope,As well as your tacit endorsement of all my behaviors.
Leslie Knope,"As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together."
Leslie Knope,"So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting."
Leslie Knope,"The proposed park is very small, but we believe we need to investigate every detail."
Leslie Knope,"So if anyone has any questions for me or assistant city manager Ben Wyatt, go right ahead."
Extra,"Hi, I have a question about this project."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Leslie Knope,Where's the fire?
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other first.
Leslie Knope,Tell me about your childhood.
Extra,Is there going to be basketball there?
extra,Basketball courts attract undesirables to my community.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there's barely room for an actual basketball, much less a court."
extra,"Because there's a definite type of person I associate with basketball, and I'd rather not have that type of person nearby."
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry.
Ben Wyatt,You don't need to worry.
extra,"Okay, I'll just come right out and say it."
extra,I'll tell you what type of person I don't like.
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to do that.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,I think we get it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we do, Rose, and you bring up a very good point."
Leslie Knope,Intolerance.
Leslie Knope,Can we be doing more?
Leslie Knope,I'd like to hear from each and every one of you about a time when prejudice has touched your lives.
Extra,"Hello, everyone."
Extra,My name is Professor Barnes.
Extra,The class I'll be teaching this semester is introduction to lasers.
Extra,"The word ""laser"" stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation."
Andy Dwyer,Where are the lasers?
Extra,This graphic here represents the electromagnetic spectrum arranged from low frequency
Andy Dwyer,He's not even using a laser pointer.
April Ludgate,He's right.
April Ludgate,This class stinks.
Ron Swanson,Stick with it.
Ron Swanson,You might learn something.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, excuse me."
Andy Dwyer,Professor?
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, there."
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,Curious.
Andy Dwyer,When will you be bringing out the lasers for me to play with?
Andy Dwyer,"And will we start with the small lasers, or could we go just straight to the big lasers, in terms of playing with them?"
Extra,We won't be using actual lasers in this course.
Extra,It's about the theory that makes them possible.
Andy Dwyer,One of the most significant bummers of my lifetime.
Tom Haverford,"First up, a personal favorite, the Sopranos option."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I guarantee you, anyone that sees this logo is not gonna ""fugghedaboudit."""
Tom Haverford,This is our current community center.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,This is our new community center!
Tom Haverford,"That's right, it looks like an apple store."
Tom Haverford,"Today, I'm a Beverly hills plastic surgeon, and the Parks department is a wrinkly old housewife in her early 30s."
Tom Haverford,I'm about to work a miracle.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,What a story.
Leslie Knope,Anyone else?
Leslie Knope,"Anyone Uh, this gentleman wants to say something."
Mel,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Mel."
Leslie Knope,You're always up in arms about something.
Mel,"No, I'm not."
Mel,I'm not always up in arms about something.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about what's bothering you.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, that'll do it."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, everybody."
Leslie Knope,I once hosted a forum about a new bike rack that lasted seven hours.
Leslie Knope,"Now when I need these people to complain, they're done in 45 minutes?"
April Ludgate,"Whoa, check it out."
April Ludgate,You can get credit for playing intramural frisbee golf.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, you can take a class on the Civil War."
Andy Dwyer,Why would I take a class on something that's already happened?
Andy Dwyer,"Look, you guys have already had your say."
Andy Dwyer,Now I want to try something that I want to try.
Andy Dwyer,"And I'm gonna make my choice as I always do, at random."
Linda Lonegan,"As she was burned at the stake, Joan of Arc did not cower."
Linda Lonegan,She did not beg for mercy.
Linda Lonegan,"she said, in a strong, clear voice, ""I am not afraid."""
Linda Lonegan,"""I was born to do this."""
April Ludgate,I want to be burned at the stake.
Linda Lonegan,Many societal institutions were established solely to oppress women.
Linda Lonegan,"To this day, some feminists have even condemned marriage as a glorified form of slavery."
Ron Swanson,Amen.
April Ludgate,That class was awesome.
Ron Swanson,I wholeheartedly agree.
Ron Swanson,"If that woman weren't so violently opposed to marriage, I think I would propose to her."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, then, it's decided."
Andy Dwyer,"Andy Dwyer will be taking ""women's lasers."""
April Ludgate,Women's studies.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,"God, I cannot stop thinking about lasers."
Andy Dwyer,"""Women's studies."""
Andy Dwyer,"Is there such thing as ""women's lasers""?"
Andy Dwyer,That'd be my number one pick.
Extra,"Excuse me, what the heck is going on here?"
Leslie Knope,Just preparing for the grand opening of this tiny but very intrusive park.
Extra,We were told this would have very little impact on the neighborhood.
Extra,This flyer has hundreds of events.
Mel,There are fireworks every night at midnight?
Leslie Knope,They start at midnight.
Leslie Knope,Who knows when they're gonna end?
Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't even know the impact of this park, because the city skipped an environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,So we don't know about traffic problems or sound or lights or crime.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's all a mystery."
Extra,Don't you work for the government?
Leslie Knope,"I do, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's how I know just how high this conspiracy goes."
Leslie Knope,What can we do about it?
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you asked.
Leslie Knope,I have some ideas.
Tom Haverford,These are our current park rangers.
Tom Haverford,What are they up to?
Tom Haverford,No one cares.
Tom Haverford,"They're boring, and I hate them."
Tom Haverford,But coming this spring to the style network Ranger Reality Show.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, tom, but Chris, he just wanted us I mean, really, you've gone way off track."
Tom Haverford,"Well, guess what, Jerry?"
Tom Haverford,I'm a dreamer.
Tom Haverford,Okay?
Tom Haverford,I dream big.
Tom Haverford,Deal with it.
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, weekends are for dreaming."
Jerry Gergich,You are a government worker.
Jerry Gergich,This is a government job.
Jerry Gergich,Plus isn't dreaming big exactly what got you in trouble with your old company?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where you going, Joe?"
Extra,Bathroom break.
Leslie Knope,"No, get back over there."
Leslie Knope,I'll find you a bottle or something.
Chris Traeger,Where did all these people come from?
Chris Traeger,And why did they turn so quickly on this project?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know how it goes."
Leslie Knope,It only takes one nut job to get people riled up.
Leslie Knope,"I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna have to do that environmental impact report."
Leslie Knope,They are explicitly demanding it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, everybody, listen up."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, in response to your complaints, we are cancelling all of these disruptive events."
Ben Wyatt,"This park is just gonna be a quiet patch of grass, harming nobody."
Ben Wyatt,Everybody cool?
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Chris Traeger,Dream team.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, Chris, I know you think that we're a dream team"
Chris Traeger,Dream team!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,But we're not.
Ben Wyatt,"You see, Leslie here is a team of one."
Ben Wyatt,"And that might be a very good team, but she kind of steamrolls the rest of her team, me, to do whatever she wants."
Ben Wyatt,"Regardless of how the rest of her team, me, feels."
Ben Wyatt,So I don't think we should work together anymore.
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Chris Traeger,That was very hard to hear.
Chris Traeger,So many negative words.
Chris Traeger,I just need to process this.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, the dream team is dead."
Chris Traeger,But you guys had a great run.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, and the park is open."
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Chris Traeger,Good job with that.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello ma'am, who is just as equal as man, I would like one ticket for, uh, women."
April Ludgate,He would like to register for Women's studies.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Here's the registration form.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Extra,And we'll need a check or money order for $940.
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,Why didn't you tell me it was so expensive?
April Ludgate,I didn't know.
April Ludgate,My parents pay for my classes.
April Ludgate,I'll just have them pay for yours too.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God, no!"
Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.
Andy Dwyer,I know.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna beg for money in the street like a drug addict.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Leslie Knope,Everything in my life is going wrong right now.
Leslie Knope,Whose fault is this?
Leslie Knope,I demand to know.
Ann Perkins,Actually 
Leslie Knope,Ben thinks that I'm a steamroller?
Leslie Knope,That's unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,How dare he think that I'm a steamroller?
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I'm just telling you this"
Leslie Knope," I know, he's going through a phase right now, and eventually we're gonna both be friends again."
Ann Perkins,"No, what I was gonna say is that you really are"
Leslie Knope,Working too hard.
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, you keep starting all these sentences and not finishing"
Ann Perkins, You're a steamroller!
Ann Perkins,"You are a massive, enormous, runaway steamroller with no brakes and a cement brick on the gas pedal."
Ann Perkins,You made me watch all eight Harry Potter movies.
Ann Perkins,I don't even like Harry Potter.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,You love Harry Potter.
Leslie Knope,You've seen all eight movies!
Ann Perkins,"When we go out to a bar, you order my drinks for me."
Leslie Knope,"Because you order white wine, and it gives you a headache."
Ann Perkins,"Well, it's my headache!"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you do what you want, you ignore what other people want, and you hear only what you want to hear."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I know I do this.
Leslie Knope,I'm the worst.
Ann Perkins,"No, you're very passionate."
Ann Perkins,You just push too hard sometimes.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should call me a bulldozer rather than a steamroller."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ann Perkins,It's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Leslie Knope,"Honestly, is it?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess I just need to leave Ben alone."
Leslie Knope,That's what he says he wants.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this steamroller is hanging up her The rolly thing on the front of the machine."
Leslie Knope,What do you what do you call that?
Ann Perkins,The roller?
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Got you a little pickmeup, Tommy."
Jerry Gergich,A tripledecker ham and cheese from the cafeteria.
Jerry Gergich,Always makes me feel better.
Tom Haverford,Two pathetic guys eating pathetic sandwiches.
Tom Haverford,Sounds terrific.
Tom Haverford,I guess I'm Jerry now.
Tom Haverford,"After work, I'll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a homecooked meal with my three beautiful daughters."
Tom Haverford,What a miserable life.
Jerry Gergich,"I have been here, well, 30 some years, and the best way to cope with this job is to do everything the exact same way every day."
Jerry Gergich,"Heck, I still use my original I.D. card from my first day on the job."
Jerry Gergich,Check this out.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I got to go.
Tom Haverford,Put my sammie in the fridge.
April Ludgate,"Mouse Rat CD, 30 dollars."
April Ludgate,"Candy bars, 50 dollars."
April Ludgate,50 dollars.
April Ludgate,"God, people here are so cheap."
Ron Swanson,"April, where have you been?"
Ron Swanson,Over two phone calls came in unimpeded.
Andy Dwyer,"We're raising money for my college education, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,I took a second job back at my old job.
Andy Dwyer,Do you want a shoe shine?
April Ludgate,It's 100 dollars.
April Ludgate,"Laugh all you want, Kyle."
April Ludgate,I already took the money out of your wallet.
Kyle,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"Good news, son."
Ron Swanson,You have just won a Ron Swanson scholarship.
Andy Dwyer,I don't think so.
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember applying for
April Ludgate,"No, Andy."
April Ludgate,Ron Swanson Scholarship.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, are you serious?"
Ron Swanson,Stop this.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Ron Swanson,"Stop, or you lose the money."
Ron Swanson,Why not?
Ron Swanson,"I like the kid, and I have the money."
Ron Swanson,One thing I promised myself when I buried gold in my backyard was that I'd never be a hoarder or a miser about it.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, is this health department business or Leslie business?"
Ann Perkins,You need to go talk to her.
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Ben Wyatt,So she can force me to spend time with her again?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,I'm done talking.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know she can be strong willed and difficult, okay?"
Ann Perkins,She once made me eat an entire cheesecake at a potluck so she didn't look bad.
Ann Perkins,But I really think she's ready to listen.
Ben Wyatt,You ate an entire cheesecake?
Ben Wyatt,Why didn't you just throw it away?
Ann Perkins,"Because with everything she's done for me, I would eat ten cheesecakes for her."
Ann Perkins,"Also, P.S."
Ann Perkins,"it was delicious and amazing, like everything she does."
Ann Perkins,Will you please just talk to her?
Ann Perkins,For my sake?
Ann Perkins,"I don't have unlimited texting, and when she can't talk to you, she texts me."
Tom Haverford," So we take the old logo from the 1970s, and we make limited edition hats, posters, tshirts, everything."
Tom Haverford," People love limited editions, plus parents will get swept up in the nostalgia and want to go to the parks to recreate the fun they had growing up."
Chris Traeger, This is amazing.
Chris Traeger, It is possibly the best idea anyone has had in this government in 100 years.
Chris Traeger," Tom, terrific."
Tom Haverford," Thanks, but most of the credit goes to my number-four, Jerry."
Tom Haverford," He shared some words of wisdom with me today, and while he was yammering on about whatever, I happened to see his old ID card."
Tom Haverford," Thanks, buddy."
Jerry Gergich, Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Leslie Knope, I wasn't sure you were gonna come.
Ben Wyatt," Well, I got very curious when you only left me one voicemail message, instead of your usual 20."
Leslie Knope, I'm trying to be a little less intense and a little more considerate.
Leslie Knope," Here, have a seat."
Leslie Knope, But only if you want to.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt, I want to.
Leslie Knope," I never listened to what you wanted, or how you wanted us to be when things Ended between us."
Leslie Knope," I just decided what I wanted, and I got upset when you didn't want the same thing."
Leslie Knope," I know that's not fair, and I'm very sorry."
Ben Wyatt," Well, thank you."
Ben Wyatt, I appreciate that.
Leslie Knope," If you don't want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand."
Ben Wyatt, I I don't want that.
Ben Wyatt, Really.
Ben Wyatt, But I just think it's for the best.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Leslie Knope, There is another option.
Leslie Knope," We could just say ""screw it"" and do this thing for real."
Ben Wyatt, What?
Leslie Knope, I miss you like crazy.
Leslie Knope, I think about you all the time.
Leslie Knope, I want to be with you.
Leslie Knope," So let's just say ""screw it."""
Ben Wyatt,"No, we would have to tell Chris."
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Ben Wyatt, It could turn into a scandal.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,It could hurt your campaign.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, how would you imagine we do this?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope," But I know how I feel, and I want to be with you."
Leslie Knope, But I'm done steamrolling people.
Leslie Knope, This is how I feel.
Leslie Knope, How do you feel?
Ron Swanson,First day.
Ron Swanson, You ready?
Andy Dwyer,As ready as I'll ever be.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, crap, I forgot my books."
Andy Dwyer, And my computer.
Ron Swanson, Just pay attention to the lecture and enjoy.
Ron Swanson," My first day of college, my father dropped me off at the steel mill."
Ron Swanson, He didn't think I should go to college.
Ron Swanson," But I hitched a ride, enrolled, and learned a lot."
Ron Swanson, I hope Andy does too.
Andy Dwyer," We need to start teaching women football, teaching women U.F.C. , teaching them to drive trucks without crashing."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, maybe I'm only sexy."
Andy Dwyer," Then-- maybe that's all you see, but at least you can give me extra money."
Andy Dwyer, Tip money and stuff.
Andy Dwyer," I'll flirt with you, write my name on a napkin."
Andy Dwyer,"They're gonna do it in a right, kind of legal way that empowers prostitution."
Andy Dwyer, We don't rest until we get that.
Andy Dwyer, That will be progress.
Linda Lonegan, That is extremely incorrect.
Andy Dwyer," I thought I thought maybe it was when I was I, uh I'll get 'em next time."
Andy Dwyer," Back to you, Professor."

Ron Swanson,April!
Ron Swanson,"Listen, I was trying to buy this handcrafted mahogany wood model of a B25 Mitchell Panchito aircraft."
April Ludgate,"Aw, for me?"
Ron Swanson,Don't sass me.
Ron Swanson,"And I went to this website, and this ad popped up that said ""Hey, Ron Swanson!"""
Ron Swanson,"""Check out this great offer."""
April Ludgate,What's your question?
Ron Swanson,"My question is, what the hell?"
April Ludgate,"Like, how did they know who you are?"
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Um, there are these things called cookies, where, like you go to a site and buy something, it'll remember you and then create ads for other stuff you might want to buy."
Ron Swanson,So it learns information?
Ron Swanson,About me?
Ron Swanson,That seems like an invasion of privacy.
April Ludgate,"Dude, if you think that's bad, go to Google Earth and type in your address."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, Ben and I have been dating on and off for about a year."
Chris Traeger,"I am, of course, shocked And not just because Ben usually prefers tall brunettes."
Ben Wyatt,We're very sorry for the position this puts you in.
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,"Are you hugging me, or are we fighting?"
Leslie Knope,Are you hugging or fighting?
Leslie Knope,Let me know.
Chris Traeger,Neither of those things.
Chris Traeger,I love both of you.
Chris Traeger,You are exemplary government employees.
Leslie Knope,"""Exemplary""?"
Leslie Knope,That's the word we were thinking of.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's true."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it?
Chris Traeger,Which makes what I'm about to say even sadder.
Leslie Knope,Then don't say it.
Chris Traeger,I'm launching a full investigation into the extent of your wrongdoing.
Chris Traeger,Please report Monday first thing to the council chambers for your ethics trial and subsequent punishment.
Ben Wyatt,I told you we'd feel better.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,It's 6:30 in the morning.
Ben Wyatt,Your hearing doesn't start for another two hours.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to get here early, you know, get a feel of the room."
Leslie Knope,So you got here at 3:00 A.M.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't sleep anyway.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I wanted to sneak in before you got here an absurd pipe dream I now realize was impossible."
Leslie Knope,Is that a present for me?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,What do you think?
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I had him made for you at the toy store."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thank you so much for making my life so wonderful."
Ben Wyatt,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,I was talking to him.
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
Leslie Knope,But also to you.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,I wish we could go through this together.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, it's going to be okay."
Ben Wyatt,"You're just gonna get a slap on the wrist, maybe a brief suspension."
Leslie Knope,That's not okay.
Leslie Knope,That's gonna go on my permanent record.
Leslie Knope,I'm not the kind of person that has a permanent record.
Leslie Knope,"For me, a slap on the wrist is like a kick to the nuts."
Ben Wyatt,I know it is.
Leslie Knope,What's gonna happen to you?
Ben Wyatt,Don't worry about me.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, look, I'll be outside all day, right on the other side of that wall."
Ben Wyatt,"So, if you miss me, you just look at this Wrinkled, hideous monster and you'll know I'm sitting there  rooting for you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,Go.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Marcus Everett Langley was Pawnee's greatest lawyer at the turn of the century.
Leslie Knope,"His nickname was ""Old Stone Face"" because of his steely demeanor and because he got in an accident at the rock quarry and dynamite blew up his face."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Chris Traeger,Good morning!
Chris Traeger,It is snowing outside.
Chris Traeger,Isn't that great?
Leslie Knope,You seem like you're in a good mood.
Chris Traeger,"Actually, I'm quite miserable."
Chris Traeger,"I admire and respect you, and dragging you through an ethics trial is filling me with sadness."
Chris Traeger,I have never felt so low.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're radiating pure joy."
Chris Traeger,I went to my herbalist and got two B12 shots.
Chris Traeger,"And then I ate an unreasonable amount of St. John's wort, and my herbalist took this weird bee pollen paste rubbed it around my gums."
Chris Traeger,And now my mouth feels like a spaceship.
Chris Traeger,This is stressful.
Chris Traeger,And stress leads to depression.
Chris Traeger,"And if I don't mantain an extremely high dosages of herbal remedies, I will get very depressed."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,It's happening right now.
Extra,"We are here today to determine whether Leslie Knope violated any municipal rules or laws due to her romantic relationship with her superior Ben Wyatt, whose hearing will be held tomorrow."
Extra,Would you like to make a statement at this time?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"I freely admit to the relationship, and I will not be fighting the charges that we violated Chris' rule."
Leslie Knope,But we did nothing else wrong or unethical.
Leslie Knope,"In 1849, Sarah Nelson Quindle exposed her elbow outdoors, which was a class ""A"" felony."
Leslie Knope,"Although she felt the law unjust, she acknowledged that she had broken it, and she nobly accepted her punishment to be set adrift on Lake Michigan like a human popsicle."
Leslie Knope,Look how calm she looks.
Leslie Knope,That's how I feel totally zen.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Knope, on what day did your relationship with Ben Wyatt begin?"
Leslie Knope,"Last May, at your request, Ben and I drove to Indianapolis to bid for the state little league tournament."
Leslie Knope,The night we returned was the first time we kissed each other on each other's mouths.
Leslie Knope,It was excellent.
Leslie Knope,That was unnecessary to add.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm nervous.
Chris Traeger,Next question did you ever receive special treatment as a result of your relationship with Ben Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,I received adorable nicknames and amazing back rubs.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you mean professionally."
Leslie Knope,No.
Chris Traeger,"And did you break any local, state, or federal law in an effort to cover up your relationship with Ben Wyatt?"
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Knope, that is all."
Extra,"Mr. Traeger, this says you're gonna be calling 14 witnesses."
Extra,Is that correct?
Chris Traeger,"Uh, yes, sir."
Leslie Knope,Why so many?
Leslie Knope,I've already admitted that I broke your rule.
Chris Traeger,"It's not my rule, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,It is an important rule that exists in every government.
Chris Traeger,"Romantic relationships between superiors and their employees lead to fraud, corruption, and misuse of public funds."
Leslie Knope,And you think I'm guilty of that?
Chris Traeger,I think that you began your relationship with Ben Wyatt earlier than you're saying.
Chris Traeger,"I believe that you certainly received special treatment, and I think that you may even be guilty of bribery."
Leslie Knope,None of those things are true.
Leslie Knope,"And I will prove it, Mr. Traeger."
Extra,"Okay, ten minute break please."
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, boss."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we need to counter every charge that Chris has leveled against me."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I need evidence."
Andy Dwyer,Got it!
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,You don't know what evidence.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, right on."
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Hit me.
Leslie Knope,Next to my desk is a picture of a female politician Bella Abzug.
Leslie Knope,Get the key that's taped to the back of that picture.
Leslie Knope,It opens up my bottom desk drawer in there are some files pay attention.
Leslie Knope,Where are you looking?
Leslie Knope,"Look here, focus here."
Leslie Knope,"Get the files in the drawer, and then get all the file boxes in the office."
Andy Dwyer,Put the files in the drawer.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'll go with him."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Chris has 14 witnesses."
Leslie Knope,I need you to talk to all the department heads and find out who's gonna testify.
Ron Swanson,I don't know the names of the other department heads.
Donna Meagle,I'll go with him.
Donna Meagle,Seriously?
Donna Meagle,With the men in this office?
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,I need you to text me every 30 seconds  that everything's gonna be okay.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann!"
Leslie Knope,"I broke one rule, and I will accept a slap on the wrist."
Leslie Knope,But when you sit back and let your reputation be destroyed.
Leslie Knope,You go down in history as a frozen whore.
Leslie Knope,I'm fighting.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, grab my computer."
Ann Perkins,I'm all set.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,You're up next.
Leslie Knope,How is Ben?
Leslie Knope,Is he sad?
Leslie Knope,"You need to cheer him up, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Ben is fine.
Ann Perkins,He says he's sorry he's not in here.
Ann Perkins,He said to look at the monster.
Ann Perkins,I'm hoping you know what that means.
Ron Swanson,There's a rumor going around that Chris has a killer witness.
Leslie Knope,How?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,That makes no sense.
Leslie Knope,"There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong unless someone's planning to lie or slander us."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him."
Ron Swanson,With pleasure.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Let me make it clear.
Leslie Knope,Don't silence him.
Leslie Knope,Just make sure he can't talk.
Extra,"Okay, we're back."
Extra,"Clear this chamber, please."
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Perkins, Chris Traeger has questioned when my relationship with Ben Wyatt began."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to direct you to your inbox and specifically an email entitled ""yay""."
Leslie Knope,"That's YA and 18 ""Y""s and 44 exclamation points."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, it is an email from you."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and there's an attachment."
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,Intriguing.
Leslie Knope,"Could you play the attachment, please?"
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Leslie Knope,In a world on the brink of financial meltdown... In a town unlike any other An adorable man with a cute face and the future president of the United States
Leslie Knope,what?
Leslie Knope,went from being friends to being so much more.
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Leslie Knope,Ben and I hooked up last night!
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,And I learned how to use iMovie.
Leslie Knope,Call me later!
Leslie Knope,Bye!
Leslie Knope,So what was the date you received that email?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, May 12th."
Leslie Knope,May 12th The day after we returned from Indianapolis.
Chris Traeger,"Mr. Haverford, would you consider Leslie Knope a good employee?"
Tom Haverford,Did Tom Ford turn around the House of Gucci?
Chris Traeger,"I do not know, but I'll assume that that is a yes."
Chris Traeger,How long were you two lovers?
Tom Haverford,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,"Last march, I witnessed Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford engaged in a passionate yet tender kiss."
Chris Traeger,It seems that Ms.
Chris Traeger,Knope has a pattern of becoming involved with her coworkers.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing?"
Tom Haverford,An online dating site randomly paired us up.
Tom Haverford,"So, as a joke, I thought it would be funny to pretend you and I were dating."
Tom Haverford,And then you kissed me as a joke To shut me up.
Leslie Knope,But we never had any other romantic contact after that.
Tom Haverford,"No, that would be like dating my older sister's elderly aunt."
Leslie Knope,"No, it wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we've been at it for hours."
Leslie Knope,And I did have some problem with my character witnesses.
April Ludgate,I don't know why Leslie Knope's on trial.
April Ludgate,Ethel Beavers did it!
April Ludgate,Beavers did it!
Extra,Sit down.
April Ludgate,I will hold myself in contempt of the court!
Andy Dwyer,Is this about the laptop?
Andy Dwyer,I didn't mean to steal it.
Andy Dwyer,"I took it home, and I spaced."
Andy Dwyer,I forgot.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna bring it back.
Andy Dwyer,"It totally works, but I got spaghetti in the keyboard."
Chris Traeger,What laptop?
Andy Dwyer,Objection.
Leslie Knope,"But other than that, I think I'm winning."
Leslie Knope,I've refuted every one of Chris' claims so far.
Chris Traeger,I have here a receipt from Pawnee Supersuites Motel.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope submitted that receipt for reimbursement.
Chris Traeger,Taxpayers' money is not meant to be spent on a romantic getaway.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, will you please describe what we were wearing the evening you saw us?"
Donna Meagle,"Um, khakis and buttondown shirts your basic white people clothes."
Leslie Knope,"And when you walked into the room, what did it look like?"
Leslie Knope,Did it look like anything romantic had happened?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, no."
Donna Meagle,"I have ruined my share of hotel rooms, and trust me, nothing sexual happened in that room."
Donna Meagle,It kind of looked like an office.
Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was an office.
Leslie Knope,"City Hall was being fumigated, and we need to pull an allnighter."
Leslie Knope,The only thing that was ravaged were these federal grant proposals that Donna had dropped off earlier.
Leslie Knope,"I've seen over 200 episodes of Law & Order, and it's paying off bigtime."
Leslie Knope,"And by the way, we got the gramps grants."
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,It was gonna be such an awesome moment.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ethel, you've been to a million of these ethics trials."
Leslie Knope,What do you think my chances are?
Ethel Beavers,I'd say it's 50/50.
Ethel Beavers,"You want to put money on it, I'll give you 60/40 against."
Leslie Knope,Is it ethical for a court stenographer to bet on the outcome of a hearing?
Ethel Beavers,You tell me.
Ethel Beavers,You're the one on trial.
Extra,"Ron Swanson to the stand, please."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Swanson, there has been a question posed about when my relationship with Ben Wyatt ended."
Leslie Knope,Can you confirm that you own a cabin  at 930 
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,"Stop, please."
Ron Swanson,"I don't like to give out my address to anyone, much less have it on an official record."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, don't be ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,This is very important.
Leslie Knope,Do you own a cabin 
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Leslie Knope,9301 Cedarcrest Drive
Ron Swanson,Beep!
Ethel Beavers,I didn't hear that.
Ron Swanson,She's here.
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Ron Swanson,My exwife Tammy two.
Ron Swanson,I can smell the sulfur coming off her cloven hooves.
Chris Traeger,"Good nose, Ron."
Chris Traeger,Tammy Swanson is here.
Chris Traeger,She'll be my next witness.
Leslie Knope,Tammy two is your killer witness?
Leslie Knope,Please!
Leslie Knope,"You're gonna have to do better Actually, she is a terrifying sociopath who could say or do anything A pretty good killer witness."
Chris Traeger,"Ms. Swanson, do you, as you claimed, have evidence linking Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt to law breaking?"
Tammy 2,Absolutely.
Tammy 2,I have several photographs that will definitively prove
Chris Traeger,"May I remind you that you are under oath, and if you lie, I will fire you and have you prosecuted."
Tammy 2,Nothing.
Tammy 2,They will definitively prove nothing.
Tammy 2,You cut me off.
Tammy 2,I don't have any evidence.
Tammy 2,"Oh, Chris so silly."
Tammy 2,"Okay, bye, guys."
Tammy 2,"Leslie, have fun with this trial."
Tammy 2,Yay!
Leslie Knope,I think I've proven that the only rule Ben and I broke was dating each other.
Chris Traeger,And I am very happy that I have not uncovered any additional evidence of unethical behavior.
Chris Traeger,But II do have one last witness George Williams from Public Works.
Leslie Knope,George Williams?
Leslie Knope,"Who's Oh, George Williams He's just a maintenance worker, NASCAR enthusiast, I believe."
Leslie Knope,"And, oh, interesting tidbit I once bribed him to keep my relationship with Ben quiet."
Chris Traeger,You're saying that you saw Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope kissing at Li'l Sebastian's memorial?
George Williams,Yeah!
Chris Traeger,Can you identify Leslie Knope in this chamber?
George Williams,She's right there.
Leslie Knope,Right
Chris Traeger,And what happened after this incident?
George Williams,"Well, I got real nervous."
George Williams,"They came up to me, and they told me to forget what I saw."
Leslie Knope,What you saw was not what you think it is.
Leslie Knope,"I have a gift certificate, actually, for you."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
George Williams,And then they gave me a $50 gift certificate to a spa and said
Leslie Knope,And thank you for your discretion.
Chris Traeger,And did you use it?
George Williams,Yeah.
George Williams,I got a facial.
George Williams,My wife said my skin was luminous.
Chris Traeger,That's enough.
Chris Traeger,"Now, in order to cover up their illicit affair, Ben Wyatt and Leslie Knope bribed a city employee."
Leslie Knope,"George, I notice that you're wearing glasses, yet on the day in question, I don't recall you wearing glasses."
Leslie Knope,Could it be because you weren't wearing glasses?
George Williams,I never wear 'em on the job.
Leslie Knope,"Can you take your glasses off, please, and read this for us?"
George Williams,"""I could read this if I weren't so blind."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, that went terribly."
Leslie Knope,I need to check some facts and figures.
Leslie Knope,I would like to request a 55 day recess.
Extra,"You can have 30 minutes, but we're nearing the end here, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, my only hope is that in one of these old books, there's some weird, arcane statute or government rule that helps me."
Leslie Knope,"So everybody grab a volume, and let's just read up."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, mine doesn't have any pictures."
Leslie Knope,Does anyone have anything?
Leslie Knope,Did anybody find anything good?
Ron Swanson,"In 1856, the city council banned all sexual positions except for missionary."
Ron Swanson,"And two years later, they banned missionary."
Tom Haverford,"1882, should a Presbyterian speak out of turn, he may be caned across the shinbone."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,Black people still can't legally use city sidewalks.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we're not supposed to be seen together, but I think Ben could be really helpful with this."
Leslie Knope,Can somebody go get him?
Donna Meagle,"All right, I'll go."
April Ludgate,"""Any woman caught laughing is a witch."""
April Ludgate,That's true.
Donna Meagle,"Um, he's not there."
Leslie Knope,"No, he said he'd just be on the other side of that wall."
Leslie Knope,He's probably in the bathroom.
Donna Meagle,"All right, I'll find him."
Leslie Knope,"This mural is called Bad Pawnee, Good Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,All the terrible things that have happened in this town's history are on one side.
Leslie Knope,And on the other side are all the good things that have happened.
Leslie Knope,I'm on the bad side.
Ron Swanson,"No, you're not."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I'm guilty.
Leslie Knope,I did something bad.
Leslie Knope,I'm a bad person.
Ron Swanson,It's not that simple.
Ron Swanson,You know what makes a good person good?
Ron Swanson,"When a good person does something bad, they own up to it."
Ron Swanson,"They try to learn something from it, and they move on."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, everybody stop reading no more loopholes, no more fighting."
Andy Dwyer,"Are you sure, boss?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I know I let you down.
Leslie Knope,And I just want to say I'm really sorry.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, what are you talking about?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, this makes me like you more."
Tom Haverford,Bribing someone to hide a sexcapade I'm proud to call you a friend.
Andy Dwyer,And I always liked you.
Extra,"Okay, we're back."
Extra,"Clear the chamber, please."
Leslie Knope,"I think I'm about to get fired, Ron."
Extra,"Ms. Knope, unless you have any objections, we'll be ending this investigation and moving on to the punishment phase."

Jerry Gergich,"On my first day here, the old director, he called me Jerry, and I just didn't think I should correct him."

Leslie Knope,It's so nice to be able to sit here in public  and have breakfast with you.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"In a way, my suspension from work was kind of a blessing."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I feel the same way about resigning in disgrace."
Leslie Knope,"Totally, the key is you have to keep yourself busy, or else you're gonna go crazy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at me, look how busy I am."
Leslie Knope,"I'm inventing a new spice called ""salgar."""
Leslie Knope,"It's part salt, part sugar."
Ben Wyatt,What could that possibly be good on?
Leslie Knope,Butterscotch pudding.
Ben Wyatt,Fair enough.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have to go to this meeting with my advisers."
Leslie Knope,"You have a big day, right?"
Leslie Knope,Which interview is this?
Ben Wyatt,"It's a job doing inhouse accounting work for an accounting firm, so could be pretty interesting."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, sounds interesting."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, if I hadn't resigned in disgrace, I might never have explored the private sector."
Ben Wyatt,"It's like, why didn't I resign in disgrace 12 years ago?"
Leslie Knope,"You might want to stop saying ""resigned in disgrace."""
Leslie Knope,Especially during job interviews.
Ben Wyatt,Good call.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie wishes she could be here herself to give you these presents, but she's suspended."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and also she said that they're not from her,  they're from Santa Claus."
Andy Dwyer,Can I go first?
Andy Dwyer,"Mouse Rat, certified gold!"

Donna Meagle,"And on the back, in rhinestones ""You can get it""!"
Tom Haverford,"I know you're sad you couldn't get tickets to the ""Watch the Throne"" tour, so I got you a watch and a tiny throne instead."
Tom Haverford,"And check it out, she even took out the dumb clock part and put this in ""Baller Time."""
April Ludgate,These are the Blackeyed Peas.
April Ludgate,And I finally killed them.
April Ludgate,It's a Christmas miracle.
Ron Swanson,"Every year, I give Leslie the same present I give everyone: A crisp $20 bill."
Ron Swanson,"And every year, she gets me something thoughtful and personal."
Ron Swanson,It makes me furious.
Ron Swanson,"This year, she outdid herself."
Ron Swanson,She had it installed over the weekend.
Ron Swanson,It's so It's so beautiful.
Ron Swanson,We need to get Leslie something that erases the enormous emotional debt that has built up over years of this gift giving imbalance.
Ron Swanson,Everyone start thinking of ideas.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, jeez."
Jerry Gergich,Socks.
Jerry Gergich,She gets me.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, hi, hi, hi."
Leslie Knope,Sorry I'm late.

William Barnes,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"And Elizabeth, I got you a Knope 2012 Menorah Maybe?"
Elizabeth Barnes,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, okay."
Leslie Knope,Then I got you a tree ornament.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's talk about damage control."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I could go on Pawnee Today, but and I know this is a long shot Oprah has her own network now."
Elizabeth Barnes,"Whoa, Leslie, slow down."
William Barnes,"The first step is for us to figure out what we're up against, and we've already got polls out in the field, and we should have results back in a couple of days."
William Barnes,"Just stay out of the spotlight until we can figure out just how this, uh, incident has affected the voters."
Elizabeth Barnes,"Sit tight, take a beat, relax."
Leslie Knope,"""Sit tight""?"
Leslie Knope,"""Take a beat""?"
Leslie Knope,"""Relax""?"
Leslie Knope,I don't really do any of those things.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, while I was in that meeting, I was also planning my mother's birthday party in my head."
Leslie Knope,Strawberry margaritas!
Leslie Knope,Another use for salgar!
Barney,"Financial analysis, automated general ledger accounting systems, audit management."
Barney,"Hmm, you've done everything."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they call me ""the Swiss Army Accountant."""
Ben Wyatt,They don't call me that.
Barney,They should.
Barney,"Well, look, I think you'd be a great addition."
Barney,Would you be willing to come back to meet the division head?
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, absolutely."
Barney,We'll set that up.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, uh Calc you later."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you like that one, huh?"
Barney,"We do not get a lot of humor here, and when we do, it's wonderful."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Barney,Ted!
Barney,Come in here!
Barney,Say it to Ted when he comes in.
April Ludgate,We could get Leslie some marshmallow fluff.
April Ludgate,I have some right here.
Andy Dwyer,"Correction, darling."
Andy Dwyer,You had some right here.
April Ludgate,Did you just scoop it out of the jar with your hand like a bear?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,I can't get it off.
Andy Dwyer,Can you help me?
Tom Haverford,Behold!
Tom Haverford,My latest attempt to drag this department into the 20th century.
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, it's the 21st century."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,I'd settle for getting you into the 20th.
Tom Haverford,"I fed all of Leslie's emails, letters, and memos into a program and generated A word cloud."
Tom Haverford,This is how we can get gift ideas.
Tom Haverford,"The more she's mentioned a word, the larger it appears."
Ron Swanson,"""Ben"" And much larger, ""Ann."""
Ron Swanson,She definitely loves Ann.
Ann Perkins,Aww.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I have an idea.
Ron Swanson,I will build a small wood model of the parks department.
Ron Swanson,We can decorate our offices as they are in real life.
Ron Swanson,It will be  Cute.
Ann Perkins,Wait!
Ann Perkins,Better idea: We make a gingerbread version of the office.
Andy Dwyer,That's so good!
Ron Swanson,I think the wood model is best
Ann Perkins,and we can decorate our offices with candy canes and gumdrops!
Jerry Gergich,That would be so adorable!
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Ron!"
Ann Perkins,That's such a cute idea!
Ron Swanson,I have some great red birch with a nice spalting.
Ron Swanson,I already have some scale wainscoting.
Ben Wyatt,"Mmm, I love me a calzone."
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Leslie Knope,I'm going crazy!
Leslie Knope,"First, they won't let me work in the parks department, now they won't let me campaign either."
Leslie Knope,"All I want to do is improve our town, and they won't let me do that!"
Ben Wyatt,You're putting an awful lot of salgar on your pasta.
Leslie Knope,This is just sugar.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need you to distract me."
Leslie Knope,Talk to me about something.
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that accounting firm is gonna make me a job offer."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna take it?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it pays well."
Ben Wyatt,"The commute is a little long, but that's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"I didn't love the carpeting, but eh."
Leslie Knope,You know what I think?
Leslie Knope,"If you don't love it, take a month."
Leslie Knope,See what else is out there.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"And, you know, you can still improve the city."
Ben Wyatt,"You can't work right now, or run a campaign."
Ben Wyatt,Do it as a private citizen.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I'll form a citizen action committee, I'll lobby from the outside, I'll harness the power of the community."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I finally have some work to do."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for dinner, honey."
Ben Wyatt,"I can hear you breathing, and, yes, you can finish her pasta."
Andy Dwyer,Thank God.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so hungry.
Andy Dwyer,"Mmm, it tastes like froot loops."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Great turn out.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Parks Committee of Pawnee, or PCP."
Extra,"Um, should we really be called ""PCP""?"
Leslie Knope,"See, because  Yes, because, like the drug PCP, we are so fast acting and powerful, we should be illegal."
Leslie Knope,"Now, what do you want to see fixed in the parks?"
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Extra,I've noticed that the White Hills hiking path could really use some upkeep.
Extra,I was thinking we organize a letterwriting campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, II know for a fact that nobody in the parks department reads letters, except for one person, who is amazing, but she isn't currently there, because he was suspended."
Extra,How amazing can he be if he got suspended?
Leslie Knope,"Pretty damn amazing, Diane."
Leslie Knope,Now shush.
Leslie Knope,"If we want to get the government off their bloated, bureaucratic butts, then we need our voices to be heard, and that's what we're gonna do."
Leslie Knope,"Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose."
Ann Perkins,"Ron is making the model, and then we're going to put all of our candy decorations in our corners of the office."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so what did everybody make?"
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,Rock n' roll candy Andy.
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Ron Swanson,"That's really good, son."
Ron Swanson,I didn't do anything for my office.
April Ludgate,"It's okay, I took care of it."
April Ludgate,I made a marshmallow Ron Swanson.
April Ludgate,See?
April Ludgate,His arms are crossed because he's mad at all the other marshmallow workers for annoying him.
April Ludgate,You like it?
Ron Swanson,It's fine.
Tom Haverford,"When I was trying to decide how to decorate my office, I had to ask myself, ""what kind of candy should I choose?"""
Tom Haverford,"Obviously chocolate, 'cause I'm sweet, smooth, and the ladies love me."
Tom Haverford,"Now the question still remained, ""what kind of chocolate am I?"""
Tom Haverford,"Do I have a little gooey, caramel center?"
Tom Haverford,Am I filled with little rice krispies?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'm white chocolate and I'm bucking all the stereotypes.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, just put your damn candy out."
Tom Haverford,"Ultimately, I decided to go with a little gourmet fudge."
Tom Haverford,"I didn't have time to make it into anything, and please don't eat it 'cause it cost $55 an ounce."
Donna Meagle,So I made my desk out of silver m&ms.
Donna Meagle,"But they do not make silver m&ms, so I spraypainted them."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, those are poisonous, so no one eat them."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, duh."
Ann Perkins,Go throw up.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't eat any.
Ann Perkins,Go throw up.
April Ludgate,Throw up.

Dennis Feinstein,This cologne company is my life's work.
Dennis Feinstein,Why should I trust you with my perfumery?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, uh, I've been in government accounting for more than a decade, and I just think it's time for a change."
Dennis Feinstein,"Listen, Ben, I'm gonna cut right to the chase, okay?"
Dennis Feinstein,I like you I've always liked you but I also like Eddie.
Ben Wyatt,Ed who who's Eddie?
Dennis Feinstein,"Eddie's my current CFO, but I might fire him and hire you."
Dennis Feinstein,You got kids?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Dennis Feinstein,That's good.
Dennis Feinstein,Dumdum Eddie has two kids.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Don't fire Eddie.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you have him in here in this interview?
Ben Wyatt,"Eddie, I am sorry"
Dennis Feinstein, Don't talk to Eddie.
Dennis Feinstein,"Treat him like you would treat a person in another country that you paid $25,000 to hunt."
Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?
Dennis Feinstein,What am I talking about?
Dennis Feinstein,I'm talking about the best vacation of my life.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm sorry."

Jerry Gergich,"Okay, are there any more recommendations for new games at the rec center?"
Extra,"My daughter, she loves chutes and ladders."
Chance Frenlm,"Oh, come on!"

Chance Frenlm,"Well, your daughter is an idiot."
Chance Frenlm,Her daughter is an idiot!
Chance Frenlm,Her daughter is an idiot!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Chance Frenlm,Her daughter is an idiot!
Leslie Knope,"No, no she's not."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I represent the PCP."
Leslie Knope,We have a list of six demands.
Leslie Knope,Here they are in alphabetical order.
Leslie Knope,Number one: Ants.
Leslie Knope,Too many ants in the teen center.
Leslie Knope,Number two: Tennis court improvements.
Leslie Knope,Number three
Jerry Gergich," Well, Les-- um, ma'am, uh, this public forum, it is just about improvements that we can make to the rec center."
Leslie Knope,"Speaking of which, the fact that yahtzee is not in the rec center is a tragedy on par with human trafficking."
Leslie Knope,Slight exaggeration Getting back to our demands.
Leslie Knope,We will not be muzzled like a rabid dog.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take this all the way to the top.
Extras,Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we have made some waves here, people, but we need to keep this momentum going."
Leslie Knope,"Now, the city manager's name is Chris Traeger."
Leslie Knope,I want to take this fight to him.
Extra,"Ooh, a letterwriting campaign!"
Leslie Knope,"God, Diane, will you stop it with the letterwriting campaign?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I have his office number.
Leslie Knope,I want one of you calling it every 15 minutes.
Leslie Knope,"We are also going to protest along his jogging route, and I need someone in every GNC within a fivemile radius  of the city center."
Leslie Knope,But there are only 12 of us.
Extra,13
Leslie Knope,Look!
Leslie Knope,Our numbers are growing!
Leslie Knope,"There's nothing we can't do if we work hard, never sleep, and shirk all other responsibilities in our lives."
Leslie Knope,You with me?
Ron Swanson,"I can handcraft 17 foot canoes out of western red cedar, but I can't glue two damn Graham crackers together!"
Andy Dwyer,"Look, it's really easy."
Andy Dwyer,I know a lot about candy.
Andy Dwyer,"I play with it, I eat it."
Andy Dwyer,Sometimes I play with it and eat it.
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Ron Swanson,"Okay, new plan."
Ron Swanson,"Everyone else makes this candy house, and I make myself useful elsewhere."
Extra,Your 11:00 is here.
Leslie Knope,Concerned citizen and community leader Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,You're not supposed to be here.
Leslie Knope,"As a government employee, that's true, but I am just here as a concerned citizen and founder of PCP."
Leslie Knope,The Parks Committee of Pawnee.
Chris Traeger,Those are the people that have been harassing me.
Leslie Knope,We have many demands.
Leslie Knope,"Specifically, these six unfunded projects that need to be dealt with immediately."
Chris Traeger,Well
Leslie Knope,Not good enough!
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, out of respect for you, I will meet with your group, but I hope that this puts an end to the madness."
Leslie Knope,Prepare for battle.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, I got your Christmas present."
Leslie Knope,It's like a little stopwatch that records your jogging times and then sends it to your computer via Bluetooth.
Chris Traeger,Ahh!
Chris Traeger,That is so thoughtful!
Leslie Knope,Aww.
Leslie Knope,My pleasure.
Leslie Knope,See you in hell!
William Barnes,"Well, I see you've taken our advice about relaxing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is just a little militant citizen group I slapped together."
Leslie Knope,"But enough about me, what are my polling results?"
William Barnes,"Uh, well, before the scandal, you were at 26%."
William Barnes,"Now, we knew we'd take a hit, but we figured as long as we're at 15% or above, we're still in the fight."
Leslie Knope,And we're at 15%?
Leslie Knope,We went back to 26%?
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."
Leslie Knope,50%?
Elizabeth Barnes,We're at one.
Leslie Knope,One hundred?
William Barnes,You're polling at 1%.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That can't be right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, what we do is we move forward from this."
Leslie Knope,How do we put a positive spin on this?
Elizabeth Barnes,There's no way to spin this.
Leslie Knope,Sure there is.
Leslie Knope,You're looking at the glass like it's 99% empty.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking at it like it's 1% full.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the last delicious sip of a milkshake at the bottom of the metal milkshakey thing?"
William Barnes,It's very hard to come back from this kind of thing.
William Barnes,"You know, a sex scandal with your boss."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like you're so pure and chaste."
Leslie Knope,"Please, I know the two of you are sleeping together."
Leslie Knope,"It's obvious, with all your glances and your sly smiles."
Elizabeth Barnes,I'm gay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, never mind then."
William Barnes,It's a small town.
William Barnes,There's nowhere to hide.
William Barnes,We can't run your campaign anymore.
William Barnes,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
William Barnes,"You were a great candidate, butit's over."
Ann Perkins,Could you maybe find new advisors?
Leslie Knope,I can't.
Leslie Knope,I talked to everyone in the entire state who's ever run a campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Nobody wants a candidate who's polling  at ""last milkshake sip"" levels."
Ann Perkins,Can I say something?
Ann Perkins,"This sucks, I am not gonna convince you that it doesn't, and you can tell me every day for the next year  about how much this sucks."
Leslie Knope,One year you said one year.
Leslie Knope,That's on the record.
Ann Perkins,And I meant it.
Ann Perkins,But eventually this'll pass.
Ann Perkins,You're gonna get through this.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, I return to my old job in a week, and that's great because I love my old job, but My heart was really set on this new job."
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Don't touch my pickles, Ann!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,BbbbBenjammin'!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yeah, I know, I know, I know."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, JeanRalphio."
Ben Wyatt, How's it going?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," It's going good, I'm actually right here for an appointmt."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Getting a Brazilian.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," By the way, there's a woman over there that is unbelievable."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Her name is Kim.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," When she rips it off, she smiles, and it makes you feel things."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Throw my name, I get a referral discount."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,If you don't mind.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I heard somebody resigned in disgrace.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," My question to you is, how you making that paper?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, I've interviewed around, uh, but I'm actually about to take a job doing in-house accounting for an accounting firm."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I almost fell asleep during that sentence.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Let me get this straight.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, You would be an accountant For accountants?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," So at this accounting firm, you would have the boring job? Are you nuts? This is probably the first time you've had off since you've been kid president."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,True or false?
Ben Wyatt,True.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Why don't you use that time and go after one of your passions, like model trains or, like, or toy Gandalfs or something?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't know why you jumped straight to model trains.
Ben Wyatt, I mean it's accurate.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," I'm gonna tell you something that I once heard from a very, very smart woman named Kim."
Ben Wyatt,The lady who waxes you? 
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"She told me, ""if you don't love what you do Then why do it?"" Then she ripped the hair from my b-hole."
Chris Traeger," Ron filled me in on everything that happened, and I really wish that the ethics investigation hadn't interfered with your campaign in any way."
Leslie Knope, You don't have to apologize.
Leslie Knope, You were very fair.
Leslie Knope," In fact, I'm the one that needs to apologize."
Leslie Knope, I got you involved in PCP.
Leslie Knope," But I'm starting a new group now, LSD, Leslie's Sorry Division, and I just want to say I'm sorry, Chris."
Chris Traeger," Oh, that's nice of you to say."
Chris Traeger," Anyway, now, for your Christmas present."
Chris Traeger, Your suspension's been lifted.
Chris Traeger," Please, come back to work."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope," Hey, what are you doing here?"
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt," Uh, I just wanted to tell you something in person."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, I'm pregnant."
Leslie Knope," Wait, what? No, that's not it."
Ben Wyatt, I turned down that accounting job.
Ben Wyatt, Just didn't feel right.
Ben Wyatt," That's okay, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, I think that's great.
Leslie Knope,I'm really proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Yeah? What are you gonna do instead?
Ben Wyatt,I have no idea.
Leslie Knope,I like it.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, well, I guess I'll just see you at home."
Leslie Knope," Well, they're having a party in here."
Leslie Knope, Why don't you stay?
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, I think you should go in alone."
Leslie Knope,What's going on here?
Ann Perkins,"Merry Christmas, Leslie!"
Ann Perkins, We made you this replica of the parks department out of gingerbread.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, I love it! Aw, I love it, and I love you guys, and Ann specifically."
Leslie Knope, And all of you! You did all of this together?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, except for me."
Ron Swanson," Turns out, I cannot make a gingerbread house, which would bother me if I were an 8-year-old girl."
Ron Swanson," In any case, these people stepped up and helped me out, and that gave me another idea."
Ron Swanson," This is the city council chambers, and that's you, next may."
Leslie Knope, I don't understand.
Ann Perkins," Your campaign advisers quit, big deal."
Ann Perkins," You're running for city council again, Leslie, with our help."
April Ludgate," April Ludgate, youth outreach and director of new media."
Tom Haverford," Tom Haverford, image consultant, swagger coach."
Ann Perkins," Ann Perkins, office manager and volunteer coordinator."
Andy Dwyer," Andy Dwyer, security, sweets, body man."
Andy Dwyer," Javelin, if need be."
Donna Meagle," Donna Meagle, transpo, AKA rides in my Benz."
Jerry Gergich,you guys didn't tell me we were doing this.
Jerry Gergich," I, I did not know that I was supposed to come up with something."
Ron Swanson," I, Ron Swanson, any other damn thing you might need."
Leslie Knope," Guys, it's so much work."
Leslie Knope, I can't ask you to put your lives on hold.
Ron Swanson, Find one person here who you haven't helped by putting your life on hold.
Leslie Knope, I don't know what to say Except Let's go win an election! Giving Christmas gifts is like a sport to me.
Leslie Knope, Finding or making that perfect something.
Ron Swanson,Come on.
Leslie Knope,It's also like a sport to me because I always win.
Leslie Knope," This year, though? My friends won."
Leslie Knope," In fact, I got my ass handed to me."
Barney,"Welcome, Mr. Saperstein."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Thank you so much.
Barney, I will just show to your cubicle.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I can't wait.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," I bet it's a big one, huh Barney?"
Barney,"Um, the, uh, temp agency said that you are fluent with Quickbooks Pro, correct?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, right, yeah, we should cover that."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," You see, my resume might not actually be accurate, right? So I have no idea what you're talking about."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Don't know what Quickbooks are.
Barney, You don't have any accounting experience? 
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no, no, Barney, come on."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, But you don't have to be an accountant to know that this girl is a ten.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Yo, what up, D.S?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You come here often?
Extra,To my job?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Ooh, she got a mouth on her also."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shut it.
Extra,Is this the new temp who's supposed to help me with the spreadsheets? 
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You want to talk about spreading and sheets, we can go back to my place and I will rock your--"
Barney,You're fired!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That makes sense.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, So I just go out the same way I came in?

Leslie Knope,"Oh, goody, you're all here."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know I'm not supposed to talk about my campaign in the office, but last night I've made a decision about who should be my campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,This is a huge job.
Leslie Knope,"This is going to require a lot of late night, oneonone jam sessions with me, and we're going to bounce ideas off of each other, you're going to have to take calls for me, any time, day or night."
Leslie Knope,"The person I have chosen is, drum roll please, Ann Perkins!"
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Give it up for Ann!
Ron Swanson,Good choice.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, I don't know the first thing about running a political campaign."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you beautiful tropical fish."
Leslie Knope,You're smart as a whip and you're cool under pressure.
Leslie Knope,You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.
Ann Perkins,"No, I haven't."
Leslie Knope,You haven't?
Ann Perkins,No!
Leslie Knope,You will.
Leslie Knope,You're that good of a nurse.
Ann Perkins,What about Ben?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, he ran for mayor at 18 and won."
Leslie Knope,Ben is poison in my campaign.
Leslie Knope,Our relationship is the reason why my advisors pulled out.
Leslie Knope,"I  Ann, don't listen to your head or your heart."
Leslie Knope,"Just look at my eyes and say ""yes."""
Ann Perkins,"Okay, yes."
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"I believe in you, Ann."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,And your first job as my campaign manager is to start dressing like one.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to have this conversation again.
Ann Perkins,Again?
Ann Perkins,You just hired me eight seconds ago.
April Ludgate,Wow.
April Ludgate,You're doing a really bad job.
Leslie Knope,"William, Elizabeth."
William Barnes,"Leslie, hi."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,What are you Are you coming to see me?
Leslie Knope,Did you hear that I'm relaunching my campaign?
William Barnes,"Actually, no, sorry."
William Barnes,We weren't here to see you.
William Barnes,We've been meeting with other potential candidates for city council.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"So, my campaign ends and, just like that, you find someone else and run theirs?"
Elizabeth Barnes,"Yes, that's our job."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Good luck, but, uh, I just had a big meeting with my new advisory board, and they're brilliant and amazing."
Leslie Knope,They're real killers.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, I tried to make ramen in the coffee pot and I broke everything."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Andy."
Leslie Knope,I'll be right in.
William Barnes,"Well, uh, good luck, Leslie."
William Barnes,Honestly.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we don't need luck."
Leslie Knope,We are a rocket ship.
Leslie Knope,"We are relaunching, and we're going to blast past your cann Huh, they're gone."
Leslie Knope,"It's true I no longer have highly trained, professional campaign managers."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,"Are most murders committed by highly trained, professional assassins?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,They're committed by friends and coworkers.
Leslie Knope,That analogy was way better in my head.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
April Ludgate,Champion?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh my gosh, there you are, puppy."
Andy Dwyer,That's a good boy.
Ben Wyatt,That is a three legged dog.
Andy Dwyer,"His name is Champion, because he's the dog world champion."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I have to ask this, I'm sorry, but how many legs did that dog have when you found him?"
Andy Dwyer,Three!
Andy Dwyer,That's what makes him the best.
Andy Dwyer,He can do more with three legs than most dogs can do with four.
April Ludgate,Except for digging.
April Ludgate,He's really bad at digging.
Andy Dwyer,And you remember what you said about making decisions in the house?
Andy Dwyer,You want to be involved.
Andy Dwyer,"We get that, so You just say the word, and Champion goes back to the pound, where he can be put down and killed forever."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not gonna send a three legged dog to his death.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,But I'm not gonna take care of him for you.
April Ludgate,"Well, it would be nice if you helped a little."
April Ludgate,"Because, unlike you, Andy and I have jobs."
Ben Wyatt,"Cruel, but fair."
Ann Perkins,So Leslie and I have come up with the theme for the campaign relaunch rally.
Leslie Knope,"""The Comeback Kid."""
Ann Perkins,Everyone loves a good comeback story.
Ann Perkins,Rocky.
Leslie Knope,"Robert Downey, Jr."
Andy Dwyer,"Terminator said, ""I'll be back,"" and he was."
Tom Haverford,Also making a comeback the casual Hawaiian shirt.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, well, well, look, who's ahead of the curve."
Tom Haverford,I was joking.
Tom Haverford,You should soak that in bleach and burn it.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so, the rally's going to be held tomorrow at the Pawnee Sports Building."
Ann Perkins,"April, you finalized a rental, right?"
April Ludgate,"Shut up, Ann."
April Ludgate,I told you never to talk to me.
April Ludgate,That was Champion.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,Bad dog!
April Ludgate,"Yes, everything's fine with the rental."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you're constructing the stage?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,Leslie wanted to hire a contractor to build a stage.
Ron Swanson,"I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief."
Ben Wyatt,"Seal the edges by crimping the fork aw, crap."
Chris Traeger,Ben
Ben Wyatt,"What's up, Chris?"
Ben Wyatt,"Come on in, man."
Chris Traeger,I already did.
Chris Traeger,"So, uh, how you been?"
Chris Traeger,How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,How are you?
Ben Wyatt,"Great, actually."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just learning how to make a ""calizoinza."""
Ben Wyatt,"Or, as you Americans like to say, calzones."
Ben Wyatt,Do you want one?
Chris Traeger,"No, I find calzone fatty, and unnecessary."
Chris Traeger,"So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch, and I care about you, so I just want to make sure you're doing okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, honestly, I'm great."
Ben Wyatt,I'm just exploring whatever fun activity pops into my brain.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, check this out."
Ben Wyatt,I'm teaching myself how to do Claymation videos.
Ben Wyatt,Isn't this just so cool?
Chris Traeger,It is so cool!
Chris Traeger,"Ben is massively depressed, and he needs my help."
Leslie Knope,You look like a real campaign manager.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks, that's because I googled ""campaign manager"" and noticed that they wear a lot of dark colors."
Leslie Knope,"See, there's more things to look at on the Internet  besides naked guys, Ann."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"I need a team update, campaign manager."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Pistol Pete Disellio will be here in five minutes.
Leslie Knope,I still can't believe that you got him.
Leslie Knope,Ann got local hero Pistol Pete Disellio to endorse me at the rally.
Leslie Knope,"In 1992, Pistol Pete's last second dunk against Eagleton High clinched a comeback victory for the Pawnee Central drunken savages."
Leslie Knope,Team mascot later changed.
Tom Haverford,"Akash, buddy, of course I came to you first."
Tom Haverford,You're the best carpet man in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,But here's my question Do your carpets match your drapes?
Tom Haverford,How do you make any event classy on a budget?
Tom Haverford,Red carpet.
Tom Haverford,My entire apartment is red carpet.
Tom Haverford,"On top of that, leading into my bedroom, a second red carpet."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what's this in my shoe?"
Tom Haverford,Red carpet insole.
Tom Haverford,"Everywhere I go, I'm walking on red carpet."
Tom Haverford,Is there even enough room for everyone?
April Ludgate,"Here, sit on my lap."
Tom Haverford,"No, that's humiliating."
Tom Haverford,Can't I at least sit on Andy's lap?
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's Champion's spot."
Andy Dwyer,He called it.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, we're already late."
Ron Swanson,"Now, be a man, and sit on that girl's lap."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, sir."
Pete Disellio,"Hi, Pete Disellio."
Leslie Knope,"We can call you Pistol, right?"
Pete Disellio,I prefer Pete.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, got it."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,We overlapped a year at Pawnee Central.
Leslie Knope,You probably remember my voice from the morning announcements.
Leslie Knope,"This is my campaign manager, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,"Hi, nice to meet you."
Ann Perkins,Come on in.
Pete Disellio,"Oh, thanks."
Pete Disellio,I'm excited to be here.
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,We're excited to have you.
Leslie Knope,Ann is killing it.
Leslie Knope,My campaign team is unstoppable.
Leslie Knope,This rally is going to be awesome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!"
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna break dance!
Ann Perkins,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,Coming!
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Champion is a way better kisser than you are, babe."
April Ludgate,Nuhuh!
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, he is."
Andy Dwyer,He's even a better kisser than me.
Andy Dwyer,"Here, try some."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, stop it."
Tom Haverford,He's drooling on me!
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Ron Swanson,This is unsafe.
Andy Dwyer,Ha ha!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we should do it for the kids."
Andy Dwyer,"Kids love it, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Just for the kids.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, kids!"
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look."
Andy Dwyer,The police even love it.
Andy Dwyer,They're sirening back to us.
Andy Dwyer,"That's awesome, I was going to tell them that we Heard ya, bud!"
Leslie Knope,"And then, you come out, and you dunk the ball, and you say, ""Voting for Leslie Knope is a slam dunk!"""
Leslie Knope,"You can still dunk, right?"
Pete Disellio,"Oh, I can, but I won't."
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Pete Disellio,"Look, everywhere I go, everybody wants me to talk about that dunk, and that game."
Pete Disellio,It feels like I'm living in the past.
Leslie Knope,But the past is great.
Leslie Knope,"The jitterbug, stagecoaches, Herman Munster."
Pete Disellio,"Look, Leslie, I read up on you."
Pete Disellio,"You've done great stuff for our parks system and I will happily endorse you As Peter Disellio, regional distributor for Derwin ham loafs, but if this is about who I was, or what I did when I was 17, I'm out of here."
Leslie Knope,Let's not talk about dunking anymore.
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about what you want to do.
Pete Disellio,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think you want to dunk.
Pete Disellio,I'm not going to dunk the ball.
Ann Perkins,What about a layup?
Ron Swanson,"Officer, I've been operating heavy machinery since I was eight years old."
Ron Swanson,"Now, I respect you and your service to this town and your country, but what laws are we breaking exactly?"
Police Officer,"Well, you got four people in the front seat, nobody's wearing a seat belt, you were speeding and blasting your horn through the hospital zone, the rear of the vehicle's open, debris has been falling out, and you don't have a commercial license to drive a truck."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Well, we have a philosophical difference on what constitutes a law."
Police Officer,"I need to see your hands and could you step out of the vehicle, please?"
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to know we're about to be arrested.
Ann Perkins,"Oh my God, April, that's horrible."
Ann Perkins,Where are you?
Ann Perkins,"""My mother's butt,"" really?"
Ann Perkins,That's really helpful.
Leslie Knope,Let me talk to her.
Leslie Knope,"April, this is city council candidate Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,Do not make any trouble.
Leslie Knope,Sit tight.
Leslie Knope,I'm on my way.
Ann Perkins,Whoa.
Ann Perkins,You just hung up on her?
Leslie Knope,She'd already hung up on me.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me."
Leslie Knope,You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, but if I don't, it's no big deal, right?"
Ann Perkins,You'll just make your speech?
Leslie Knope,He's our surprise headliner.
Leslie Knope,The whole town loves him.
Leslie Knope,I'm polling at 1%.
Leslie Knope,"He must dunk, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Do whatever it takes.
Leslie Knope,"You know, anything short of sexual favors."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"I do not I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors."
Ann Perkins,I wasn't going to.
Leslie Knope,"Good, I wouldn't either."
Leslie Knope,That's where I draw the line.
Leslie Knope,"Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me."
Ann Perkins,Go.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Chris Traeger,"So, Ben"
Chris Traeger,Why Calzone?
Ben Wyatt,"Glad you asked, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, there's fast food hamburgers."
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Mexican.
Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Chinese.
Ben Wyatt,Blah blah blah.
Ben Wyatt,Have you ever wondered why there isn't a fast food option for Italian food?
Chris Traeger,What about pizza?
Ben Wyatt,Pizza?
Ben Wyatt,Never heard of it.
Ben Wyatt,"That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.
Chris Traeger,Never thought of it that way.
Ben Wyatt,"What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container."
Ben Wyatt,It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.
Chris Traeger,Amazing.
Ben Wyatt,And you of all people will like this.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna use low fat ingredients.
Chris Traeger,Gamechanger.
Ben Wyatt,"And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery ""The Lowcal Calzone Zone."""
Chris Traeger,That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.
Chris Traeger,That idea is terrible.
Leslie Knope,"Glen, you're killing me."
Police Officer,"They broke about 50 laws, Knope."
Police Officer,"And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice homecooked meal, and do what comes naturally."
Police Officer,That's not appropriate.
Leslie Knope,You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.
Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team."
Leslie Knope,"I need them, please."
Police Officer,Fine.
Police Officer,"But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck."
Ann Perkins,It would just mean so much to us.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're a living legend."
Ann Perkins,They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.
Pete Disellio,"Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a doubleedged sword."
Pete Disellio,"Everybody in this town still calls me ""Pistol."""
Ann Perkins,"Tell me more about that, Peter."
Pete Disellio,"I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?"
Chris Traeger,"Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, thanks, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.
Chris Traeger,"You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here."
Chris Traeger,I think getting some perspective would be good.
Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?
Chris Traeger,I've known you a long time.
Chris Traeger,"And, right now, you need help."
Ben Wyatt,With my Claymaish?
Chris Traeger,With your life.
Chris Traeger,"You are wildly, insanely depressed."
Ben Wyatt,Depressed?
Ben Wyatt,I'm the furthest thing from depressed.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look at what I've accomplished."
Ben Wyatt,Do you see him?
Ben Wyatt,Do you think a depressed person could make this?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ron Swanson,That's all we can fit in here.
Leslie Knope,No problem.
Leslie Knope,This is going to be fine.
Leslie Knope,"We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do."
April Ludgate,"Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,He shall do it in the car!
Leslie Knope,"Answer your phone, Ann."
Pete Disellio,That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.
Pete Disellio,"Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline."
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around."
Ben Wyatt,I'm not faffing around.
Ben Wyatt,I've sunk myself into my hobbies.
Ben Wyatt,"Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, and I think it's really good."
Ben Wyatt,"So just hang on to your hat, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Here it goes.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, how great."
Chris Traeger,Did you pause it?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I hang on."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,That's the whole thing.
Ben Wyatt,That's three weeks of work.
Chris Traeger,You're gonna be okay.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,"You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool."
Ben Wyatt,"I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer?"
Chris Traeger,"Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame."
Chris Traeger,But we are going to get through this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, no word from Ann."
Leslie Knope,"April, I need a status report."
Leslie Knope,How's it looking out there?
April Ludgate,"Perfect, but just one thing."
April Ludgate,It's not a basketball court any more.
April Ludgate,It's an ice skating rink.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What happened?
April Ludgate,The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.
April Ludgate,"Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how's the stage coming?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?"
Andy Dwyer,"We had to ""Jetsons"" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house."
Tom Haverford,Wow.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I got Pistol Pete."
Leslie Knope,"Good, where is he?"
Ann Perkins,"Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work."
Ann Perkins,"I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, the important news is that he's here."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Is he going to dunk for me?
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying."
Leslie Knope,He's crying?
Ann Perkins,"No, I was crying."
Ann Perkins,"It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"We should cancel it, right?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we should cancel it?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.
Leslie Knope,"Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, first of all, I don't like it when you guys use that term."
Jerry Gergich," But for the record, I came through."
Jerry Gergich, There are almost a hundred people out there! 
Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry?"
Leslie Knope,"I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem."
Leslie Knope," Okay, guys, everybody listen up."
Leslie Knope, I just wanted to say thank you.
Leslie Knope," You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it."
Leslie Knope," Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can."
Leslie Knope," You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar."
Tom Haverford, That would be Hurley's.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's karaoke tonight! "
April Ludgate,Yes!
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, guys."
Ann Perkins, No.
Ann Perkins," We're not leaving, okay? We're the reason Leslie's in this mess."
Ann Perkins, It's our mess.
Ann Perkins, We're going to stay here and we're going to go out there as a team.
Tom Haverford," Or, we go as a team to Hurley's."
Ron Swanson," No, Ann's right."
Ron Swanson, We're a team.
Ron Swanson, We're all going out together.
Leslie Knope, Let's give this crowd a show.
Ron Swanson," Go, team! "
Leslie Knope, Tom?
Tom Haverford,Couldn't afford enough premium carpet to get us to the stage.
Tom Haverford," I mean, it was a short walk, but it was pretty luxurious, right?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope, Everybody smile and wave.
Music,  Get up and make it happen   get on your feet 
April Ludgate,"Stop leaning on my arm, Andy."
Ron Swanson, I'm holding the dog.
Ron Swanson, He is peeing.
Ron Swanson, He is now peeing.
Ron Swanson, I am putting him down.
April Ludgate," No, Ron, he only has three legs!"
Ann Perkins,Get off me!
Tom Haverford,"No, I'm scared!"
Music, Get up and make it happen 
Leslie Knope,Ron? Ron? There's no stairs.
Leslie Knope, How do I get onto the stage? Okay.
Leslie Knope, Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!  Mm-mm.
Chris Traeger, Here you go.
Chris Traeger," Drink up, because it has every herb in my herb belt."
Ben Wyatt, Oh.
Ben Wyatt, Tastes like a belt.
Chris Traeger," I know, isn't it awful? But it works wonderfully."
Chris Traeger," So, tell me."
Chris Traeger, Do you admit that you're depressed? 
Ben Wyatt,How did you know? I didn't even know.
Chris Traeger," The Letters to Cleo t-shirt, the unshaven face, the Doc Martins, and your hair does not have that normal, uptight, rigid, inflexible Ben Wyatt sense of fun."
Chris Traeger, You can't hide these things from friends.
Ben Wyatt, I think I'm feeling better.
Chris Traeger," Herbal smoothie, you have done it again."
Leslie Knope," As a loyal pawneean, I've always been proud of this town, and, I, oh, um, sorry."
Leslie Knope, My cards got out of order here when they fell.
Leslie Knope," Together, we can defeat obese children."
Leslie Knope," I'm sure that was something positive, originally."
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry, okay, this is just a disaster, isn't it? This is the worst political event ever in history."
Leslie Knope," Well, um, I can assure you people in the bleachers that, if you follow my campaign, it will be interesting."
Pete Disellio," It sure will be! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete, and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend! I just wanted to say that I fully endorse Leslie Knope."
Pete Disellio," She's got a great team behind her, and a vote for her is a slam dunk."
Leslie Knope," Thanks, Pistol Pete!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, we're so happy to have you."
Leslie Knope," Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope, There he goes.
Leslie Knope," Come on, Pete! Oh!"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, stay still."
Ann Perkins, Stay down.
Leslie Knope," Pistol Pete, everybody."
Leslie Knope, Still got it.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how was the rally?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we nailed it!"
Leslie Knope,"No, we didn't."
Leslie Knope," Ben, my campaign manager and I have made a decision."
Ann Perkins," We've decided to fire the campaign manager, me."
Leslie Knope,And hire you.
Ben Wyatt,But we've talked about this.
Leslie Knope, I don't care if you're poison to my campaign.
Leslie Knope, This team has a lot of heart and zero know-how.
Leslie Knope, You're the only one that can save us.
Leslie Knope, Please be my campaign manager.
Chris Traeger," You know, Leslie, Ben's really been going through something, and he's on a journey, so I don't think he's gonna be"
Ben Wyatt,I'll do it.
Ben Wyatt, I'm in.
Ben Wyatt, I've done enough exploring.
Ben Wyatt, I'm good.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're fired."
Ann Perkins," Oh, thank God."
April Ludgate," No, don't make out."
April Ludgate, It's making Champion sad.
Ann Perkins, Surprise! We felt really bad about the whole dredging up your past just to be publically humiliated thing.
Leslie Knope,"So, cookies."
Ann Perkins,And balloons.
Pete Disellio," Thanks, guys."
Pete Disellio," It, that's nice."
Ann Perkins, We feel so bad.
Ann Perkins, Is there anything else we can do?
Pete Disellio,You could let me take you to dinner.
Leslie Knope," Yes, Ann, yes."
Leslie Knope, You should do that.
Ann Perkins," Oh, I can't, though, because I'm married."
Leslie Knope, You're not married.
Leslie Knope, She's not married.
Ann Perkins, This is uncomfortable.

Extra,"Ladies and gentlemen, the next city councilor for the great city of Pawnee Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,Hey.
Bobby Newport,"Thanks, guy."
Bobby Newport,"Hey, all right."
Bobby Newport,"Hi, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,"You know, we're two days into this campaign, and so far it's going great."
Bobby Newport,"In fact, I don't know why they call it a ""campain."""
Bobby Newport,"Because up until now it's been a ""campleasure."""
Bobby Newport,"All right, hey, why don't we line up for autographs and free Bobby bars."
Bobby Newport,Huh?
Bobby Newport,Who wants a Bobby bar?
Leslie Knope,"Bobby Newport, heir to the sweetums candy fortune."
Bobby Newport,My dad made 'em.
Leslie Knope,"He just entered the race, and he's already 70 points up in all the polls."
Leslie Knope,He is attractive and charming.
Leslie Knope,"And his family employs half the town, but so what?"
Leslie Knope,I am a lifelong government bureaucrat who's wellversed in the issues.
Leslie Knope,And those are the kind of sexy qualifications that win elections.
Bobby Newport,How's it going?
Bobby Newport,I'm Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport,But you probably knew that already.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Mr."
Leslie Knope,"Newport, we meet at last."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Bobby Newport,"Ah, okeydoke."
Bobby Newport,So do you want me to sign that to miss lope or just Nesney?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Leslie's fine.
Bobby Newport,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, miss Knope is a candidate for city council."
Ben Wyatt,Been calling your office trying to set up a debate.
Bobby Newport,"Oh, no, you guys are wrong."
Bobby Newport,I'm running unopposed.
Bobby Newport,"I'm pretty sure I'm running unopposed, right?"
Leslie Knope,"No, you're not running unopposed."
Leslie Knope,You've very opposed by me.
Bobby Newport,"Oh, terrific."
Bobby Newport,I love meeting people.
Bobby Newport,"I love it, yeah."
Bobby Newport,What do you guys do?
Leslie Knope,We just told you.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna be running for city council.
Bobby Newport,Great.
Bobby Newport,"Here, have a Bobby bar."
Bobby Newport,"Go ahead, my dad made 'em."
Extra,"Okay, folks."
Bobby Newport,"Hey, I'm Bobby Newport."
Leslie Knope,I think we scared him.
Bobby Newport,"Here, have a Bobby bar."
Bobby Newport,My dad made 'em.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse or did they fire you because you slept with all the doctors?"
Ann Perkins,You wanna try that again?
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, are you still a nurse?"
April Ludgate,Because Andy's not feeling well.
Ann Perkins,"What's wrong, Andy?"
Andy Dwyer,Just got a headache.
Andy Dwyer,And I'm seeing double.
Andy Dwyer,"And I got a song stuck in my head, and my teeth hurt."
Andy Dwyer,Also I'm hungry.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, some of those things are symptoms and some of them are just being a person."
Ann Perkins,Did you hit your head?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yes, technically I did smash my head area into the wall area."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he was hanging up his gold record."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I'm good."
Andy Dwyer,"Point is, I have a gold record."
Ann Perkins,"Well, I can help you with cuts and bruises but the other stuff you're gonna have to see a real doctor."
April Ludgate,"Hey, smart ass, we can't afford it."
Ann Perkins,"Hey, smart ass, yes, you can."
Ann Perkins,You have insurance.
Andy Dwyer,Neither of your asses are that smart because insurance is for if something bad happens to your car.
Andy Dwyer,P.S. I haven't had it in years.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, we used to live together."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you still got it for me."
Bobby Newport,I'm Bobby Newport.
Bobby Newport,My family owns nine square Miles of land in this town.
Bobby Newport,And isn't my family what this town's really about?
Bobby Newport,Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Ann Perkins,That guy is everywhere.
Donna Meagle,I am not complaining.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we have to find a way to beat him."
Leslie Knope,And luckily Ben is going to announce the most amazing campaign strategy ever thought of in the entire history of western democracy.
Leslie Knope,"Go, Ben, here's your great idea."
Leslie Knope,We're all ready for it.
Leslie Knope,And start.
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office.
Leslie Knope,I'm surrounded by my friends.
Leslie Knope,My campaign manager and I are in love.
Leslie Knope,This is exactly how I dreamed it would be when I was a kid.
Leslie Knope,Except I wasn't and my campaign manager was Mr. Belvedere
Ben Wyatt,We are David.
Ben Wyatt,Newport is goliath.
Ben Wyatt,This is our slingshot.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we'll write an inspiring oped piece."
Ben Wyatt,"No, the Pawnee Eagleton high school basketball game."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, in this town it's bigger than the super bowl."
Ben Wyatt,"We take all our money, we air a TV ad right at halftime."
Ben Wyatt,And I think we should make an attack ad against Bobby Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Ann Perkins,That is a great idea!
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,"Yay, it's a good idea."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, great."
Ben Wyatt,So let's get to work.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,How are you?
Ron Swanson,Present.
Chris Traeger,"I have a meeting at public works, and I was thinking that maybe you might wanna sit in."
Ron Swanson,Why would you think that?
Chris Traeger,"They are working on a number of fascinating, big budget projects"
Ron Swanson,I'm very busy here.
Chris Traeger,That I am being forced to brutally cut entirely.
Ron Swanson,I can make room in my schedule.
Chris Traeger,Wonderful.
Chris Traeger,"As you know, I'm not a big fan of delivering bad news."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, it would be my absolute pleasure."
Ron Swanson,Have you considered cutting the entire fire department?
Ron Swanson,I've personally put out several local fires at no cost to the taxpayer.
Dr. Harris,Look to the left.
Dr. Harris,The right.
Dr. Harris,Whatever.
April Ludgate,Are you the kind of doctor who gets hooked on his own drugs?
April Ludgate,I bet you are.
Dr. Harris,"So, Andy, tell me what happened."
Andy Dwyer,"I was reading an encyclopedia, and I tripped or ""fell over"" and hit my head or brain helmet."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he sneezed and smacked his head against the wall."
Dr. Harris,That sounds about right.
Dr. Harris,"Well, if it's a concussion it's extremely mild, so I wouldn't worry about it."
Dr. Harris,Anything else bothering you?
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Dr. Harris,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I mean, yeah, I've got a weird rash in my knee pit area."
Andy Dwyer,"And my tongue, on this side, doesn't taste anything anymore."
Andy Dwyer,"Sometimes when I walk my ankles make, like, a weird rattlesnake sound."
Dr. Harris,What else?
Andy Dwyer,Things that are far away from my eyes are fuzzy.
Andy Dwyer,"I once at a twix with the wrapper on it, and I've never seen the wrapper come out."
Andy Dwyer,Also I've swallowed every piece of gum that I've chewed for the past 25 years.
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,I broke my thumb on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer,Just fix me.
Dr. Harris,"Well, I can help you with the thumb."
Dr. Harris,And I'll have to give you referrals for specialists for the other thousand things.
April Ludgate,"Wow, thanks for nothing, Dr. Harris"
Dr. Harris,You're welcome.
Bobby Newport,"Hey, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,I'm a regular guy.
Bobby Newport,I like dogs.
Bobby Newport,"I'm here with my persian greyhound raclette, who was given to me by my buddy, the pretender to the crown of Alsace-Lorraine."
Bobby Newport,Vote Bobby Newport for city council.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, um, between you and me, I think that Donna is having a problem with going negative in the ad."
Donna Meagle,"Nahuh, I always go negative."
Donna Meagle,Even if I like the guy I go negative.
Donna Meagle,Keeps 'em interested.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Donna."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I didn't want to tell you this, but Ann is having a hard time with it."
Leslie Knope,She's kind of freaking out right now.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, this magic marker smells like cherries."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, here's a question, do you like the idea?"
Leslie Knope,It's who
Leslie Knope,Do you like it?
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you have a vision of how your campaign should go."
Ben Wyatt,"I am your chief strategist, so I'm sure we can work it out."
Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just tell me what you're thinking.
Leslie Knope,"I hate negative ads, and I would never do one in a million years."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, John, for coming in."
Chris Traeger,"The public works department is wonderful, and you are the best idea man in the business."
Ron Swanson,Also we're cancelling all of your ongoing projects.
Extra,What?
Extra,What about the Pawnee river dam?
Ron Swanson,Dam's dead.
Ron Swanson,Have a nice day.
Extra,Where will all the water go?
Ron Swanson,Wherever it's headed now.
Ron Swanson,The important thing is the dam is never happening and your dream has been crushed.
Chris Traeger,We're very sorry.
Ron Swanson,I am not.
Ron Swanson,Good meeting.
Ben Wyatt,It's not a negative ad.
Ben Wyatt,"We're stating facts about him, and, yeah, they happen to be negative because he's a bonehead."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wanted to run an ad that highlights the good things about me, not the bad things about somebody else."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are our communications director."
Leslie Knope,Weigh in here.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I love your idea."
Tom Haverford,I also love your idea.
Tom Haverford,"Two great ideas, two great people."
Tom Haverford,"I don't know which idea's better, but I do know I'll end up on the winning side."
Tom Haverford,"When I bet on horses, I never lose."
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,I bet on all the horses.
Ben Wyatt,"How about we do this, we split up into teams, we each make a demo version of our ad."
Ben Wyatt,Whichever one we like better we use.
Tom Haverford,Great idea!
Tom Haverford,As long as Leslie thinks so as well.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'll pick Ann and Donna for my team."
Leslie Knope,You can take Jerry.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you wanted to go negative."
Leslie Knope,"You got the biggest negative in the world, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Okay everybody I need big smiles from you We're making a positive ad here.
Leslie Knope,So just think of this as Christmas and your birthday and the first day of school all rolled up into one.
Leslie Knope,Positive is always better than negative.
Leslie Knope,"Barack Obama said, ""yes we can,"" and now he's president."
Leslie Knope,"Ben says, ""no we shouldn't,"" and now he's working for his girlfriend."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, I need double the smiles, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's take it back again.
Leslie Knope,And action.
Leslie Knope,And this is going great.
Leslie Knope,We're really positive.
Leslie Knope,"I think we're getting good stuff, right?"
Leslie Knope,What's it?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, I think Bobby Newport's bus was in that shot."
Leslie Knope,Do you think?
Andy Dwyer,"E, h, 4, m."
Andy Dwyer,Potato shape.
Andy Dwyer,Coffee mug shape.
Andy Dwyer,"Smudge, smudge, middle finger, smudge."
Andy Dwyer,The rest are all smudges.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, you drove us here."
Andy Dwyer,"We made, like, 100 million doctors' appointments for ourselves in one week."
April Ludgate,"After this we won't have to go to the doctor for, like, ten years, because we're smart."
Extra,"Well, you definitely need glasses."
April Ludgate,"No, he's not getting glasses."
April Ludgate,I like his face the way it is.
April Ludgate,"If you get glasses, I'll divorce you."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you heard her, doc."
Andy Dwyer,"Too handsome for glasses, no offense."
Tom Haverford,"I gotta admit, his hair game's on point."
Tom Haverford,Gotta find out what kind of product he puts up in his hair.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how's Leslie's ad going?"
Tom Haverford,It's very good.
Tom Haverford,But yours is also very good.
Jerry Gergich,You ready for the voiceover?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Tom Haverford,You gotta give it more attitude.
Tom Haverford,It's gotta scare people.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, okay."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport's never had a real job in his life.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby Newport.
Tom Haverford,Bobby Newport.
Jerry Gergich,Bobby.
Tom Haverford,Bobby.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby.
Jerry Gergich,Newport.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, now we're just wasting time, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,I want to thank you for being so ruthless and cruel in the meeting the other day.
Ron Swanson,You'll have to be more specific.
Chris Traeger,With the public works department about the dam.
Ron Swanson,Ah.
Chris Traeger,What do you say I take you to lunch and then we can talk about all the projects that you want to get accomplished.
Ron Swanson,That won't be necessary.
Ron Swanson,I don't have any projects.
Ron Swanson,I hate projects.
Chris Traeger,What a pill.
Chris Traeger,We should order.
Chris Traeger,And then we can talk shop.
Chris Traeger,What are you gonna have?
Chris Traeger,I'm thinking something raw and cucumber based.
Chris Traeger,A cucumber.
Ron Swanson,I don't know what happened.
Ron Swanson,I declined his invitation.
Ron Swanson,He started laughing.
Ron Swanson,"And the next thing I knew, we were at lunch."
Ron Swanson,Did he drug me?
Bobby Newport,"Hi, I'm Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,My dad is friends with John cougar mellencamp.
Bobby Newport,That's pretty cool.
Leslie Knope,"What is this guy running for, president of being on every channel all the time?"
Ann Perkins,"Reminder, Leslie, we have less than an hour to get the ad to the station."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're beautiful and you're organized."
Leslie Knope,"So in order not to bias anyone, these are the two ads that Ben and I made."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna pick one randomly, and we'll play that one first."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yay, the awesome one."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"I'm pro parks, pro public safety, and I'm pro clean water."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also pro environmental regulation, and I'm very, very pro local propositions 45, 86, and 102F. But most of all, I'm pro Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Here are some other things that I'm pro.
Leslie Knope,"As you can see, I'm in favor of a lot of things, like hot dogs."
Leslie Knope,"Right, Charlie?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm Leslie Knope, and I approve this message."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Tom Haverford,Fantastic.
Leslie Knope,Do we even want to screen yours?
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, yeah, that was awful."
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Leslie Knope,Name one thing that was wrong with it.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you never even mentioned you were running for office."
Ben Wyatt,"You literally never said the words ""city council."""
Leslie Knope,I did it's implied.
Leslie Knope,I didn't we can just put it in.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie is so good at so many things and so bad at that.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport's been handed everything on a silver platter.
Ben Wyatt,"His cushy job at his dad's candy company, handed to him."
Ben Wyatt,"His 60 foot boat, Bobby's boat, handed to him when he was 12."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten."
Ann Perkins,She has.
Ben Wyatt,Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.
Ben Wyatt,Don't.
Ann Perkins,I won't.
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, yes."
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, people, this is an ad."
Ben Wyatt,"It's succinct, it's punchy."
Leslie Knope,It's mean.
Leslie Knope,It's depressing.
Leslie Knope,It's awful.
Leslie Knope,"""I am Ben Wyatt, and I want to destroy Leslie's dreams."""
Extra,"Okay, if you're allergic to any food, we'll know in a few days."
Andy Dwyer,I think based on the redness I might be allergic to getting stabbed by needles.
Andy Dwyer,"We have already been to, like, five different doctors."
Andy Dwyer,I got my ankles microwaved.
April Ludgate,Xrayed.
Andy Dwyer,They took my blood away to use for science.
April Ludgate,Cholesterol tests.
Andy Dwyer,April had her sinuses removed?
April Ludgate,Looked at.
Andy Dwyer,"Some guy looked at my wiener, touched it."
Andy Dwyer,That was weird.
April Ludgate,And that guy wasn't even a doctor.
Andy Dwyer,That What?
Leslie Knope,Now I think it is time for us to take a vote.
Leslie Knope,So who's in favor of Ben's ad?
Leslie Knope,Traitors!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, I painted your garage pink."
Ann Perkins,I did not ask you to do that.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, look, I want you to win, and Ben's ad is just better."
Leslie Knope,Our friendship is over.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Leslie Knope,It's not over.
Leslie Knope,It's never over.
Leslie Knope,Bff.
Leslie Knope,I love you forever.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, it seems like we're kind of evenly split."
Leslie Knope,I think we should keep debating.
Ben Wyatt,We're not split.
Ben Wyatt,It's unanimous.
Ben Wyatt,We air my ad.
Leslie Knope,But I This is just it's just not the way I dreamed it would be.
Ben Wyatt,"This is the right call, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to air a negative ad.
Leslie Knope,It's out of my hands now.
Leslie Knope,"But you know what, I'm actually feeling very zen about this."
Extra,Are you are Ben Wyatt?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Extra,"Okay, I need that DVD in the control room."
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,"I am Leslie Knope, and I do not approve this message."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Ben Wyatt,"Give it to me, no"
Ben Wyatt,What are you Ah.
Tom Haverford,"Alright, the good news is, there's only two pieces of bad news."
Tom Haverford,"The bad news is, none of our ads aired and we cannot get our money back."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,There was probably a better way for you to tell us that.
Tom Haverford,You both really blew this.
Tom Haverford,But I can't wait to hear your new ideas.
Tom Haverford,I love them already.
Tom Haverford,"Ooh, I'm hungry."
Tom Haverford,Tommy needs a mango.
Tom Haverford,See ya.
Leslie Knope,I'm really sorry I tackled you.
Leslie Knope,"It's just, I'd rather run the fake campaign ads that I made when I was ten than become negative and cynical."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I really don't wanna crush your childhood dreams, but I bet in your dreams you weren't losing an election by 70 points."
Ben Wyatt,"You need to get tougher, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,You just have to.
Leslie Knope,You need to get tougher.
Leslie Knope,You were pretty easy to take down.
Jerry Gergich,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,Just the man I wanted to see.
Chris Traeger,"I'm going to be going to a seminar on the art of the japanese tea ceremony Or chakai the Pawnee community college, and I thought you might like to come with me."
Ron Swanson,Why?
Chris Traeger,I know how much you value silence.
Ron Swanson,A fair point.
Ron Swanson,"But we did just have lunch last week, so I feel like we've spent enough social time together for the foreseeable Ever."
Chris Traeger,"All right, well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me."
Chris Traeger,Donna Meagle!
Donna Meagle,Chris Traeger!
Ron Swanson,For some godforsaken reason that man is suddenly determined to hang on with me.
Donna Meagle,You mean hang out?
Ron Swanson,What is wrong with him?
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, he's got you doing Ben's job, eating lunch with him like Ben used to."
Donna Meagle,Maybe he just misses his little buddy.
April Ludgate,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Let's get you home and get me some ice cream.
Extra,Here's your bill.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, yeah, won't be needing that."
Andy Dwyer,I've got the free medicine card.
Extra,"Uh, there's a $500 deductible for dental procedures."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I think you're wrong."
Andy Dwyer,We have the insurance thing.
Andy Dwyer,I believe we're covered.
Extra,It's still $500.
Andy Dwyer,Let's see here.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, because, you know what Let's go!"

Andy Dwyer,Out of the way!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Whoohoohoo!
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, call an ambulance!"
Andy Dwyer,A different ambulance than the one I ran into.
Ben Wyatt,This is city council candidate Leslie Knope when she was ten years old.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,I love Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And I want to make it even better.
Leslie Knope,"Better schools, safer streets, and a more progressive tax on residential properties."
Ben Wyatt,This is city council candidate Bobby Newport today.
Bobby Newport,"People keep asking me: Bobby, what are you gonna do once you get into office?"
Bobby Newport,"Um, I'm pretty sure I'll figure it out."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Knope had better ideas when she was ten than Bobby Newport has now.
Ben Wyatt,They do have one thing in common.
Bobby Newport,I like dogs.
Leslie Knope,I like dogs.
Ben Wyatt,"For a better Pawnee, vote Knope for city council."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we already have a thousand views."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but no calls from reporters, no interview requests."
Leslie Knope,I don't care.
Leslie Knope,I'm proud of it.
Ben Wyatt,You sure?
Leslie Knope,"It is accurate about my opponent, it does not take"
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold that thought."
Chris Traeger,Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,What a pleasant surprise.
Chris Traeger,And who's this?
Ron Swanson,This is a great friend of mine.
Ron Swanson,He is a fellow who works in the building and he is named Dennis.
Kyle,Kyle.
Ron Swanson,"He strongly enjoys japanese culture, and I thought he might wanna go with you to the thing."
Chris Traeger,The tea ceremony.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Chris Traeger,You're a brother japanophile?
Kyle,"I was eating rice, and Ron made me come up here."
Kyle,"But sure, that sounds fun."

Chris Traeger,"Ron, a moment."
Chris Traeger,"All right, pal, level with me."

Chris Traeger,I'm not lonely.
Chris Traeger, I have me.
Chris Traeger," And 4,000 Facebook friends and a hot girlfriend."
Chris Traeger," I wanted to spend time with you, because I have to replace Ben as assistant city manager and I was giving you a tryout of sorts."
Chris Traeger," Now, I'll mull my options for the next few months, but I'd love you to keep an open mind."
Chris Traeger, Kyle-San! Arigato!

Bobby Newport," You guys want anything? This is a restaurant, so they have food and stuff."
Leslie Knope, I'll take a milkshake.
Ben Wyatt,We're good.
Leslie Knope," No, we're good."
Leslie Knope, What can we do for you?
Bobby Newport,"Yes, um, why'd you guys post that video of me, man? I mean, that didn't make me feel good."
Bobby Newport, It was it was mean.
Bobby Newport, You guys are mean.
Leslie Knope," Well, we used your own ad, so I don't think it was mean."
Bobby Newport," All right, let me lay it out for you."
Bobby Newport, My friends keep sending me links to that video and they just make fun of me.
Bobby Newport," So just stop running, okay? Just that stop."
Leslie Knope, Stop running the ad?
Bobby Newport,"No, stop running the campaign."
Leslie Knope, What?
Bobby Newport,Just quit.
Bobby Newport, It would be so cool of you if you just quit.
Bobby Newport," Then I can win the election, and I'll have a big party, and I'll put you both on the guest list, plus one."
Bobby Newport, I'm gonna have a man who does magic.
Bobby Newport, He's really good.
Bobby Newport," Not, like, cheesy magic."
Bobby Newport," Like, good magic."
Leslie Knope, We're not gonna quit the campaign.
Leslie Knope, Why would we do that?
Bobby Newport,Because I want it.
Bobby Newport," Come on, give me it."
Bobby Newport, Give me it.
Bobby Newport, Give me it.
Bobby Newport," Come on, give me it."
Bobby Newport, Just give me the election.
Bobby Newport," I'm sorry, please."
Bobby Newport, Please.
Ben Wyatt," Well, Leslie, he does make a compelling argument."
Bobby Newport," Come on, ugh! Come on, guy."
Leslie Knope,Bobby.
Bobby Newport," - Ah, it's not padded!"
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question? Why are you even running for office?
Bobby Newport," You know what, I need something to do to get my dad off my back."
Bobby Newport, This seemed easy.
Bobby Newport," What about you, why are you doing it? Who's your dad?"
Leslie Knope,I'm running for office because I want to improve the lives of the people that I love and the city that's the greatest city in the world.
Bobby Newport," What? What does that even mean? Hey, I've got an idea."
Bobby Newport," How 'bout you quit running, then I win, but then I let you do all the work."
Leslie Knope," I'm not going anywhere, and we are gonna debate soon, and I need to warn you, I know my stuff."
Leslie Knope, So you should toughen up.
Bobby Newport, Why are you guys smiling? I feel bad.
Bobby Newport," Hey, quick question."
Bobby Newport, That little girl from your video.
Bobby Newport," Oh, my God, she's so cute."
Bobby Newport, Do you think you can talk to her and let her do an ad for me?
Leslie Knope,That girl is me as a ten-year-old.
Bobby Newport, How'd you do that?
April Ludgate,Maybe you should see one of the other doctors.
Andy Dwyer, No.
Andy Dwyer, No more doctors.
Andy Dwyer, They're a bunch of scam artists.
Andy Dwyer, They reel you in with the free stuff.
Andy Dwyer," Next thing you know, bam, you run into an ambulance."
Andy Dwyer, Every time.
Andy Dwyer, Let's just go home and care for each other.
Andy Dwyer, We could buy a sewing kit.
Andy Dwyer, You could sew up my lip underneath a bridge somewhere.
April Ludgate," Mmm, so romantic."
April Ludgate,"Oh, sorry, I forgot."
April Ludgate, Let's go.
Andy Dwyer, All right.
Andy Dwyer," Do you think sewing kits are covered by insurance? Or groceries or, like, Xbox games? What is insurance?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate, Who cares?

,Season: 4 Episode: 13
Leslie Knope,I will institute a reduction in taxes For the small business owner as well as a 7% surcharge on all nonlocal business related development.
Leslie Knope,Together we will build a better pawnee.
Tom Haverford,So what we're looking for here are your overall impressions of this candidate.
Tom Haverford,What do you like about her?
Tom Haverford,What don't you like about her?
Tom Haverford,"Her ideas, her voice, her clothes probably."
Leslie Knope,"Well, my campaign has a little momentum, so we're trying to capitalize on that by doing a focus group."
Leslie Knope,Some things are very helpful.
Leslie Knope,Other things are not so helpful.
Leslie Knope,All the things make me feel a lot of feelings about myself.
Extra,"She's kinda short, don't you think?"
Extra,Aggressively short almost.
Extra,It's like she's throwing it in my face.
Tom Haverford,Insightful.
Donna Meagle,"You, sir, said you would not vote for her, correct?"
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,"Yeah, she seems a little uptight."
Derek,"She doesn't seem like the kind of person you could go bowling with, you know?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,I am excellent at bowling.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I know it's tough to hear these things, but just try not to get obsessed over one comment."
Leslie Knope,You're totally right.
Leslie Knope,I'm not obsessing.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just reminding myself to tell Ron to tell you how good I am at bowling.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Extra,"I actually thought that she was smart, and I'd vote for her."
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Extra,"Although I once knew a Leslie, and, uh, she was just awful."
Extra,So now I hate all Leslies.
Extra,Would she consider changing her name?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here we go."
Ben Wyatt,71% said you have a strong command of the issues.
Ben Wyatt,"That is good, but only 33% said that they would consider voting for you."
Leslie Knope,"Mm, yeah, that's really interesting stuff."
Leslie Knope,Why did that guy say that he wouldn't want to go bowling with me?
Ben Wyatt,You really have to let that go.
Leslie Knope,I've never been very good at letting things go.
Leslie Knope,I can't tell you how many times a fun tugofwar with a dog over a chew toy turned contentious.
Leslie Knope,One of us always ends up mad.
Leslie Knope,"I did some research too about the guy who said the thing about me and bowling, and his name is Derek."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,And get this he's not even that good of a bowler.
Leslie Knope,"His average is 132, according to the most recent available data."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, that comment wasn't really about whether you're good at bowling "
Leslie Knope,which I am.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Ben Wyatt,Which we all know you are.
Ben Wyatt,But some people have the impression that you're a little elitist or intellectual or something.
Leslie Knope,That is so sexist.
Leslie Knope,It's just because I'm a woman.
Leslie Knope,"Would they deign to say such things to Woodrow Wilson or Benjamin Disraeli okay, I see what you're talking about."
Ben Wyatt,"See, a lot of people don't vote with their brains."
Ben Wyatt,They vote with their guts.
Ben Wyatt,"I know you're fun, and you can have a good time."
Ben Wyatt,The public needs to see that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then maybe the campaign should host a bowling night."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,It would be laidback.
Leslie Knope,"Everyone having fun, great photo op."
Ben Wyatt,That could actually work.
Leslie Knope,Also I'm really good at bowling.
Ben Wyatt,"No, I don't think I believe you."
Ben Wyatt,Is there anyone I can ask?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding.
Jerry Gergich,"All right, it is time for the 12th Leslie Knope Fundraising Phone Bank."
Jerry Gergich,Is everybody feeling good?
April Ludgate,"Oh, I don't know, Jerry."
April Ludgate,"It's Sunday night, I'm making phone calls to strangers, and you're in my house."
April Ludgate,My life couldn't be worse.
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Chris Traeger,Let's get this phone party started.
April Ludgate,No.
Chris Traeger,"Sorry I'm late, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"I know this kind of thing can be a grind, but Ben said that this is the most important thing we can do to help Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,So tonight is going to be fun.
Jerry Gergich,"You're probably thinking, how could it possibly be fun?"
Chris Traeger,No one's thinking that.
Andy Dwyer,I kinda was.
Chris Traeger,I was not.
Andy Dwyer,Why are we laughing?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, anyway, tonight we are gonna spice things up with a little competition."
Jerry Gergich,Whoever raises the most money by the end of the night will win two free movie passes to the pawnee monoplex.
April Ludgate,You really think that's gonna motivate people
Chris Traeger,"oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,I could use that for a romantic night with Millicent Gergich.
Chris Traeger,"Out of my way, suckers."
Chris Traeger,"As city manager, I play no favorites."
Chris Traeger,"But as a private citizen, I am free to support whomever I choose, and I choose to support team Knope because they're the best."
Chris Traeger,Everybody's the best.
Chris Traeger,We're all winners.
Leslie Knope,Do I look laidback?
Ann Perkins,You look like you're trying to look laidback.
Leslie Knope,How about now?
Ann Perkins,I think just maybe just stand how you would normally stand.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I forget now.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks for coming, man."
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,This bowling alley has my favorite restaurant in pawnee.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,You're not scared to eat here?
Ron Swanson,"When I eat, it is the food that is scared."
Ron Swanson,Why are you sitting weird?
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Tom Haverford,Who's ready to bowl so hard?
Tom Haverford,Tommy's new bowling swag.
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"When you do it, you really do it."
Ann Perkins,"Good for you, man."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Leslie Knope, who is running for city council."
Chris Traeger,Is this Deirdre Splatterfork?
Chris Traeger,That is literally the most beautiful name I have ever heard.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I don't think we can accept donations over 50 dollars."
Jerry Gergich,"I don't really know why you would need my social security number, but well, yeah, no."
Jerry Gergich,You're right.
Jerry Gergich,I guess it couldn't hurt to give it to you.
Jerry Gergich,It's 2 1 0
Donna Meagle,absolutely nothing.
Donna Meagle,What are you wearing?
April Ludgate,"Fine, if you don't wanna donate, then don't."
April Ludgate,"Oh, by the way I'm calling from inside your house."
Chris Traeger,Ha ha!
Chris Traeger,100 dollars.
Jerry Gergich,Whoa.
Chris Traeger,This is unbelievable.
Chris Traeger,I cannot be stopped.
April Ludgate,"I don't care about that prize, but I'm gonna win because I want his happiness to go away."
Tom Haverford,"Type in ""T Rex"" for me."
Tom Haverford,"No, no, no."
Tom Haverford,"Um, ""t boss"""
Tom Haverford,""" Wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,"""Tommy Tsunami."
Tom Haverford,""" No, ""ticky ticky Tom Tom."
Tom Haverford,""" No, ""fly guy."
Ron Swanson,""" I wrote ""tom."
Tom Haverford,""" Classic."
Tom Haverford,Timeless.
Tom Haverford,I love it.
Ann Perkins,"""Girl""?"
Extra,"I saw your ad from when you were a kid, but it's nice to have a beer and get to know you."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, thanks, rich."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here."
Leslie Knope,Smile.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you'll get your picture the pawnee journal.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, this is going really well."
Ben Wyatt,Pretty decent turnout.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you know, I feel very, you know, casual, relaxed."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, is that the guy from the from the focus group?"
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,I think it is.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, sir, would you mind telling me how you heard about the event tonight?"
Derek,"Oh, uh, I got a weird invitation in the mail."
Ben Wyatt,I didn't realize we were sending out invitations.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you're that girl from the focus group thing I did."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I wouldn't know."
Leslie Knope,I'm never on the other side of the glass with those things.
Ben Wyatt,Can I talk to you for a sec?
Leslie Knope,Yep.
Ron Swanson,Straight down the middle.
Ron Swanson,"No hook, no spin, no fuss."
Ron Swanson,Anything more and this becomes figure skating.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, big girl."
Tom Haverford,Let's knock these little pins down.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, are you serious?"
Ron Swanson,"Son, people can see you."
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Tom Haverford,That right there Tommy's strike.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, what happened to the big picture?"
Leslie Knope,I'm thinking about the big picture.
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to make the picture bigger by including this guy in it.
Leslie Knope,"I can't do anything about my gender or my height, but I can win that guy over with a fun round of bowling."
Ben Wyatt,"We need everyone here to see a different side of Leslie Knope, not one specific person."
Ben Wyatt,Some people just aren't gonna like you.
Ben Wyatt,Let it go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hear you."
Leslie Knope,I'll treat him just like everybody else.
Leslie Knope,"I'll just say hi to him, shake his hand, buy a him a few beers, share a few laughs, bowl a few frames, lose intentionally to make him feel good, friend him on Facebook."
Leslie Knope,"And by the end of the night, he will be mine."
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, ""thar"" she bowls."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl?
Leslie Knope,You wanna bowl together?
Leslie Knope,"You wanna be, like, bowl buddies?"
Derek,Sure.
Leslie Knope,"Great, just a casual game, you know?"
Leslie Knope,No biggie.
Derek,You okay?
Derek,"My sister has scoliosis, and I think you might, you know"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm just I'm just being cas."
Leslie Knope,What are you rocking?
Leslie Knope,A 15 pounder?
Derek,16
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, hey, good for you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there they are."
Leslie Knope,I just ordered some wings for us.
Leslie Knope,You like wings?
Derek,Love them.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Who knew?
Leslie Knope,I knew.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Derek,Why are you mad?
Derek,You bowled a strike.
Leslie Knope,"That's how I motivate myself, you know?"
Leslie Knope,Never good enough.
Leslie Knope,Let me get you a beer.
Derek,Cool.
Leslie Knope,These beers are as cold as the Tuktoyaktuk Winter Road.
Derek,You watch Ice Road Truckers?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, dude."
Leslie Knope,It's my guilty pleasure.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, I'm asking you as a man to stop this immediately."
Tom Haverford,Boom!
Ron Swanson,What the [bleep]?
April Ludgate,"Hello, is this Mrs."
April Ludgate,Gallivan?
April Ludgate,"Well, my name is April, and wouldn't you know it, I'm raising money for a city council candidate I believe in."
April Ludgate,"No, mira, mira, mira, mira, mira."
April Ludgate,"It's, like, whatever you want."
April Ludgate,"Like, 10 dollars."
April Ludgate,It don't matter.
April Ludgate,"Well, I reckon it's just like grammy Martha told me and my cousins, ""you can't eat the biscuits if you don't pay for the flour."
Chris Traeger,""" Put the phone down, take a deep breath, and then you are going to tell Steven that you will be treated with respect, okay?"
Chris Traeger,And thank you for your donation.
April Ludgate,"Well, gee, I don't know, Fred."
April Ludgate,"All I know is that I just want to live in a world that's a better place, and your contribution will definitely help us get there, to the Better place world, Fred."
Leslie Knope,Yeehaw!
Leslie Knope,"Man, move over, pins."
Leslie Knope,There's a new Sheriff in town.
Leslie Knope,"You are so down with strikes, they should call you Norma Rae."
Derek,Who's that?
Leslie Knope,It's a Sally Field movie about Unions.
Leslie Knope,Doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, you're really good at this."
Derek,It's your turn.
Derek,Try not to break a nail.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, classic Derek with the Zings."
Leslie Knope,"Man, that's what bowling is all about hey."
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Leslie Knope,It's going really good.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, good."
Leslie Knope,"Um, we're just hanging out and having a very good time."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I just wanted to remind you that when you're bowling, try not to fixate on just one pin."
Ben Wyatt,You're trying to knock down a lot of pins.
Leslie Knope,"I realize that, but I will knock down this pin, and then this pin will knock down all the other pins."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Derek,"Hey, could you get me another one of these?"
Ben Wyatt,I I don't work here.
Leslie Knope,Classic Derek.
Chris Traeger,I am taking a probiotic tea break.
Chris Traeger,"And while that is happening, I thought I might share some big news."
Chris Traeger,I am going to ask Millicent Gergich to move in with me.
Chris Traeger,"I I mean, if that's okay with you of course, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,Of course.
Jerry Gergich,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,"That's awesome, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, do you guys wanna live here with us and Ben and champion, the three legged dog?"
Chris Traeger,That is an amazing offer.
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Chris Traeger,But I think we're probably gonna get our own place.
Chris Traeger,I'm already working with a Real Estate agent to find an octagonal house.
Chris Traeger,"I've done some reading, and an octagon is the optimal shape for a home in terms of energy flow."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, I hate to pull rank, but if you're going to take a break, would you mind going in the living room, just, you know, so it doesn't disturb everybody else."
Chris Traeger,"Jerry, I love it when you pull rank."
April Ludgate,You're being weird.
April Ludgate,Why?
Jerry Gergich,Milli's gonna break up with Chris.
Donna Meagle,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, that's gonna super weird when they move in together."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I don't know when, but she is definitely gonna do it."
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ron."
Tom Haverford,Were you trying to get a seven?
Tom Haverford,"Because if you were, you did a great job."
Ron Swanson,I am very angry right now.
Ann Perkins,What?
Tom Haverford,My finger was in there.
Tom Haverford,Ron crushed my finger.
Tom Haverford,I think it might be broken.
Ann Perkins,Are you a female bird?
Ron Swanson,It was an accident.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, it's already swollen."
Ron Swanson,"Tom, my God, do you have any pride at all?"
Tom Haverford,You did this on purpose.
Tom Haverford,You're jealous of my gift.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, come on, Tweety Bird, let's get you some ice."
Tom Haverford,It hurts.
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Well, congratulations, man."
Leslie Knope,"Fun match, fun game, good times."
Leslie Knope,Did you have fun?
Derek,Yeah.
Derek,I'm not one to complain about free beer and free bowling.
Derek,See you around.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, just one second."
Leslie Knope,"I'm running for city council, as you know, and uh, just wondering, do I have your vote?"
Derek,No.
Leslie Knope,Derek.
Leslie Knope,You old soandso.
Leslie Knope,"For reals, can I count on your vote?"
Derek,"Yeah, no, um, I don't think so."
Leslie Knope,"But we've been here bowling all night, and we've been having fun."
Leslie Knope,And you're still not gonna vote for me?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Derek,"I don't like you, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're a crappy bowler, and I pretended to lose to you."
Derek,"Yeah, right."
Derek,I destroyed you.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's true."
Leslie Knope,I am a really good bowler.
Leslie Knope,Ask Ron.
Derek,I don't know who Ron is.
Derek,"But if you're so great, let's play again."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,I'd love to.
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, if I win, I get your vote."
Derek,"If I win, you clean my house for a month."
Leslie Knope,Done.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,"I'd like to introduce you to my good friend, anyone else."
Leslie Knope,"Not now, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I'd like to introduce Derek's ass to my foot.
Derek,Get me another beer.
Ben Wyatt,I don't work here.
Andy Dwyer,20 dollars?
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, you know, we're really looking for donations more in the $10,000 range."
Millicent Gergich,"Hi, guys."
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Chris Traeger,Just one second.
Chris Traeger,Let me get off this call.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, I'm so sorry."
Chris Traeger,I'm back.
Andy Dwyer,"What, champion?"
Andy Dwyer,You need to go outside now?
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,That a boy.
Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, he's hates awkward situations."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Derek,Terrible moonwalk.
Leslie Knope,Don't care.
Derek,"Yeah, what's up now, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you got a spare."
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Leslie Knope,Check out the scoreboard.
Chris Traeger,"So Millicent and I are going to take a nice little stroll, and I'll be back soon."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, if you want to take the rest of the night off, you know, that would be fine."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I don't think that will be necessary."
Chris Traeger,Unless you also want to go get dinner.
Millicent Gergich,"Nope, this won't take too long."
Donna Meagle,"Chris, you might want to take a jacket with you."
Donna Meagle,It's about to get cold out there.
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, Donna, but Millicent's company will keep me warm."
Donna Meagle,Take the jacket.
April Ludgate,I wished for his happiness to go away.
April Ludgate,I might be a wizard.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Derek."
Leslie Knope,"What a defeat, man."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I did not expect to win by that much."
Leslie Knope,"But I warned you, I am a good bowler."
Derek,Whatever.
Leslie Knope,"All joking aside, I wanna say that I actually had fun."
Leslie Knope,And I'm really looking forward to your vote in the spring.
Derek,"Yeah, I'll just write in ""bitch."""
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
Leslie Knope,Just ignore him.
Leslie Knope,He's being a jerk.
Derek,I said she's a bitch.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Derek,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was awesome.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look."
Leslie Knope,Here's that photo op you wanted.
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,So you know that's everything that happens so it was just what happened.
Ben Wyatt,It was just like 
Police Officer,What's wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, I just I have a lot of adrenaline right now."
Leslie Knope,"Just take a few deep breaths, okay?"
Police Officer,The guy said he might press charges.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, Randy, I would like you to know that we will not be pressing charges."
Police Officer,"Yeah, that really wasn't an option."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, the guy was being a total jerk."
Leslie Knope,"What Ben did was warranted and extremely awesome, by the way."
Leslie Knope,Did you write down how awesome it was?
Police Officer,"When we write official reports, we refrain from using words like ""jerk"" or ""awesome."
Ann Perkins,"""  Hey, here you go."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Wow, you and me, huh?"
Tom Haverford,"Hurt ""fingies."
Tom Haverford,""" No, no, two totally different injuries."
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, you just hang in there, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, love you too."
Jerry Gergich,Bye bye.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that was Milli."
Jerry Gergich,It happened.
Jerry Gergich,She broke up with Chris.
Donna Meagle,Boo.
Andy Dwyer,"Damn you, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,It's not my fault.
Donna Meagle,"Well, I feel sorry for the man."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, anyway, the fundraising challenge is over, and the winner whoa."
Jerry Gergich,"We have a surprise winner, April."
Jerry Gergich,April wins two tickets to the pawnee monoplex.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,That's my wife.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, everything's settled here."
Ann Perkins,Wanna head home?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,We haven't finished yet.
Ron Swanson,"Last frame, your turn."
Ann Perkins,He hurt his hand.
Ron Swanson,"Last frame, go."
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I'll bowl one handed, like an idiot."
Ron Swanson,You need six pins to win.
Tom Haverford,Whoo!
Ron Swanson," Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford, King Kong ain't got nothing on me.
Tom Haverford," Ow, my ""fingie"" still hurts."
Ann Perkins," Oh, the bravery."
Ann Perkins, The perseverance.
Ann Perkins, You're an American hero.
Tom Haverford," And the best part is, beautiful, you get to drive the champion home."
Leslie Knope," Well, the headline I would've gone with is ""no-strike-bowling bowler struck by Knope's striking beau."
Ben Wyatt,""" Okay, one more time."
Ben Wyatt, Let me resign.
Ben Wyatt, It's the only thing that truly protects you.
Leslie Knope,Nonstarter.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Now when you take questions, I think you should be brief and sincere."
Ben Wyatt, Don't try to justify what I did.
Ben Wyatt," Just apologize again, and stay on script."
Ben Wyatt, Are you sure that you don't need more whipped cream?
Leslie Knope,Not today.
Leslie Knope, I don't deserve it.
Leslie Knope, I got us into this mess because I was fixating on that guy.
Leslie Knope, But this is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope, I do need more whipped cream.
Leslie Knope, Ma'am.
April Ludgate, Hi.
Chris Traeger, April Ludgate.
Chris Traeger, How are you doing?
April Ludgate,"Uh, whatever."
April Ludgate, I'm fine.
April Ludgate," Um, how are you?"
Chris Traeger,"Well, as you may know, Millicent Gergich ended our relationship last night, which was disappointing."
Chris Traeger, But here's why it may be the greatest thing that ever happened.
April Ludgate," Yeah, good point."
April Ludgate, Hadn't thought about it that way.
April Ludgate," Um, here."
April Ludgate, Take these tickets.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,you earned them.
April Ludgate," They're movie tickets, Chris."
April Ludgate," They're, like, 8 bucks."
April Ludgate, It's a gesture.
Chris Traeger, There are three of them.
Chris Traeger, I thought there were only two.
April Ludgate," Yeah, I know, I bought another one because I thought that maybe you, me, and Andy could go to the movies sometime."
April Ludgate, Just take the stupid tickets.
April Ludgate, I'm just trying to be nice.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
April Ludgate,There you go.
April Ludgate," Okay, bye."
Extra," Leslie, are you going to fire Ben Wyatt? Are you going to suspend your campaign?"
Leslie Knope,I'd like to first start by saying thank you for coming.
Leslie Knope," And on behalf of Ben Wyatt and everyone involved in my campaign, I'm very sorry for what happened at the rock n' roll bowling alley last night."
Leslie Knope," You know what? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sorry.
Leslie Knope," This guy was drunk, and he was aggressive."
Leslie Knope," And he was rude, and he was foulmouthed."
Leslie Knope," And he called me by my second least favorite term for a woman, and my campaign manager punched him."
Leslie Knope," I do not condone violence, but I have to be honest, it was awesome."
Leslie Knope, And my campaign manager and I made out a lot afterward.
Leslie Knope," Ah, I probably shouldn't have said that."
Leslie Knope, But that's what happened.
Leslie Knope," Derek hates me, and I don't particularly like him."
Leslie Knope," So what's the point, right, Derek?"
Derek,I feel like you're being kind of a bitch right now.
Leslie Knope, See? So I'm not going to apologize.
Leslie Knope," And if people won't vote for me because of that, well, there's nothing I can do about it."
Leslie Knope, But you should be warned.
Leslie Knope," If you do not vote for me, my boyfriend might beat you up."
Leslie Knope," Now if anyone has any questions about the issues facing our city, I'm right here."
Tom Haverford," Okay, what are your overall impressions of this woman?"
Tom Haverford,What do you like about her?
Tom Haverford,What don't you like about her?
Extra,I like her.
Tom Haverford, - What do you like about her specifically?
Extra,I don't know.
Extra," She's tough, I guess."
Extra, I just like her.
Extra," I like that that one guy punched that other guy, and then I like that she stood by him."
Ben Wyatt, See? People vote with their gut.
Leslie Knope," Yeah, that guy said he didn't like my earrings."
Leslie Knope, Go punch him.
Ben Wyatt, Sure.
Extra, Here you go.
Extra, Lane eight.
Ron Swanson," No, Lane 22."
Ron Swanson, The one at the very end.
Ron Swanson, Son of a bitch.
Extra," Hey, perfect game."
Extra, What's your name? Put it up on a wall.
Ron Swanson," I was never here, and you will never speak of this again   "

Leslie Knope,"Okay, time for gifts."
Leslie Knope,"We have gift certificates for facials everybody, then you're gonna get a needlepoint pillow with your face on it and a news headline from a newspaper on the day you were born."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"""Joseph Stalin dies""?"
Leslie Knope,"That's right, Mom, and you replaced him."
Leslie Knope,Though not in terms of genocide.
Leslie Knope,"Just in terms of, you know, being on earth."
Leslie Knope,"February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance, but February 13th, galentine's day, is about celebrating lady friends."
Leslie Knope,"It's wonderful, and it should be a national holiday."
Leslie Knope,It should be a national holiday.
Leslie Knope,"Dear Congress, it's Leslie again."

Ann Perkins,"Well, I'm I'm I'm in a bit of a lull right now, but I'm so glad that you all have people in your lives that you care about, so Congrats!"
Ann Perkins,It's really hard to say congrats without sounding sarcastic.
Ann Perkins,"Seriously, I really hope you guys are all very happy Damn it."
April Ludgate,We are.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I put you on the spot when I asked you about your love life."
Leslie Knope,How are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"You know, I'm mostly fine being single."
Ann Perkins,"It's just this time of year with the hearts and roses, it just gets me a little down."

Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Great attitude, Ron."

Leslie Knope,"Okay, so the Valentine's Day dance is planned, prepped, and under budget, but we have one final task."
Leslie Knope,"Ann Perkins is currently attending the Valentine's Day dance alone, so I need each one of you to bring an eligible bachelor for her tomorrow."
April Ludgate,Ann's not totally hideous.
April Ludgate,Why does she need our help?
Leslie Knope,"Because that's what friends do, April."
Leslie Knope,They help friends find happiness.
Leslie Knope,"Now the last guy she liked was Chris, but she can't date him again because he's her boss."
Leslie Knope,"So when we're thinking of prospective sweethearts, we need to think of people who are Attractive and smart and kind."
Leslie Knope,"And if you're wondering what kind of guy is right for Ann, all you need to do is ask."
Leslie Knope,"Also you need to find someone educated, and friendly, and fun"
Ron Swanson,just tell us the damn word.
Leslie Knope,"Effervescent, he needs to be effervescent."
Tom Haverford,Quick question about Ann does anyone know if she has any indian in her?
Leslie Knope,No one respond.
Leslie Knope,No one say anything.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Tom Haverford,I'm just curious if Ann  has a little indian in her.
Leslie Knope,Silence.
Jerry Gergich,I don't think she does.
Tom Haverford,Would she like some?
April Ludgate,Jerry!
Ben Wyatt,Happy Valentine's Day.
Ben Wyatt,And Oohah!
Leslie Knope,Yachter Otter?
Leslie Knope,Yup.
Leslie Knope,"Two months ago, I have a dream about a playboy otter lost at sea, and you make him real?"
Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,I thought we had agreed that we weren't gonna get each other presents because we were too busy with the campaign I got you something too.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, a bomb?"
Leslie Knope,"It is a cryptex, like in that movie The Da Vinci Code, which was the first movie that you and I ever watched  on Starz HD."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, that's specific."
Leslie Knope,Inside it will tell you where to meet me at 9:00 P.M.
Leslie Knope,"tonight, and the combination is a fiveletter code that captures the essence of our third date."
Leslie Knope,Yeah  So I will see you tonight.
Leslie Knope,Unless You can't crack the code.
Ben Wyatt,I think I can crack the code.
Ben Wyatt,I have no idea what the code is.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, you okay?"
Tom Haverford,Still thinking about your ex?
Chris Traeger,Millicent Gergich has literally torn my heart from my body and replaced it with a thick slab of sadness.
Chris Traeger,I may never smile again.
Tom Haverford,"Cool, so I found a DJ for the dance, and his name is DJ Bluntz."
Chris Traeger,"Tom, this is a publicly funded couples dance."
Chris Traeger,"I don't think it's appropriate for people to be getting ""wet with sound."""
Tom Haverford,"Who's gonna do it, then?"
Chris Traeger,I will.
Chris Traeger,"I certainly have no other plans for Valentine's Day, because I am completely alone."
Tom Haverford,"All right, I'll see you later, Chris."
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, cool cryptex, can I have it?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, no."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you can't"
Andy Dwyer,Where'd you get it?
Ben Wyatt,How do you know what a cryptex is?
Andy Dwyer,I know what things are.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie hid the location of our Valentine's meeting place  in here."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Ben Wyatt,I tried every fiveletter word that has anything to do with our third date.
Andy Dwyer,Have you tried [Bleep]?
Ben Wyatt,That's a four letter word.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Add an ""s""?"
Ben Wyatt,I really don't think it's that.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, I wish I could help you, bro, I don't know if I can."
Andy Dwyer,"You're, like, the second smartest guy I know."
Andy Dwyer,You should go to the first smartest guy I know.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so the clue is inside, but it takes a fiveletter code to open it Andy!"
Ron Swanson,Did you try [bleep]?
Andy Dwyer,Ha!
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, why is that everyone's first suggestion?"
Andy Dwyer,Just smart people.
Ron Swanson,I think I might be able to help you.
Andy Dwyer,Told you.
Ben Wyatt,Let me see it!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you're gonna see it."
Andy Dwyer,I'll show you.
Andy Dwyer,I can unroll it.
Andy Dwyer,"""The murals with this heart you see, look to the first, and there your next clue will be."
Ron Swanson,""" The first letter of the name of each mural with a heart on it will spell out the clue."
Ron Swanson,Or some or something.
Ron Swanson,Let's check out the murals.
Chris Traeger,"Happy Valentine's Day, Pawnee."
Chris Traeger,"For me, it is not happy."
Chris Traeger,But don't let my sadness diminish your night.
Chris Traeger,"Anyway, life is fleeting."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Jerry Gergich,Found a date for Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, well done."
Jerry Gergich,"I put an ad on Craigslist: ""Man seeking man for a night of casual fun."
Jerry Gergich,""" Enrico, he responded right away."
Extra,"I'll meet you inside, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Tom Haverford,You hired a male escort.
Jerry Gergich,A what?
Leslie Knope,Please get your gigolo out of here.
Jerry Gergich,"I uh oh, my God."

Andy Dwyer,"All right, the ones from the other hallway are ""Cornfield Slaughter,"" ""Lament of the Buffalo,"" ""Needless Slaughter,"" ""Slaughter Gone Wrong,"" ""Eating the Reverend,"" ""It's Raining Blood,""  and ""Death Everywhere."
Ben Wyatt,"""  Great."
Ben Wyatt,I got it from here.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, guys."
Ben Wyatt,I hope I didn't screw up your Valentine's Day too much.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God, no."
Andy Dwyer,April hates Valentine's Day.
Andy Dwyer,And brunch.
Andy Dwyer,And outside.
Andy Dwyer,And smiling.
Andy Dwyer,She's weird.
Ron Swanson,Wait.
Ron Swanson,I figured it out.
Ron Swanson,"The letters unscrambled say, ""No food finer."
Ron Swanson,Clue three at J.J.'s Diner.
Ron Swanson,""" How many clues are there, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
April Ludgate,And I brought a bachelor.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,You brought Orin?
Leslie Knope,"Ann is not some weird, morose mummy."
Leslie Knope,"Offense intended, Orin."
Leslie Knope,Let this be a wakeup call about the way you present yourself to the world.
April Ludgate,I think Ann and him would be cute together.
Leslie Knope,I ask you to do one thing.
Leslie Knope,Do you know how hard I've been working to try to pull this together before Ann gets here?
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you're here."
Leslie Knope,We weren't talking about you.
Leslie Knope,How are you?
Ann Perkins,"Well It's Valentine's Day, and I'm single, and I'm at a couples dance."
Ann Perkins,I can't imagine a more depressing place to be.
Leslie Knope,"What about a wedding where you used to go out with the groom, and you're the only one there without a date, so the bride makes you dance to Single Ladies by yourself?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, did that happen to you?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,"Let's get a drink, and then you and I are gonna have some fun."
Ann Perkins,"Well, at least the music seems about right."
Leslie Knope,"There was supposed to be, like, 20 guys here for Ann, and there's only four."
Leslie Knope,Who else do we have?
Leslie Knope,"Ben, taken."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, taken."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"My dentist Is 80, and he's gay, and he's taken."
Leslie Knope,Uh what's this?
Leslie Knope,P. Hut
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Pizza Hut!"
Leslie Knope,"Hold on Hi, how cute are you?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, this is my lawyer friend, Alex."
Extra,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Extra,Nice to meet you.
Ann Perkins,Nice to meet you.
Extra,I've heard a lot about you  In the last hour.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Alex gives my campaign legal advice, and Ann is the greatest human being ever invented."
Leslie Knope,So I'm gonna what?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, someone needs me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go, and you two just hit it off now."
Leslie Knope,You crazy kids.
Extra,Okay Okay
Ben Wyatt,There is no food finer.
Ben Wyatt,""" For Leslie, that means whipped cream, or No, it's whipped cream."
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna look in the whipped cream cans.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, got some!"
Andy Dwyer,Oh Nothing yet.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, ""something wicked this way comes,"" ""whence you peruse a book with your thumbs."
Ben Wyatt,"""Go to the one who succumbs."
Ben Wyatt,I'll be attached with a little gum.
Ben Wyatt,""" Oh, come on, Leslie, gimme a break."
Ron Swanson,"I hate riddles and other such nonsense, I want that on the record."
Ron Swanson,"But something wicked with a book is my exwife, from the library."
Ron Swanson,Which means I'm the one that succumbs.
Ben Wyatt,Uh I'll be attached with a little gum.
Ron Swanson,""" Good God."
Ron Swanson,That woman is good.
Ron Swanson,"""Follow me to the sheltered snow."
Ron Swanson,Only 22 clues left to go.
Ben Wyatt,""" Well, this is the woman I've chosen to love."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I guess there's nothing to do but spend the entire night methodically solving this puzzle."
Ben Wyatt,There's no way we'll finish in time.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just make a list of places she and I have been together, and hope we luck out and find the last clue."
Ron Swanson,"We'll split up, cover more ground."
Ron Swanson,Move.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Kriss Kross, can we change up the music?"
Tom Haverford,It kind of sounds like the end of a movie about a monk who killed himself.
Chris Traeger,It is.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, man There's some attractive women here."
Tom Haverford,Why don't you rebound?
Chris Traeger,Nobody here compares to Millicent.
Chris Traeger,Except maybe Jerry.
Chris Traeger,Technically they share 50% of the same DNA.
Tom Haverford,Stop staring at Jerry like that.
Extra,I don't know.
Extra,It's working now.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how's it going?"
Extra,"It's Valentine's Day, and I'm working the late shift of the snow globe museum, so I'm right where I wanna be."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, um, my girlfriend left a clue here, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Like, for a scavenger hunt."
Extra,Right.
Extra,You're Ben.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Extra,She said you'd be here by noon.
Extra,Not doing so good.
Ben Wyatt,"All right, well."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Kevin."
Extra,I'm supposed to tell you that it's under one of the snow globes.
Extra,But which one?
Extra,"Ooh, I don't know."
Extra,Nope.
Extra,No.
Extra,No.
Extra,You really suck at this.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, why don't you just Tell me where it is and I can get out of here?"
Extra,That would take all the fun out of it.
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Extra,Winner.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, ha, ha, ha."
Ben Wyatt,I found it.
Extra,Yep.
Extra,"Oh, wait."
Extra,"No, that might be from another scavenger hunt."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, looks like you already met Jeff."
Extra,"Well, you didn't tell me that your friend was so beautiful."
Ann Perkins,"Aww, thanks, Jeff."
Extra,"Not as beautiful as my sister, but you know the law."
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,"No, Jeff."
Leslie Knope,How am I supposed to find the love of Ann's life when it sounds like a funeral in here?
Tom Haverford,There's no changing it as long as Chris is depressed.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go talk to Chris.
Leslie Knope,You go help Ann.
Leslie Knope,"She's not responding to my top candidates, so we're gonna have to go with some wild cards."
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Leslie Knope,And April Thanks for nothing.
Leslie Knope,Why should I do anything to help her?
Leslie Knope,"Because despite the fact that all you do is give her a hard time, she would do this for you."
Leslie Knope,Just go hide under the table with your friend Orin.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I see you, weirdo."
Ann Perkins,"So Leslie dragged you into this sneaky little fixup scheme, huh?"
Tom Haverford,We're stuck at a Parks and Rec community couples event.
Tom Haverford,What else you gotta do?
Ann Perkins,What the hell.
Ann Perkins,You're right.
Ann Perkins,"Bring 'em on, Tom."
Harris,I'm Harris.
Harris,Heard you were desperate for a manpiece.
Harris,We in business?
Tom Haverford,"He's 33 years old, still lives with his parents, and he's been to at least 200 Phish concerts"
Harris,Try 308.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna have to pass right now.
Harris,"Your mistake, mama."
Tom Haverford,"So, Bill, this stunning woman saves lives for a living."
Tom Haverford,What do you bring to the table?
Extra,"Uh, where to begin?"
Extra,"Uh, I'm an amateur juggler"
Tom Haverford,"Nope, you shouldn't have begun there."
Tom Haverford,Get out.
Tom Haverford,No one's trying to get with jugglers.
Tom Haverford,Thanks for playing.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, my name is Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,I believe Leslie Knope may have left some kind of scavenger hunt clue here.
Extra,She did.
Extra,One second.
Ron Swanson,Gentlemen.
Ron Swanson,Ah .
Ron Swanson,Enjoy your evening.
Andy Dwyer,"Well it always says ""Break glass in case of an emergency."
Andy Dwyer,""" Wait a second."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, there we go."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Chris, what do you think about changing the music?"
Chris Traeger,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,You should look on the bright side.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sure that Millicent couldn't keep up with you on your runs, so now you can go full speed again."
Chris Traeger,"On the contrary, she was faster than I was."
Chris Traeger,I set many personal bests just trying to keep up with her.
Chris Traeger,Which is what I'm worried about.
Chris Traeger,What if she was my personal best?
Leslie Knope,"No, your best is still ahead of you."
Chris Traeger,I am 44 years old.
Leslie Knope,You don't look a day over 30.
Chris Traeger,Most people say 25.
Leslie Knope,Who says that?
Chris Traeger,Lot of people.
Chris Traeger,You don't think that Millicent was my soul mate?
Leslie Knope,There are a lot of soul mates in the world.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at Ann."
Leslie Knope,"You dated her, and she's a perfect human specimen, and you tossed her out like day old chowder."
Leslie Knope,But it's gonna be okay.
Leslie Knope,Buck up.
Chris Traeger,"Thanks, I'll try."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,How is your evening unfolding in terms of your conversations with men?
Ann Perkins,I have met a lot of different guys tonight.
Leslie Knope,How lucky that that happened to you  on Valentine's Day.
Ann Perkins,What's lucky is that I have a best friend who spent her Valentine's Day trying to find me a date.
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go home.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Stay.
Ann Perkins,I just I'm gonna go home and watch TV.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, can you just do me a favor and give me your car keys for a second?"
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to look at on your car keys.
Ann Perkins,You're gonna throw them on the roof again  so I can't leave.
Leslie Knope,You know me too well.
Ann Perkins,You're the best.
Leslie Knope,"It sucks being alone on Valentine's Day, so I'm gonna take Ann out for a drink, you know."
Leslie Knope,Try to cheer her up.
Leslie Knope,And I can be late meeting Ben.
Leslie Knope,"He's not gonna be on time, 'cause those clues are hard."
Leslie Knope,"They're really, really hard, and I'm really worried that he's not gonna be able to figure it out."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky bastard."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, what are you doing?"
Leslie Knope,Look at Ann.
Leslie Knope,She's putting on makeup.
Leslie Knope,She using the emergency mini curling iron that I gave her.
Leslie Knope,She has a date.
April Ludgate,You don't know that.
Leslie Knope,Why wouldn't she tell me who it is?
Leslie Knope,Because she doesn't want me to know.
Leslie Knope,Because it's someone she shouldn't be dating.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, the music's better."
Leslie Knope,Have you seen Chris?
April Ludgate,"I don't know, maybe he's in the bathroom or something."
Leslie Knope,She's going to meet Chris.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I got nine, three and four."
Ron Swanson,"I have 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ron Swanson,I got I got lucky.
Ron Swanson,And I love riddles.
Andy Dwyer,"Yo, found some clues."
Andy Dwyer,Also found this.
Andy Dwyer,Weird stick.
Andy Dwyer,Might be a clue.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Did you find the 25th clue?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I got #8, and #22."
Leslie Knope,"What do you want, April?"
April Ludgate,Leave Ann alone.
April Ludgate,This is none of your business.
Leslie Knope,"After all the hoops that Ben and I had to jump through because of the boss employee thing, it is absolutely my business."
Leslie Knope,"Chris needs to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, so many injustices."
April Ludgate,"Ann would never do anything to piss you off, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"You guys are such close friends, it's lame."
April Ludgate,"Just have a nice night with Ben, and forget about this."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,I will let it go for now.
Leslie Knope,"But I want you to know that I think there is some Okay, she hung up on me."
Ron Swanson,We failed.
Ron Swanson,If I just had a little more time.
Ben Wyatt,"She's waiting for me somewhere in Pawnee,  and I'm not gonna be there."
Ron Swanson,"Wait Leslie loves romance, but she also loves being right."
Ron Swanson,"Is there something you used to disagree on, but you've since come around to her way of thinking?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, you're a genius."
Leslie Knope,Little Sebastian.
Leslie Knope,"At first you did not understand what made this tiny horse so special, and now you love him more than I do."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, I miss him every day."
Leslie Knope, I really tried to make that hard.
Leslie Knope, I'm very impressed with you.
Ben Wyatt," Eh, some of them were kind of tough."
Ben Wyatt, So are you ready to go have our first ever Valentine's dinner?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but I have to tell you something."
Leslie Knope, Chris and Ann are on a secret date.
Leslie Knope," Which is crazy because he's her boss, which is the exact situation we were in, except we were put on trial for it."
Leslie Knope," And I know I'm not supposed to care, and I'm supposed to let it go, and we should just have a romantic dinner"
Ben Wyatt,"No, we have to go catch them in the act."
Ben Wyatt,Right now.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt, Screw romantic dinners.
Ben Wyatt, Let's go rub it in their face.
Leslie Knope," God, I love you so much."
Leslie Knope, I cannot wait to see the look on Chris' remarkably youthful face when we march in there and confront him
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt, What?
Leslie Knope, Ahh! Shh.
Ben Wyatt,Shh.
Leslie Knope,April.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Leslie Knope,April.
Leslie Knope,Tom and Ann are on a date.
April Ludgate, I know.
Leslie Knope, What do you mean you know? How do you know?
April Ludgate,Because I set them up.
April Ludgate, I was watching Ann with Tom at the dance and she seemed to be having a good time.
April Ludgate, So I went over to talk to her.
April Ludgate, What are you looking for in a date anyway?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins," What does anyone want? Just a nice, funny guy who likes me and treats me well."
April Ludgate," Tom's funny, and he'd treat you well."
Ann Perkins,"Ha, ha."
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate," You want a good date, why not ask out the only guy that's made you smile tonight?"
Ann Perkins,He's ridiculous.
Ann Perkins,All that dumb swagger.
April Ludgate, It's not.
April Ludgate, He's sweet.
April Ludgate, You should just ask him out for a drink.
April Ludgate," I'm 1,000% sure he'd say yes."
April Ludgate, I bet you guys would have a good time.
Ben Wyatt," Man, I need to, like, wrap my head around this."
April Ludgate, Why? It makes sense to me.
April Ludgate," This is a small, loser town with loser people, and Tom's, like, at least semi-cool."
Leslie Knope, You know what I'm hearing? You tried to make Ann happy for Valentine's Day.
April Ludgate,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,You're a very nice person.
April Ludgate, No.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you are."
Leslie Knope,Very nice person.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Leslie Knope, I do not understand this.
Leslie Knope, This really confuses me.
Ben Wyatt," Well, you do love them both."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, I love passionate speakers and Italian men."
Leslie Knope, Doesn't mean I love Mussolini.
Ben Wyatt, You love Italian men?
Leslie Knope,Not as much as Irish Scottish? White whatever you are.
Leslie Knope, This is the weirdest Valentine's Day ever.
Tom Haverford," So, Ann, it's finally happening."
Ann Perkins," Dude, this is so close to falling apart."
Tom Haverford," Okay, okay, I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford," Can I be honest, though? I'm a little freaked out."
Tom Haverford," Like, I don't really understand what's going on."
Ann Perkins," This is what's going on, we're gonna have a drink, and we're gonna talk, get to know each other."
Ann Perkins, And then I am going to drive home alone.
Tom Haverford, Cool.
Tom Haverford," Consider this alternate plan, we have drinks here, get to know each other, whatever."
Tom Haverford, Then we go back to my place and snuggle up Like little bunnies.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, this was a mistake."
Tom Haverford,No!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, thanks to your annoying prying last year, I'm sure you remember my birthday's coming up."
Leslie Knope," I know, I know."
Leslie Knope," No parties, you hate parties."
Ron Swanson, Correct.
Ron Swanson," Oh, you know that wild goose chase you sent Ben on for Valentine's Day?"
Leslie Knope,The scavenger hunt?
Ron Swanson,I also do not want that.
Leslie Knope,"Yep, I understand."
Ron Swanson," I absolutely do not want to solve a series of riddles and clues, each more intricate than the last."
Ron Swanson, You understand what I'm saying?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I got it, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Good.
Ron Swanson," Uh, I, I do want that."
Ron Swanson, Please do that for me.

Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Booboo bear."
Ann Perkins,What did you just call me?
Tom Haverford,Booboo bear.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"It's one of several nicknames I made up for you, and you can choose which one you like best, 'cause I want this to be a give and take."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we went out once, and nothing happened."
Ann Perkins,"There is no ""this."

Tom Haverford,"All right, let's do this."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,Is this not one of those?
Tom Haverford,I might have misread the vibe.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, dude, you have to be cooler about this."
Ann Perkins,"Look, I told Leslie because she's my best friend, but if anybody finds out about this and they start jabbering, it's gonna make it really hard to know if this is actually anything, so just keep it on the DL, okay?"
Tom Haverford,I feel like you're embarrassed by me.
Ann Perkins,That is accurate.
Tom Haverford,"Can I at least change my Facebook status to ""In a relationship""?"
Ann Perkins,Definitely not.
Tom Haverford,"""It's complicated""?"
Ann Perkins,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,Am I in a relationship?

Leslie Knope,I'm really nervous because I need this for my campaign.
Leslie Knope,And Ben is really nervous because he is afraid of cops.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not afraid of cops.
Ben Wyatt,I have no reason to be.
Ben Wyatt,"I never break any laws, ever Because I'm deathly afraid of cops."
Chief Trumple,"Look, Knope, I've always liked you."
Chief Trumple,But the Newports run this town.
Chief Trumple,"And frankly, they've donated a lot of money to the department."
Ben Wyatt,"Mo' money, mo' problems, that's what I always say."
Chief Trumple,"How about ""mo' money, more protective kevlar vests""  that save lives""?"
Ben Wyatt,"I Sometimes I say that, too."
Leslie Knope,"I understand you need to think about it, but if you were going to make a decision"
Chief Trumple,The guys are throwing me a little retirement thing tonight at O'Flynnigans.
Chief Trumple,There's gonna be beer.
Chief Trumple,So why don't you swing by?

April Ludgate,"Listen up, people."
April Ludgate,This is very serious.
April Ludgate,"Jerry, if you're eating, you're not listening."
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know how many of you have heard, but there's a flesheating virus going around."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"It's called ""music,"" and there's only one way to get a vaccine, and that is to play it."
Andy Dwyer,To play the you get an injection
Ron Swanson,"Just say your piece, son."
Andy Dwyer,I have finished writing Leslie's campaign anthem.
Andy Dwyer,"It's called Catch Your Dream, and it's amazing."
Andy Dwyer,"It's kind of like We Are The World, except I actually think it could have a real impact on society."
Andy Dwyer,"Here's the thing we need backup singers, and I thought, ""who better to be backup singers than Leslie's campaign team?"""
Andy Dwyer,Everyone's got something they're in charge of for Leslie's campaign.
Andy Dwyer,My job is the song.
Andy Dwyer,"She originally put me in charge of hot dogs at this fundraising barbecue, and I dropped them all all of them, like a thousand, so I really want to do a good job."
Andy Dwyer,"So we're gonna record this bitch tonight, 6 o'clock Doubletime Studio."
Ron Swanson,"Doubletime, you said?"
Ron Swanson,Little brick building over on Liondale Road?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you know the one?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,You could not keep it together in there.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm fine now, as long as we get out of here as quickly as possible and never come back."
Dave Sanderson,"Hey, Leslie!"
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Dave.

Leslie Knope,"So what are you oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Um, Ben, this, uh this is my this is Dave Sanderson."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey."
Dave Sanderson,Nice to meet you.
Dave Sanderson,"Uh, yes, uh, Leslie Knope is a female person with whom I was involved."
Dave Sanderson,"We had a romantic ""romantical"" involvement until I relocated to San Diego, which is that's in California, which is southwest of here by a number of miles."
Dave Sanderson,So we terminated our involvement at that time.
Leslie Knope,Are you here for a while?
Dave Sanderson,"No, just tonight, for the chief's retirement thing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, we're going to that, too, actually, but we're gonna go a little later, because first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice new French restaurant."
Dave Sanderson,Cool.
Dave Sanderson,I'm gonna go to the gas station and get a frozen burrito and eat it right there at that table.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, see you later."
Leslie Knope,You should come to dinner with us.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I shouldn't have invited him.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no No, that's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I just feel like it's kind of odd for me and him to hang out with you."
Ben Wyatt,"Honestly, if you want to just go out with him alone, I'd be totally okay with it."
Leslie Knope,"No, look, he's here for one night."
Leslie Knope,"He's a really great guy, and he's gonna love you, which bonus will make all the other cops love you."
Leslie Knope,"Dave is a great person, and he's a great judge of character."
Leslie Knope,"Tonight he's going to endorse Ben, and Trumple is going to endorse me."
Leslie Knope,Double endorsement.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, that sounds like an Ashley Judd movie."
Andy Dwyer,Studio's down here.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,"Hustle, people, come on."
Andy Dwyer,Jerry Ah.
April Ludgate,That's vandalism.
Ron Swanson,I have a problem.
Ron Swanson,This happens to be the studio where a local saxophone legend named Duke Silver records his albums.
April Ludgate,I've heard of him.
April Ludgate,I heard he makes mature women swoon when he plays.
Ron Swanson,"From what I've heard about Duke, he's kind of a private guy."
Ron Swanson,He doesn't want his nosy coworkers discussing his music with him or knowing that he exists.
Ron Swanson,"So, if you happen to see any memorabilia laying around, kindly and discreetly discard it."
April Ludgate,"You got it, Duke."
Ron Swanson,Don't call me that.
April Ludgate,"I dig your groovy tunes, man."
April Ludgate,Did you hear me?
April Ludgate,"I said, ""I dig your groovy tunes, man."""
Andy Dwyer,"Yo, Chuck, we're going to go ahead and play and sing at the same time."
Andy Dwyer,I want this to have the electricity of a live concert.
Burly,So we have to play it perfectly every time?
Andy Dwyer,"No, Burly, play it ""unperfectly."""
Burly,You mean imperfectly?
Andy Dwyer,I mean perfectly.
April Ludgate,"God, that was hot nonsense."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, uh, can I have a sip of that water?"

Tom Haverford,As soon as I possibly could.
Tom Haverford,I texted them while we were on the date.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"But you are too hot to hide, Ann."
Tom Haverford,This is on you.

Donna Meagle,"When you two spoon, who spoons who?"
Leslie Knope,Ben's doing an amazing job as campaign manager.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,He's really smart.
Dave Sanderson,"You know, a campaign manager is only as good as the campaign person that he is managing."
Dave Sanderson,So I'm trying to say you're a real smart lady.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, you can say that again."
Ben Wyatt,"If anything, I'm holding her back."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, Ben."
Dave Sanderson,I said my thing first.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, that's why we were at the police station today."
Ben Wyatt,We're trying to get Chief Trumple's endorsement.
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, yeah?"
Dave Sanderson,He was a buddy of mine.
Dave Sanderson,I could probably get him to endorse you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man, that would be amazing."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Dave Sanderson,"Uh, you mean ""the whiz palace."""

Dave Sanderson,Nothing was just now
Leslie Knope,Did you just say you were still in love with me?
Dave Sanderson,"No, I don't think I said that."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, why would you tell me that here and now?"
Dave Sanderson,Because it's accurate.
Dave Sanderson,"And because he's not here right now, so I thought this would be a good time."
Dave Sanderson,Can I just please talk to you about this for five minutes?
Leslie Knope,"No, you cannot bring this up at all when my boyfriend is here."
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, we'll get rid of him."
Dave Sanderson,That's a good call.
Leslie Knope,"No, bad call."
Leslie Knope,That's not the call.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, if we leave now while he's in the whiz palace"
Leslie Knope," No, listen to me."
Ben Wyatt,Listen Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Whizzingham manor.

All,Catch your dream
All,and shackle it to your heart.
All,Catch your
Andy Dwyer,"No, no, no, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,Was that a joke?
Andy Dwyer,Were you joking just now?
Andy Dwyer,"Because if so, that was hilariously awfully funny how bad that was."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you take and really think about whether or not you want to be part of this?
April Ludgate,"He's a gorgeous genius, people."
April Ludgate,Don't question his methods.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, am I to understand correctly that you are now romantically involved with Ann Perkins?"
Tom Haverford,Tsk.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, are you about to give me the whole ""she's a great girl, I need to treat her right"" speech,  since you guys used to date?"
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,"But she is, and you should."
Chris Traeger,"I just had no idea, and so now I have to Adjust."
Tom Haverford,Tsk.

Leslie Knope,"Oh, it was so good to see you."
Dave Sanderson,But I may be coming back.
Leslie Knope,"How's that, now?"
Dave Sanderson,"Well, I'm mainly here to interview for Trumple's job  Police chief."
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, that's amazing."
Ben Wyatt,You should totally be chief.
Ben Wyatt,You could endorse Leslie.
Dave Sanderson,I would definitely endorse Leslie.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to.
Leslie Knope,There's a lot of good candidates.
Dave Sanderson,I think I'm gonna take a little go outside.
Dave Sanderson,You look like I could use some company.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,What?
Dave Sanderson,Would you like to step outside with me and catch up?
Leslie Knope,We have caught up.
Leslie Knope,We talked about San Diego and about the six bad guys.
Leslie Knope,I think we're good.

Dave Sanderson,"No, I don't want that."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, I'm already I already said I'm gonna go, so I guess I'm a man of my word."
Dave Sanderson,I'm gonna go.

Dave Sanderson,"Okay, thank you."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, honestly, how do you think I'm doing?"
Ben Wyatt,Because I feel like we're getting along pretty well.

Leslie Knope,"While you were in the bathroom, he said he was still in love with me."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, he's a cop."
Ben Wyatt,"He's in love with you, and he has a gun?"
Leslie Knope,Can you just not freak out?

Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not freaking Uh
Ben Wyatt,"I know, that's I know."
Dave Sanderson,"Uh, it was raining out, so I didn't want to get wet."
Andy Dwyer,I got some hot tea with honey good for the voice.
Andy Dwyer,I recommend you all try it.
Andy Dwyer,"Mine's really just a cup of honey, cause tea is gross."
Andy Dwyer,"Now, here's the thing we're gonna start from scratch."
Andy Dwyer,We're gonna get rid of this whole sucky vibe.
Andy Dwyer,I'm thinking we could
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,To the man!
April Ludgate,"I was thinking, like, a crazy rock star vibe!"
Andy Dwyer,See where her head's at?
Andy Dwyer,Follow her lead.
Andy Dwyer,That was amazing.
Andy Dwyer,"Next thing, I want to hear how all of us sing on our own, so we can figure out where we're going wrong."
Andy Dwyer,"This is not an audition, so relax."
Andy Dwyer,"But if you don't sing good, you're out of here."
Tom Haverford,"I think you sound like an angel, and everyone else sounds like demons."
Ann Perkins,I think you shouldn't whisper.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, Ann's mad at me now, but I have a few tricks up my sleeve."
Tom Haverford,"I don't want to brag, but I have a ton of experience with women being mad at me."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, you're first."

Dave Sanderson,Why don't you get a dessert?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, dessert's overrated and gross."
Leslie Knope,"Dave, thank you so much for a lovely evening."
Dave Sanderson,"Oh, actually, Ben, would you mind if I talked to Leslie alone?"
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, actually, Dave, I'd like to talk to you."
Dave Sanderson,I don't want to talk to you.
Dave Sanderson,I want to talk to Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I want to talk to you, and if not, then I'd like to talk to Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'd like to talk to Ben, and then I'd like the three of us to talk together."
Dave Sanderson,"Well, then I'll talk to Ben, and then you and then I'll talk to you, and then you'll talk to each other, and then we'll all three talk, then."
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,So who's talking now?
All,Catch your dream  don't let it spread its wings and fly away  
Tom Haverford,"Stop the song, stop the song right now!"
Tom Haverford,"Please, stop it!"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, for [Bleep] sake."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I caught feelings for you, and I want you to be my girl And I don't care who knows."
Ann Perkins,"I know you don't care, dummy."
Ann Perkins,I care.
Tom Haverford,Let's not get hung up on who wants what.
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,I'm calling this.
Ann Perkins,We're done.
Tom Haverford,What about our next date?
Tom Haverford,"If you want another date, keep walking away."
Tom Haverford,She's still walking.
Dave Sanderson,"I need you to know something, man to man."
Dave Sanderson,"I still have feelings for Leslie, in a womanly fashion, and I believe she feels the same towards me, in a manly way."
Ben Wyatt,"She doesn't feel the same way, because she has a boyfriend um, me, and and and and we love each other."
Dave Sanderson,"That's that information is it's not pertinent  Well, I  Frankly, at this juncture."
Dave Sanderson,"I just said to you one thing, and you're ""contraring"" me."
Ben Wyatt,I don't think that's a word.
Dave Sanderson,I think we'd all appreciate it if you would just let me have three minutes with her alone.
Dave Sanderson,"Consequently, I'd like you to clear the area."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna give my blessing for you to go and try and win my girlfriend away from me."
Ben Wyatt,I think that that's reasonable.
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, and I want to thank you."
Dave Sanderson,I want to thank you for having this talk with me Man to man.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you."
Dave Sanderson,Thank you very much.
Ben Wyatt,What  what are you doing?
Dave Sanderson,I'm doing that.
Ben Wyatt,Are you serious?
Dave Sanderson,You brought it on yourself.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Dave Sanderson,I've got something I gotta say to you.
Leslie Knope,Where's Ben?
Dave Sanderson,He left.
Leslie Knope,He left?
Dave Sanderson,"Yeah, he said, ""I got somewhere I got to important to go, and I don't respect her as a woman."""
Leslie Knope,He said that?
Dave Sanderson,And he acted more effeminate than he does in front of you.
Dave Sanderson,"Just look, I got some something to say, and it's emotional, and it's important."
Dave Sanderson,I need 30 seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what?"
Leslie Knope,Go ahead.
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Dave Sanderson,Okay.
Dave Sanderson,Romance
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I have to pee really bad, ironically."
Leslie Knope,What were you thinking?
Dave Sanderson,"I was thinking that I would cuff him, andand then I could have time to speak to you, and then you would decide to be with me, and then I would come back here, and we would uncuff him together."
Leslie Knope,"Can you just uncuff him, please?"
Dave Sanderson,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,Would you look at that?
Tom Haverford,Nature is throwing me a bone.
Tom Haverford,"Haverford playbook move number two ""ladies love a guy waiting for them in the rain."
Ron Swanson,"I never thought I'd say this to you, son, but you may be overthinking this."
Andy Dwyer,"This song has to be perfect, Ron, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,Leslie trusted me with it.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't come up with some brilliant political idea, can I?"
Andy Dwyer,This is the only way I can help.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe if I hit my head against the ground.
Andy Dwyer,That's worked before.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie is going to love it, I promise."
Andy Dwyer,"No offense, Ron, but what do you know about music?"
Ron Swanson,Mm.
Ron Swanson,Tsk.
Ron Swanson,"Hey, take a walk."
Ron Swanson,Clear your head.
Ron Swanson,I bet it does you some good.
Tom Haverford,Ann?
Tom Haverford,Booboo?
Leslie Knope,"I don't want to say, ""I told you so,""  but "
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I was the one who didn't want to go.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"He was a very important person to me, and it mattered to me that he liked you, which is silly."
Leslie Knope,Let's just go home.
Ben Wyatt," No, we're going to Trumple's thing."
Leslie Knope," No, let's not go there."
Leslie Knope," I don't care about the endorsement, and I don't want to put you through this any more."
Ben Wyatt," You don't care about the endorsement? Leslie, let's not let your terrible decision making get in the way of this election."
Ann Perkins, What happened to you?
Tom Haverford," I was waiting outside in the rain for you, 'cause I thought you would come out and be like, ""aw, he's all wet."""
Tom Haverford," ""That's so romantic,"" but you didn't, and now I got the sniffies."
Ann Perkins,What on earth would make you think I would like that?
Tom Haverford,Movies.
Ann Perkins," Oh, God, Tom! Why do you have to be so ""you"" all the time?"
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford, Will you help me get out of these wet clothes?
Extra,"Hey, you want a beer? "
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Extra," If you're driving, I can't give you a beer."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, well, then, no, thank you."
Extra," It's a celebration, man."
Extra, You have to have a drink.
Ben Wyatt, I'll definitely have one.
Extra, Don't make a mistake you'll always regret.
Ben Wyatt," Please, just tell me what you want me to do."
Leslie Knope," So, if you move here, I hope we can be friends, but I love Ben."
Leslie Knope," He comes first, and if you're going to act like an ass, I can't talk to you, ever."
Dave Sanderson," Okay, that's fair."
Dave Sanderson,I'm sorry.
Dave Sanderson," That was dumb, all that stuff I did."
Dave Sanderson," You just you make me crazy, and I guess I'm just surprised that you know, that's the guy you fell in love with."
Dave Sanderson," He's very well, he's shrimpy, and he's small."
Leslie Knope," Shrimpy or not He's smart, and he's cute, and he's kind, and he's funny, and he's got a great face and nice hair, and he's"
Dave Sanderson,"Okay, I get it."
Dave Sanderson, I surrender.
Dave Sanderson,I just want to know that you're happy and you're protected.
Leslie Knope, I'm very happy.
Leslie Knope, And he's not shrimpy.
Leslie Knope," A few weeks ago, a guy called me a bitch in a bowling alley, and he punched him in the face."
Dave Sanderson," Oh, good man."
Dave Sanderson," I mean him, for doing that, not the guy who called you a bitch."
Dave Sanderson, You tell me where he is.
Dave Sanderson," I'll punch him, too."
Andy Dwyer," All right, guys, here's the deal, we got to completely start over."
Andy Dwyer, I wrote a new song it's called The Promise Of Tomorrow's Wings.
Andy Dwyer," It's brilliant about a billion times better than Catch Your Dreams, which I realize now sucks ass."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, Chuck, go ahead and just delete everything, all right?"
Ron Swanson,"Hold on, Chuck."
Ron Swanson," Just listen to the song one more time, and then make a decision."
Andy Dwyer,Where's that saxophone coming from?
Ron Swanson, I don't know.
Ron Swanson, I don't know the first thing about music.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, is that a new mix? It sounds way better."
Ron Swanson, See? You just needed to clear your head.
Jerry Gergich," Hey, you guys, who is this? This looks just like Ow, that was loud."
Ben Wyatt," I am telling you that Leslie, in the long run, is so much better for this police department than Bobby Newport is."
Extra,"Gun! No, no, no, no!"
Ben Wyatt,"It's just a, it's paper."
Ben Wyatt," It's, I was reaching for paper."
Chief Trumple," It's all right, boys."
Ben Wyatt, Leslie has a plan to raise cops' pensions and increase benefits without cutting back on hours.
Ben Wyatt," Newport's just gonna keep on buying you guys a couple new cars or some new uniforms, as always."
Ben Wyatt, That guy's all about short-term solutions.
Ben Wyatt," Pretty sweet sauce in there, eh, Ace?"
Chief Trumple,What's wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Leslie Knope," Trumple gave me the endorsement, which is great, but really, the only endorsement that matters is Ben's, and I locked that sucker up a long time ago."
Leslie Knope," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm about endorse ten beers into my mouth, 'cause this has been an incredibly stressful evening."
Andy Dwyer," Nice work, guys."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, a little tradition after Mouse Rat records, someone buys me booze, who's it gonna be?"
Tom Haverford,"All right, look, I know I messed up, but there's something I got to say to you."
Tom Haverford," No playbook, no gimmicks, just me, Tom, talking to you as a person."
Ann Perkins," Okay, I would like that."

Ann Perkins,Morning.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, can you approve this new design for the campaign poster?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you beautiful, rulebreaking moth."
Leslie Knope,You know we can't talk about my campaign in here.
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,"It's a ""yes"" or ""no"" question."
Leslie Knope,"When you're running for office, there are, like, a million rules of what you can and cannot do."
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"And because I work for the government, I am not allowed to do anything campaign related inside a government building."
Andy Dwyer,"Boss, I need your Herbie Hancock on this."
Leslie Knope,Outside.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a pain in the ass.
Leslie Knope,But it's great exercise But it's a pain in the ass.
Ben Wyatt,So Perd Hapley wants to do Thursday now.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
April Ludgate,Did you finish the maintenance report?
Leslie Knope,"I did not finish it, but I will finish it."
Leslie Knope,"So wait, what was your question again?"
Ben Wyatt,The slogan?
April Ludgate,"Okay, can I just come out there, so we can talk about everything?"
Leslie Knope,"No, April, I need to keep my work separate, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Just think of it like a fun game.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign is outside.
Leslie Knope,Parks is inside.
Leslie Knope,Campaign's outside.
April Ludgate,"Ooh, you know what would make it more fun?"
Leslie Knope,What?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, this."
Leslie Knope,April.
Ron Swanson,"It's time, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,You have to take a leave of absence from the department.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, that is ridiculous."
Ron Swanson,We've talked about this.
Leslie Knope,"No, you've talked about it, and I've ignored it, because it is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"Need I remind you that even if I win the election, I can still work at the Parks department."
Leslie Knope,City council is a parttime job.
Ron Swanson,But campaigning is a fulltime job.
Ron Swanson,Right now you're working and 50 hours a week on the campaign.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have time to spare."
Leslie Knope,"I'm also volunteering at ""Wheels For Meals On Wheels."
Leslie Knope,""" We repair vans for ""Meals On Wheels."""
Ron Swanson,You're a month behind on everything.
Ron Swanson,You forgot to file the weekly Parks Maintenance report.
Ron Swanson,"You do it every week, and you forgot."
Ron Swanson,Things are falling through the cracks.
Ron Swanson,I'm pretty sure you've worn that sweater four days in a row.
Leslie Knope,Or I own four identical versions of the same sweater.
Ron Swanson,"No, you don't, there's an old lollipop that's been stuck to the back since Tuesday."
Leslie Knope,"That's the style now, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""lollipopping."""
Leslie Knope,All the kids are doing it.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to take a sabbatical."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"I accept your apology, I will not take a sabbatical, as we agreed, and we will never discuss this again."
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ann."
Tom Haverford,You can't open this gift.
Tom Haverford,It's for the most beautiful girl in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"Hold up, hold up, hold up."
Tom Haverford,"Hold up, hold up, wait."
Tom Haverford,That's you.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, and look, I got one too."
Tom Haverford,Matching His and Hers.
Ann Perkins,"So I'm ""Tommy's girl,"" and you're just ""Tom""?"
Ann Perkins,"Why not ""Ann's man""?"
Tom Haverford,"Nobody owns me, cupcake, not even you."
Ann Perkins,"You can either burn these hats in a fire, or you can use a blowtorch."
Tom Haverford,How about this option?
Tom Haverford,We put the hats on 
Ann Perkins,Don't say it.
Tom Haverford,We take everything else off.
Tom Haverford,These Kangol hats are exactly like the one Samuel L.
Tom Haverford,Jackson wore to the Latin Grammys.
Tom Haverford,How could she not like them?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,It's like somehow everything I do with her is wrong.
April Ludgate,"Dude, seriously, leave me out of this."
April Ludgate,"I kind of set up Tom and Ann, and now they won't stop asking me for advice, which is a really bad move on their part, because I really don't care what happens to them Or anyone."
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, bud."
Andy Dwyer,I missed you.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you so much.
Andy Dwyer,I hope he wasn't a handful.
Chris Traeger,Not in the slightest.
Chris Traeger,"As the Germans would say, ""er ist ein wunder hund."
Chris Traeger,"""  He is a wonder dog."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Chris Traeger,"The dog training course I took was conducted entirely in German, and so now I'm fluent in German Words relating to dogs."
Chris Traeger,"April and Andy went away for the night, and I looked after Champion here."
Chris Traeger,He's a mutt.
Chris Traeger,"Half amazing, half terrific."
Chris Traeger,Ich bin ein three legged dog.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I took him to PetSmart."
Chris Traeger,"I got him various toys, got him shots, got him groomed, and gave him plenty of exercise."
Chris Traeger,He's healthier than ever.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, did his leg grow back?"
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, no, no."
Andy Dwyer,That's okay.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, if I may"
Andy Dwyer, Yes.
Chris Traeger,Dogs tend to take on the personalities  of their owners 
Andy Dwyer, Mmhmm.
Chris Traeger,"So if you were to sit on your couch all day watching cartoons and eating nothing but Cheetos, that's what he would want to do too."
Andy Dwyer,Who wouldn't?
Andy Dwyer,"That sounds like an amazing day, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, thanks."
Chris Traeger,"Bye, Champion."
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, take that shirt off."
Tom Haverford,You look ridiculous.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle gave me this shirt yesterday as a birthday present.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I forgot your birthday.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, it is okay."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, let's face it, it's a tough one to remember."
Jerry Gergich,"My birthday is February 29th, so I only get one real birthday, you know, once every four years."
Jerry Gergich,But it's great because my wife Gayle makes such a big deal out of it.
Jerry Gergich,"We go, we split a huge piece of cotton candy cheesecake from Cakey J's Cheesecake Facility."
Jerry Gergich,"And then, well, we hold hands for a while."
Jerry Gergich,We listen to some Anita Baker.
Jerry Gergich,"She meets up with some friends, and I turn in early."
Leslie Knope,This is unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,Birthdays are important.
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry we forgot yours.
Ron Swanson,I guess it just slipped through the cracks.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I guess it did."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, Happy Birthday to Jerry."
Leslie Knope,You are a kind and wonderful soul.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Also I need you to do some fecal contamination testing  at the reservoir.
Jerry Gergich,Now?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, go get a kit from maintenance, and I need you to check the water for bird dung."
Jerry Gergich,Can I at least grab the gloves?
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, what are you doing standing here?"
Leslie Knope,Our water has poop in it.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Now Jerry is turning 64 this year.
Andy Dwyer,He's only 64?
Leslie Knope,64 divided by 4 is  16.
Andy Dwyer,64
Leslie Knope,So we're gonna throw him a Sweet 16 surprise party.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be very special.
April Ludgate,"The usual, cake and pop?"
Leslie Knope,"No, April, the unusual."
April Ludgate,Fish and pop.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Cake and fish.
Leslie Knope,"No, no fish."
Leslie Knope,Jerry only gets a real birthday every four years.
Leslie Knope,"And four years from now, who knows?"
Leslie Knope,He might be retired Or dead.
Tom Haverford,Let's start a pool.
Tom Haverford,Who wants retied?
Tom Haverford,Who wants dead?
April Ludgate,Dead.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,I got one dead.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,You need to take that?
Leslie Knope,"Mm, no."
Leslie Knope,"The campaign can wait, 'cause this is official Parks business."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, can we use your lake house?"
Donna Meagle,How did you know about that?
Donna Meagle,"My family has a lake house up in the foothills, but we keep it quiet."
Donna Meagle,We're not big on hospitality.
Donna Meagle,The Meagles are a cold people.
Leslie Knope,Can we use your house?
Donna Meagle,I suppose.
Donna Meagle,Bring your own towels.
Ann Perkins,"Wow, Donna."
Ann Perkins,This place is beautiful.
Donna Meagle,"Yes, it is, and it will stay that way."
Donna Meagle,These are the house rules.
Donna Meagle,No dirty shoes in the house.
Donna Meagle,Upstairs is Meagle space only.
Donna Meagle,"And if you listen closely, that is the bubbling of the hot tub."
Donna Meagle,You do not have access to it.
Donna Meagle,"If you follow these rules, we won't have a problem."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,Is that Ginuwine?
Donna Meagle,Mmhmm.
Tom Haverford,Why do you have Ginuwine's platinum record on your wall?
Tom Haverford,Why do you have a photo of you with Ginuwine at some place?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, have I never talked about this before?"
Donna Meagle,Ginuwine's my cousin.
Tom Haverford,Ginuwine?
Tom Haverford,The Ginuwine is your cousin?
Tom Haverford,How do I not know this?
Ann Perkins,Who's Ginuwine?
Tom Haverford,Ginuwine?
Tom Haverford,Ginuwine is Ginuwine.
Tom Haverford,He's Ginuwine.
Ann Perkins,Saying his name over and over again is not going to help me.
Tom Haverford,He's an R&B singer.
Tom Haverford,"Pony, Differences."
Tom Haverford,Do you really not know who Ginuwine is?
Ann Perkins,I know that he's Donna's cousin.
Tom Haverford,"When I'm dating someone, I have a list called my ""oh no nos."
Tom Haverford,""" A woman commits an ""oh no no,"" it can end the relationship."
Tom Haverford,"Not loving '90s R&B music is number three on the ""oh no nos"" list."
Tom Haverford,Girl doesn't even know who Ginuwine is.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, boy."
Chris Traeger,How was the ride?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey, you want me to show you something?"
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Platz.
Chris Traeger,Steh Auf.
Chris Traeger,"See, it's pretty cool, huh?"
Chris Traeger,Would you like me to teach you?
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, whatever."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, anybody can do that."
Andy Dwyer,Toxic.
Andy Dwyer,Merkel.
Andy Dwyer,Merkel.
Andy Dwyer,"What is ""Merkel""?"
Chris Traeger,She's the Chancellor of Germany.
Leslie Knope,Not only more jobs but better jobs.
Leslie Knope,I just did a phone interview while simultaneously decorating this house for Jerry's surprise party.
Leslie Knope,"Totally multitasking, totally on top of all of it."
Leslie Knope,"Crow for dinner tonight, Mr."
Leslie Knope,Swanson?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are locked and loaded."
Leslie Knope,Music is ready.
Leslie Knope,Slideshow is prepped.
Leslie Knope,"April, when does Jerry arrive?"
April Ludgate,How would I know?
Leslie Knope,Who was supposed to invite Jerry?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, someone was supposed to invite Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"It's his surp Crap, it was me."
Leslie Knope,I forgot to invite Jerry.
Ron Swanson,You need to take a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,I'm not taking a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,Is this because I forgot to invite Jerry  to his own birthday party?
Ron Swanson,It did seem like an oversight.
Leslie Knope,"I have a prediction, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"By the end of the night, you are going to take a bite of Jerry's cake, which incidentally, we need to pick up on the way home, and you are gonna say, ""sabbatical, schmabbatical."
Leslie Knope,Leslie can do it all.
Leslie Knope,"She's the best, and I'm stupid."
Ron Swanson,""" That does sound like me."
Tom Haverford,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Here's a fun game.
Tom Haverford,Let's talk minimum acceptable thread count for sheets.
Ann Perkins,"Ooh, that does sound fun."
Tom Haverford,Stop me when I hit it.
Tom Haverford,1000
Tom Haverford,800
Tom Haverford,700
Tom Haverford,600
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I'm at 600."
Tom Haverford,Are you really not stopping me?
Ann Perkins,I have those cotton tshirt sheets.
Tom Haverford,Huh?
Tom Haverford,It's always the most beautiful ladies who hurt you the worst.
Tom Haverford,She's never seen a single Paul Walker movie?
Tom Haverford,"That's a huge ""oh no no."""
Tom Haverford,"She also ""doesn't care"" about Bluray?"
April Ludgate,She's a monster.
Tom Haverford,"April, this is serious."
Tom Haverford,I might have to break up with Ann.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, well, then break up with her."
Tom Haverford,But she's my dream girl.
April Ludgate,Then don't break up with her.
Tom Haverford,Except she hates everything I like.
Tom Haverford,I own more pairs of Uggs than she does.
April Ludgate,"I was getting kind of sick of listening to Tom and Ann talk about their relationship, but then I remembered that alcohol existed."
April Ludgate,"Thank you, alcohol."
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Where the hell could he be?
Ron Swanson,Maybe someone else had a surprise party and actually remembered to invite him.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry.
Leslie Knope,Jerry?
Leslie Knope,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why did you call us in here?"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, because I thought you were Gayle."
Jerry Gergich,What are you doing in my bathroom?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, Leslie, what are we doing in Jerry's bathroom?"
Leslie Knope,"There is a Parks emergency that only you can help us solve, so we need you to get out of the tub."
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, jeez I gotta get dressed."
Leslie Knope,"No, there's no time."
Ron Swanson,"There's time, Jerry."
Ron Swanson,Get dressed.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, what is the big emergency?"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, did we lose more seniors in the woods?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's a sinkhole, right?"
Leslie Knope,Crap on a catapult.
Leslie Knope,They screwed up my campaign signs.
Leslie Knope,Now I gotta deal with this.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, but what about the sinkhole?"
Ron Swanson,"Don't worry, Leslie will deal with this and the sinkhole."
Ron Swanson,"Right, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"I will, Ron."
Leslie Knope,And I shall do it with aplomb.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with Tom?
April Ludgate,Don't know.
Ann Perkins,It's like I'm dating some idiotic game show host.
Ann Perkins,He is driving me crazy with these stupid questions.
April Ludgate,"Well, soon it won't matter."
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,What did he tell you?
April Ludgate,Nothing.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, is he gonna break up with me?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,I'm
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"That's not how this ends, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I break up with him.
April Ludgate,I think I will celebrate with a drink.
Andy Dwyer,Quit pulling.
Andy Dwyer,"Fine, I'll let you off the leash."
Chris Traeger,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"What the [Bleep], dude?"
Andy Dwyer,Where did you come from?
Chris Traeger,I think that Champion should stay on his leash.
Chris Traeger,There's unfamiliar terrain and strange smells.
Andy Dwyer,"No, leashes are just for dogs that bite people."
Chris Traeger,That's not true.
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, Champion's my dog, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,He's not going anywhere.
Andy Dwyer,Sometimes you just have to let a dog be a dog.
Andy Dwyer,He'll be all right.
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,He'll come back.
Leslie Knope,"So as you can imagine, we would never have ordered a sign with all this complicated nonsense because, you know, we're not insane."
Extra,See right here on the order form?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I can read the sign.
Leslie Knope,It does.
Extra,""".com/imagescmyk/""  well, but this isn't what  ""page/carnpaignlqty100123"""
Leslie Knope, You don't need to read the whole thing.
Extra,"""9u/09230023"""
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Extra,"""099twposter"" "
Leslie Knope, it does say that.
Extra,""".jpeg."
Leslie Knope,""" Jpeg."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Walter, it does say that."
Leslie Knope,"You're right, but using basic logic and human intelligence, one can surmise that this is a link to an image."
Leslie Knope,This isn't what we wanted printed on the signs.
Extra,Whatever's on the order form I print.
Extra,"In this case, it was a long string of letters and numbers."
Leslie Knope,Can I just show you something here?
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Extra,That's highly against protocol.
Leslie Knope,"Well, here, look."
Extra,That's a good sign.
Extra,You should've used that.
Ann Perkins,You told April you were breaking up with me?
Tom Haverford,"Ann, we consistently disagree on ""who wore it best."""
Tom Haverford,You still use an iPad one.
Tom Haverford,You read books all the time.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, how about my ""oh no nos"" for you?"
Ann Perkins,"You make me see terrible movies, and then you talk through them."
Ann Perkins,"""You put 20 inch rims on your volkswagen golf, and you insist on being introduced as ""the brown Gosling."
Tom Haverford,""" Everything you just said makes me like me more."
April Ludgate,"I can't take it any more, okay?"
April Ludgate,I'm breaking you up.
April Ludgate,You guys are done.
Ann Perkins,Fine with me.
Tom Haverford,"Fine, fine."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, April."
April Ludgate,I'm drunk.
April Ludgate,"You made me drunk, you made me drunk, and you "
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,Give it a rest.
April Ludgate,I need it.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
April Ludgate,Fine.
Tom Haverford,Let's get you to bed.
April Ludgate,"You know, why are you guys even fighting anyway?"
April Ludgate,It's so stupid.
April Ludgate,"""I hate Ann because of this stupid reason."""
April Ludgate,"""And I hate Tom for this stupid reason."""
April Ludgate,Who cares?
Ron Swanson,You want some help?
Leslie Knope,"No, I got it."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we did everything, Ron."
Leslie Knope,We got new signs.
Leslie Knope,We put them in people's yards.
Leslie Knope,We got Jerry for the surprise sinkhole emergency.
Leslie Knope,"And, uh, we briefly ran out of gas, and then we walked to the gas station."
Leslie Knope,"We got more gas, and now we're all good."
Ron Swanson,"Yep, you truly are attempting to do it all."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,We didn't get to the drug store for my liver medication.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you should've thought about that before we dragged you out of the bath, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, wait a second."
Jerry Gergich,This is clearly not a sinkhole problem.
Jerry Gergich,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, as soon as we open this door, everything will become clear."
Leslie Knope,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, what the [Bleep]?"
Ben Wyatt,Surprise.
Leslie Knope,Where the hell is everybody?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it got so late."
Ben Wyatt,We just weren't sure you were still coming.
Ben Wyatt,Everybody's either in bed or out looking for Champion.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,Champion ran away.
Leslie Knope,Wake everybody up.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"No, I am not gonna let this fall apart."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna throw Jerry an amazing Sweet 16 surprise party no matter how agonizing it is for all of us.
Ben Wyatt,That's the spirit.
Andy Dwyer,Champion.
Chris Traeger,Champion!
Chris Traeger,"Champion, come here, boy."
Chris Traeger,"I have an organic, gluten free soy bone for you."
Andy Dwyer,Champion!
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, there's something I have to tell you."
Andy Dwyer,I ate one of your soy bones.
Chris Traeger,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it was really good."
Andy Dwyer,"I was gonna give it to Champion, but it just it looked so yummy."
Andy Dwyer,"The point is, I'm a terrible dog owner."
Andy Dwyer,"And I think, if we find Champion, you should keep him."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, if it wasn't for you and April, Champion would still be back at the pound."
Chris Traeger,You gave him a home.
Chris Traeger,That's amazing.
Chris Traeger,And he's your dog.
Chris Traeger,"If you just call out his name, he will come to you."
Andy Dwyer,"What no, he won't 'cause I've been trying it, and it didn't work."
Chris Traeger,I think he likes your music.
Chris Traeger,Why don't you sing to him?
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,I don't have my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,I usually  
Chris Traeger,Come on
Andy Dwyer,"I feel naked without it, okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Champion, you're lost and soon you'll be found I rescued you from the pound, something somethingoh manon the ground get on out of here Champion!"
Andy Dwyer,"Champion, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, buddy, you came back."
Andy Dwyer,You came back to my voice.
Chris Traeger,Dog whistle.
Ann Perkins,"April, wake up."
Tom Haverford, Jerry's here.
Ann Perkins, April.
Tom Haverford,April.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
April Ludgate, Why is your arm around her? I broke you up.
Tom Haverford," Well, we got back together again 'cause of what you said."
April Ludgate, What do you mean? I didn't say anything.
Ann Perkins," Yeah, when we were carrying you to bed, you correctly pointed out that we were arguing about stuff that was stupid, and so we talked it out."
Ann Perkins," And I apologized, and he apologized."
Ann Perkins, And now everything's great.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate, I'm drunk.
April Ludgate," Don't listen to me, no."
Ann Perkins,See you out there.
April Ludgate,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, thanks, guys."
Jerry Gergich," This is really, this is really great."
Leslie Knope," Okay, I want everyone to go around and tell their favorite Jerry story."
Leslie Knope, A positive one.
Leslie Knope, Who's first?
Tom Haverford," Jerry, today is your birthday, but it's about much more than that."
Tom Haverford, It's also about Ann and I getting back together and being the hottest couple in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford, I'd also like to announce our official relationship mash-up name.
Tom Haverford," It's ""Tan."""
Tom Haverford,To Tan.
Ann Perkins, I would like to announce that the name Tan is officially over.
Ann Perkins, To the end of Tan.
Tom Haverford,Haverkins it is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna?"
Donna Meagle,"I would like to address the fact that rule number seven says, ""no pets,"" and yet there is a three legged animal in my living room."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Ron Swanson, Jerry's work is often adequate.
Chris Traeger, I'll go.
Chris Traeger," Jerry has a wife and three beautiful daughters, a full life, and that's amazing."
Chris Traeger," April and Andy have Champion, and that's amazing."
Chris Traeger, I have a stepbrother who lives in London and 2.8% body fat.
Jerry Gergich, Guys guys What do I do?
Tom Haverford," I mean, she's asleep."
Tom Haverford, You probably should just sit there and not move.
Ben Wyatt, She's really tired.
Ben Wyatt, Just a few hours.
Jerry Gergich, Few hours?
Ron Swanson, Is this all the eggs we have?
Donna Meagle, Yes.
Donna Meagle, What are you making? 
Ron Swanson,Eggs.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,"Surprise! Oh, God."
Leslie Knope," What happened? Well, you slept with Jerry last night."
Leslie Knope," No, I was planning Jerry's morning surprise party."
Leslie Knope, Morning surprise parties are always the best.
Leslie Knope,Let's get going.
Ron Swanson,I made some coffee.
Ron Swanson, Let's go for a walk.
Ron Swanson, I now officially insist that you take a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope,"No, no."
Ron Swanson,Let me finish.
Ron Swanson," I used to work in a sheet metal factory, but then a job came along at the tannery."
Ron Swanson," The hours were better, and I would get paid."
Ron Swanson," Also I'd have the chance to work with leather both before and after it was on the cow, which had always been a dream of mine."
Ron Swanson," I didn't want to give up my sheet metal job, so I tried to do both jobs and finish middle school."
Leslie Knope, How old were you?
Ron Swanson,11
Ron Swanson,"The point is, I was so tired, I tried to puncture an eight-gauge aluminum foil with a leather awl."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ron Swanson,I  learned a lesson.
Ron Swanson, Never halfass two things.
Ron Swanson, Wholeass one thing.
Ron Swanson, So if you want to win that seat
Leslie Knope, Which I do.
Ron Swanson, Then commit yourself 100%.
Ron Swanson, Take a sabbatical.
Leslie Knope, I will cut back to 10 hours a week.
Ron Swanson, Deal.
Leslie Knope,15
Ron Swanson,10
Leslie Knope, Deal.
April Ludgate," Ugh, I can't believe I got them back together."
April Ludgate, Now they're always gonna want to come talk to me about stuff.
Andy Dwyer," Eh, that's a good thing, babe."
Andy Dwyer, They want to talk to you because you're important to them.
April Ludgate," Yes, but I hate them."
Andy Dwyer," I know you do, sweetheart."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, hey, uh, by the way, I think that Chris is lonely, so I told him he could borrow Champion whenever."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, he's kissing me."
Andy Dwyer,Aww.
Leslie Knope," Jerry, I wanted to say I'm sorry that I screwed up your birthday party."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that's okay."
Leslie Knope,But we all pitched in.
Leslie Knope, And we are sending you and Gayle to a B&B in your favorite place in the world.
Jerry Gergich, Muncie?
Leslie Knope,"Amazingly, yes."
Leslie Knope," Muncie, Indiana."
Jerry Gergich," Thank you, guys."
Andy Dwyer, It was really expensive.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, campaign."
Ron Swanson,Take it.
Leslie Knope, Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer," If the Bread and Breakfast, you sleep there and you get breakfast."
Leslie Knope,This is Leslie.

Extra,"This is ""The Final Word with Perd."""
Extra,"With your host, Perderick L."
Extra,Hapley.
Perd Hapley,Issue number one is the first issue we're going to talk about.
Perd Hapley,Is Bobby Newport's campaign for city council in trouble?
Perd Hapley,"When I say your names, I want you to respond."
Perd Hapley,Dylan.
Extra,"Well, Newport's poll numbers have been plummeting."
Extra,"They just fired his campaign manager, and where's Bobby?"
Extra,He's on vacation in Spain.
Extra,"He's not on vacation, he's in hiding."
Extra,"Every time the guy speaks, he puts his foot in his mouth."
Perd Hapley,That's a hilarious image.
Perd Hapley,A foot in a mouth.
Extra,It's a common expression.
Perd Hapley,Okay.
Perd Hapley,"According to the newest polls, Leslie knope is now in second place."
Perd Hapley,She's just 15 points back.
Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, yeah!"
Perd Hapley,How did she close the gap?
Extra,"You have to give a lot of credit to her campaign manager, Ben Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,"So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass."
Leslie Knope,Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.
Leslie Knope,Every move he's made has worked.
Leslie Knope,"He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird."
Ben Wyatt,What did you just say?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,Keep up the good work.
Leslie Knope,You're doing great.
Ben Wyatt,"Senior citizens are basically the only people who vote in local elections, so if you want to win, you gotta get the gray vote."
Leslie Knope,"And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones."
Leslie Knope,He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.
Leslie Knope,He's like The Godfather but old.
Ben Wyatt,He's like The Grandfather.
Ben Wyatt,The Grand Godfather.
Leslie Knope,"The ""grond"" father, he's like It doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"He's important, and he's old."
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Jones, such a pleasure to meet you."
Leslie Knope,Please don't get up.
Ned Jones,Don't worry.
Ned Jones,I can't.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ned Jones,Just joking.
Ned Jones,I can get up.
Ned Jones,But it's difficult.
Ned Jones,"But I can do it, but it is hard."
Ned Jones,"Look, I don't have a lot of time."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,Is it cancer?
Ned Jones,"No, I don't have a lot of time before my swim aerobics."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ned Jones,Why are you better for seniors than Bobby Newport?
Leslie Knope,Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.
Leslie Knope,"Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind ""everything hurts"" and ""I'm dying."""
Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me.
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,What the hell are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Upsidedown situps.
Chris Traeger,"Great exercise, and it literally lets me see the world from a different perspective."
Ron Swanson,Isn't there a men's gymnasium where you could do that?
Chris Traeger,"The world's my gymnasium, Ron."
Chris Traeger,But I will stop if it makes you uncomfortable.
Chris Traeger,Could you hold me while I dismount?
Chris Traeger,Thanks so much.
Ron Swanson,You bet.
Chris Traeger,Question for you.
Chris Traeger,"In a town of this size, the Parks department traditionally has ten employees."
Chris Traeger,You have only seven.
Chris Traeger,Why is that?
Ron Swanson,I work hard to make sure my department is as small and ineffective as possible.
Chris Traeger,The department is so small because Leslie Knope singlehandedly does the work of four people.
Chris Traeger,And she's already scaled back her time.
Chris Traeger,"If she wins, she'll be dividing her time between Parks and City Council."
Chris Traeger,I'm going to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack.
Ron Swanson,No!
Ron Swanson,"Chris, that's unnecessary."
Ron Swanson,The department is doing fine without Leslie.
Chris Traeger,Then prove it.
Chris Traeger,Complete one major project.
Ron Swanson,"Either we complete a government project which is abhorrent to me, or we bring a new person into the department, which repulses me to my core."
Ron Swanson,Reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my sixth birthday.
Ron Swanson,"I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them."
Ron Swanson,And they were delicious.
Ben Wyatt,"Essentially, we're going to put a ramp on every building in town."
Leslie Knope,"Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game."
Ned Jones,Damn straight.
Ned Jones,This is very impressive.
Ned Jones,"You know, you remind me of my brother."
Ned Jones,"You have the same name, Leslie."
Ned Jones,He lost a third of his body in a motorcycle accident.
Ned Jones,The middle third.
Ned Jones,But they sutured the hell out of him.
Ned Jones,He's he's fine now.
Ned Jones,"Much shorter, but a goodlooking, young, flat man."
Ned Jones,"What have you heard about Newport's new campaign manager, Jennifer Barkley?"
Leslie Knope,"Uh, who?"
Ned Jones,She wants to have a meeting with me at 5:00.
Ned Jones,I told her sorry.
Ned Jones,I don't talk politics after dinner.
Leslie Knope,Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, she worked with James Carville?"
Ben Wyatt,She ran two Republican congressional campaigns and a Senate race.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and check out this picture."
Leslie Knope,She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.
Leslie Knope,That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.
Leslie Knope,Why are you smiling?
Leslie Knope,Why is this terrifying information making you smile?
Ben Wyatt,Newport's scared.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he must've shelled out a fortune to hire her."
Leslie Knope,So what do we do next?
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to set up a meeting.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we can size her up, but more importantly, it'll humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you."
Ben Wyatt,And we'll do it at JJ's Diner.
Ben Wyatt,Home field advantage.
Leslie Knope,"As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann Perkins."
Ann Perkins,This is the first time you've said my entire name correctly.
Ron Swanson,Nonsense.
Ron Swanson,We are close friends.
Ron Swanson,I have good news for you.
Ron Swanson,I'm making the water fountain hygiene upgrade our number one priority.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, great."
Ann Perkins,"For some reason, when people in Pawnee use the water fountain, they put their mouths completely over the spouts."
Ann Perkins,"It's like this weird, disgusting, local quirk."
Ann Perkins,"Kiss one water fountain drinker, you're kissing everyone in Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,Including him.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to complete this project by tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ron Swanson,Set up shop in our office.
Ron Swanson,"In fact, take Leslie's desk."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I will."
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Ann Perkins,Great.
April Ludgate,Do you want the door open or shut?
Ann Perkins,"Ah, open's fine."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Marta."
Leslie Knope,"We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone."
Extra,You mean Ms.
Extra,Barkley.
Extra,She's already here.
Extra,Last booth.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope.
Jennifer Barkley,Hi.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm Jen Barkley.
Jennifer Barkley,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Jennifer Barkley,Grab a seat.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry about all these papers.
Jennifer Barkley,I had them shipped in.
Jennifer Barkley,I'm a news junkie.
Ben Wyatt,Is this in Arabic?
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, I've been reading up on you two."
Jennifer Barkley,"Ben, it's a great job on this campaign."
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Jennifer Barkley,"And Leslie, your Parks work, it's no joke."
Jennifer Barkley,This is federal government caliber.
Ben Wyatt,"Not to sound rude, but what are you doing here?"
Ben Wyatt,This campaign seems beneath you.
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's daddy called me out of the blue.
Jennifer Barkley,"I'd never heard of Bobby Newport before, but it became clear in two seconds this guy is a moron."
Jennifer Barkley,"So I was, like, ""sorry, Nick."""
Jennifer Barkley,Your son is a moron.
Jennifer Barkley,There's no way.
Jennifer Barkley,""" Then he offered me a crazy amount of money."
Jennifer Barkley,I shouldn't even tell you how much.
Jennifer Barkley,But I will.
Jennifer Barkley,"$250,000.00 "
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,For six weeks of work?
Jennifer Barkley,I know.
Jennifer Barkley,"Plus frankly, I needed a break from Washington."
Leslie Knope,Do you know Joe Biden?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, mmhmm."
Leslie Knope,He's on my celebrity sex list.
Leslie Knope,"Well, he is my celebrity sex list."
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, trust me."
Jennifer Barkley,You can do better than Joe.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think I can.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, man."
Jennifer Barkley,I knew I shouldn't have met you guys.
Jennifer Barkley,Now I kind of hope you win.
Leslie Knope,She's just doing this for the money.
Leslie Knope,She doesn't even like her own client.
Leslie Knope,This could be the best case scenario for us.
Ben Wyatt,Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.
Perd Hapley,Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America."
Jennifer Barkley,"She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,What?
Perd Hapley,"Wow, strong words from a powerful lady."
Jennifer Barkley,So I guess we both agree.
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is wrong for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario.
Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario!
Extra,"I'm Leslie Knope and when I grow up, I want to be a unicorn princess or a city councilor."
Extra,Wrong.
Extra,"Not in my town, kid."
Extra,City council's a real job for a real adult.
Ben Wyatt,It's playing every hour on every channel.
Leslie Knope,It's official.
Leslie Knope,I hate Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,"When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't let Barkley knock us off message."
Ben Wyatt,"We are going there to get Ned Jones' endorsement,  and that's huge."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,"And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king."
Ben Wyatt,Do you wish I were taller or what's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,You're perfect.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, everyone."
Ann Perkins,So the Health department is working on a poster campaign to warn people about diseases.
Ann Perkins,Now we are going to build a better water fountain for the parks.
Ann Perkins,Andy is our official waterfountain tester.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's give this sucker a testdrive."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that to."
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that's good."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, any ideas?"
Ann Perkins,Jerry?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I was thinking that we could put this cage thing around it."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,That could work.
Ann Perkins,Andy?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, still good."
Ann Perkins,Tom?
Tom Haverford,Full disclosure.
Tom Haverford,Ann and I are romantically intertwined.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,So let's not be surprised if she picks my idea.
Ann Perkins,"Would you just go, dummy?"
Tom Haverford,What's the best kind of water fountain?
Tom Haverford,How about no water fountain?
Tom Haverford,This is the Voss Water Butler by Tumi.
Tom Haverford,And only $600 a bag.
Ann Perkins,"April, what's your idea?"
April Ludgate,To go in that room and finish this book.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, really?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Is it good?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,"You're going to stay here, and you're going to help."
Ann Perkins,Donna?
Donna Meagle,Do I look like I drink water?
Leslie Knope,Yoohoo.
Leslie Knope,I'm over here.
Leslie Knope,Just about to start my presentation.
Leslie Knope,"I uhoh, stairs."
Leslie Knope,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,How do I get from here to there?
Leslie Knope,I'm not a professional mountain climber.
Leslie Knope,"It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game."
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,Ramps are an idiot's game.
Extra,This is nothing more than a worse version of Bobby Newport's plan.
Leslie Knope,What plan?
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.
Jennifer Barkley,Was somebody just talking about Bobby Newport's plan?
Jennifer Barkley,Because Ned Jones and I would love to share it with you.
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on out here, Ned."
Ned Jones,Ned Jones is here.
Ned Jones,Say hello to Ned Jones.
Ned Jones,Make way for Ned Jones.
Donna Meagle,Why don't we just turn up the pressure?
Donna Meagle,That way you don't have to put your mouth so close.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go."
April Ludgate,"Ah, stop!"
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm sorry."
Ann Perkins,That'll teach you to pay attention.
April Ludgate,I have an idea.
April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking, ""what if we did ""something like this?"
Ann Perkins,""" Oh, my dude, what the hell?"
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport's plan is called ""Rise Up!"
Jennifer Barkley,Pawnee.
Jennifer Barkley,""" He is going to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town."
Jennifer Barkley,Wow.
Jennifer Barkley,"Now you could use a ramp, but that seems like a lot of work."
Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport thinks that the stairs should do the work for you, don't you agree?"
Jennifer Barkley,Give him a hand.
Ned Jones,"As President of Seniors United, I endorse Bobby Newport."
Chris Traeger,I've started meeting with people to fill in for Leslie.
Chris Traeger,I have found five candidates I'd like to hire and two I'd like to be lifelong friends with.
Ron Swanson,"Well, you will not be hiring anyone because my department is just finishing up a major project."
Andy Dwyer,Incoming!
Andy Dwyer,Got you!
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, don't!"
Chris Traeger,Excuse me.
Tom Haverford,"Help, everything I'm wearing is suede!"
Tom Haverford,"Everything I'm wearing is suede, everything I'm wearing is suede!"
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, everybody."
Ron Swanson,Attention!
Chris Traeger,I think you'll agree that this department could use a little leadership.
Andy Dwyer,Kamikaze!
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"""Stumbling for the first time in months, ""the Knope campaign seems to be rolling down ""a ramp to nowhere."
Leslie Knope,""" We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country."
Leslie Knope,He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I wish I was better at this."
Ben Wyatt,Then you could be making out with some floozy in Majorca.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe we take the fight to her?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea."
Leslie Knope,That sounds good.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just do that."
Ben Wyatt,"I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there."
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,Chris wants you in his office for the final round of interviews.
April Ludgate,And sorry we goofed around so much.
Ron Swanson,"Normally, I'd be very proud of you for what you did."
Ron Swanson,This is a rare example where wasting a full day of work is a bad thing.
April Ludgate,"Is there really going to be a weird, new person in the office?"
Ron Swanson,I think so.
Ron Swanson,"We may be in for a good, old fashioned shakeup."
Leslie Knope,Jennifer Barkley.
Leslie Knope,"You twofaced, carpetbagging"
Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,Good to see you.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, nice to see you, too."
Leslie Knope,"You are a twofaced, carpet"
Jennifer Barkley,You want anything?
Jennifer Barkley,Anything?
Jennifer Barkley,It's on me.
Jennifer Barkley,Everything in this town is so cheap.
Leslie Knope,"I would never accept anything from a twofaced, carpetbagging "
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Let me get my insults out.
Leslie Knope,I've been practicing it the whole way over here.
Jennifer Barkley,I sense that you're angry.
Jennifer Barkley,Tell me why.
Leslie Knope,"Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work."
Leslie Knope,"Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts."
Leslie Knope,My idea is better.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, I don't doubt it."
Jennifer Barkley,The fact is I don't care.
Jennifer Barkley,"Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan I don't actually care about any of this."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just trying to win.
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, it's not personal."
Jennifer Barkley,I like you.
Jennifer Barkley,But my job is to beat you.
Jennifer Barkley,So have a seat.
Jennifer Barkley,I'll get you some of those waffles you love.
Leslie Knope,How do you know that
Jennifer Barkley,It's my job to know.
Leslie Knope,"God, you're good."
Jennifer Barkley,I know.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys."
Chris Traeger,What's so imporant?
Ann Perkins,"Well, after yesterday's hands on brainstorming session"
Chris Traeger,Water balloon fight.
Ann Perkins,Fair enough.
Ann Perkins,We think we came up with a fountain idea that really works.
Ann Perkins,Presenting the amazing spoutless fountain.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,"We just removed the splash guard because if it's not there, you can't put your mouth on it."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll I'll try it."
Andy Dwyer,I did it.
April Ludgate,"Good job, babe."
Chris Traeger,"Simple, elegant, and costeffective."
Chris Traeger,"If your team keeps this up, I think we can hold off on filling the Leslie void."
Donna Meagle,I think Ben's already filling the Leslie void.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Chris Traeger,I'll give it up for that.
Jennifer Barkley,So what's Ben's next move for you?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that."
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, let me guess."
Jennifer Barkley,"Um, you're going to attack me."
Jennifer Barkley,"You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours."
Leslie Knope,"It's ""Perd,"" first of all, and no."
Leslie Knope,Maybe.
Leslie Knope,No.
Jennifer Barkley,That's not a terrible idea.
Jennifer Barkley,"No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea"
Leslie Knope,Which you did.
Jennifer Barkley,"Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goodygoody nerd."
Jennifer Barkley,Because you know what people don't care about?
Jennifer Barkley,They don't care about whose idea was first.
Jennifer Barkley,They care about whose idea was best.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't."
Jennifer Barkley,"Mmhmm, okay."
Leslie Knope,What would you do instead?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Jennifer Barkley,"Ah, what the hell."
Jennifer Barkley,"If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself."
Jennifer Barkley,You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.
Jennifer Barkley,"No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, ""you can never spend too much on seniors."""
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Jennifer Barkley,You need to beat our idea.
Jennifer Barkley,Come up with something better.
Jennifer Barkley,I don't know.
Jennifer Barkley,Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.
Jennifer Barkley,"All right, that could work."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Extra,Waffles and a cappuccino.
Jennifer Barkley,"Gracias, Marta."
Leslie Knope,JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, it does now."
Jennifer Barkley,I bought them one.
Leslie Knope,Course you did.
Ben Wyatt,You talked to Barkley without me?
Leslie Knope,I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.
Leslie Knope,And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager."
Leslie Knope,But what if she's right?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, what if it's a trick?"
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work."
Leslie Knope,"Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it."
Leslie Knope,But she knows that I know that she knows that She's in our heads.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,She's better at this than I am.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?"
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I'd like to talk about your future.
Ann Perkins,Why are we on this bench?
Ann Perkins,This is weird.
Ron Swanson,You did a great job solving that problem today.
Ron Swanson,The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinking
Ann Perkins,I didn't solve that problem.
Ann Perkins,April did.
Ron Swanson,Really?
Ron Swanson, Why did she tell me you did?
Ann Perkins," Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something."
Ann Perkins," If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer."
Ron Swanson, Perhaps you're right.
Ann Perkins, Should I go?
Ron Swanson,"Oh, you're still here?"
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Perd Hapley, Let's begin the show by starting it.
Perd Hapley," Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas."
Leslie Knope," Well, uh They did, they stole our idea."
Leslie Knope, We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.
Jennifer Barkley," Oh, Perd."
Jennifer Barkley, This is politics as usual.
Jennifer Barkley," The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee."
Leslie Knope," Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper."
Jennifer Barkley," There she goes again, Perd."
Perd Hapley, I don't know where she went the first time.
Jennifer Barkley," Bobby Newport cares about better, not cheaper for our seniors."
Perd Hapley, And our flash poll seems to agree.
Perd Hapley, Some 78% of those we surveyed prefer the Newport plan to the Knope plan.
Jennifer Barkley, This is why Ned Jones has endorsed us.
Jennifer Barkley, Let's get back on track.
Jennifer Barkley, I just think our opposition is losing sight of what all this is about.
Leslie Knope," What this is about is Pawnee, and that is what I care about."
Leslie Knope, What Bobby Newport cares about is romping around on some beach in Spain with a floozy.
Jennifer Barkley, Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, maybe you hadn't heard of it."
Leslie Knope," It wasn't in the New York Times or Le Monde, which is what she reads."
Leslie Knope, It was in the Pawnee papers.
Jennifer Barkley, Bobby Newport's personal life is neither here nor there.
Leslie Knope, It's certainly not here.
Leslie Knope," And I think Pawneeans deserve a city councilor who stays in the city, like I do."
Jennifer Barkley," Well, we were going to keep this  a secret until we had everything in writing, but Bobby Newport is trying to convince a major European company to open up a factory in Pawnee."
Jennifer Barkley, And that woman that he is with is an anti landmine advocate.
Jennifer Barkley, I didn't realize that you were pro landmine.
Perd Hapley," I am not here to declare a winner, but Jennifer is the winner."
Jennifer Barkley, Thank you.
Perd Hapley," Now it's time to move onto our next segment, which is a commercial."
Leslie Knope," I am going to get drunk, and then I'm going to order a three-course meal where each course is made of dessert."
Ben Wyatt,She kicked our asses.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, How are we going to beat her?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, she's like a hurricane."
Ben Wyatt, She's everywhere.
Leslie Knope, Literally.
Jennifer Barkley," Hi, guys."
Jennifer Barkley, You really stepped up your game.
Jennifer Barkley, That was really fun.
Jennifer Barkley, You almost got me.
Leslie Knope, I would have if Bobby Newport hadn't gotten those stupid companies to build factories here.
Jennifer Barkley," What are you talking about? Oh, that thing I said on the show? Oh, no."
Jennifer Barkley, That was mostly made-up.
Jennifer Barkley, Don't challenge me on that.
Jennifer Barkley, That will backfire.
Jennifer Barkley," Anyway, enjoy your dinner, guys."
Jennifer Barkley, I already took care of the bill.
Ben Wyatt,"Another round, please?"
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Ron Swanson, Nice job on the water fountain.
April Ludgate,It wasn't me.
Ron Swanson,Don't deny it.
Ron Swanson, I know it wasn't the nurse.
Ron Swanson, I'm asking you to step up.
Ron Swanson," Not replacing Leslie, just picking up some slack."
April Ludgate, I don't want to do things.
April Ludgate," I want to not do things, just like you taught me."
Ron Swanson," And I taught you well, but I don't like watching you wasting your brain."
Ron Swanson, And you're too smart to stay my assistant here forever.
Ron Swanson," I'd rather you start a business or use your hands to farm, but right now, the department needs you."
Ron Swanson, Please.

Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,Oh.

Leslie Knope,"No, those endless scarves that come out of your sleeves like a magician."
Ben Wyatt,Um I think you should just go with something basic No nonsense.
Ben Wyatt,Mr.
Ben Wyatt,"Wood, hello."

Tom Haverford,Do you know who the president or boring club is?
Ben Wyatt,Me?

Leslie Knope,"Hey, why don't we all go get a drink, blow off some steam?"

Leslie Knope,"Ah, screw it."

Andy Dwyer,I would say what I find very cool about Susan B.
Andy Dwyer,"Anthony is How She was born in Adams, Massachusetts, in 1820."

Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Mmm!
Andy Dwyer,"I was hoping for a P plus, but that does not exist."

Linda Lonegan,Right.

Jerry Gergich,It makes sense to me.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,This was such a good idea.
Leslie Knope,Should we get another round?

Tom Haverford,Uh maybe we should all just drink sensible portions of milk.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I love him."
Leslie Knope,"It's just This campaign has turned fun, dorky Ben  into grumpy, stressball Ben."

Linda Lonegan,"My father once told my mother that woman was made from the rib of Adam, and my mom broke his jaw."
Linda Lonegan,My Uncle Lon once tried to

Leslie Knope,Thank you for being on my show.
Buddy Wood,"Leslie, we're here at the Pawnee municipal airport, which I must add is rather decrepit."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad you mentioned it."
Leslie Knope,It is in desperate need of refurbishments.
Leslie Knope,And that is why I'm going to make it a centerpiece  of my platform.
Buddy Wood,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Take, uh Joe Appledemas over there."
Leslie Knope,"Joe, say hi."
Extra,Hello.
Leslie Knope,"Joe has been working here since 1996, and his salary has not been raised a nickel."
Leslie Knope,I am gonna work very hard to change
Buddy Wood,"Okay, this airport seems to me like a metaphor."
Buddy Wood,Are you familiar with the term?
Buddy Wood,"Pawnee's airport is symbolic of the town out of touch, out of date, perhaps, lost, insignificant, and sad."
Buddy Wood,Your thoughts?
Leslie Knope,"Well, granted, we don't have big city amenities, but I think we more than make up for it with friendly faces and handworking hards hardworking hands."
Buddy Wood,If you say so.
Buddy Wood,I say it's sad.
Buddy Wood,Moving on
Andy Dwyer," Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"If they got together, they would make the most beautiful super baby."
Andy Dwyer,It would rule us all.
Andy Dwyer,But what if super baby became too powerful?
April Ludgate,I guess we'll just have to take that chance.
April Ludgate,Chris got dumped by Jerry's daughter.

April Ludgate,"Plus, if they get married, he'll spend all his time with her, and I might never have to talk to him again."
April Ludgate,Hmm.
April Ludgate,"Professor Linda, you have Really nice arms."
Linda Lonegan,Oh?
April Ludgate,Do you work out?
Chris Traeger,I was gonna say the exact same thing.
Chris Traeger,But I didn't want you to think that I was objectifying you with my male gaze.
Chris Traeger,May I see?
Linda Lonegan,"Oh, sure."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my good gracious."
Chris Traeger,You have  extraordinary caput laterale.
Linda Lonegan,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,There's nothing more important than physical health.
Linda Lonegan,I agree.
Ron Swanson,Kendra?
Extra,Yes?
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,I am gonna have that third steak after all.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead and put that order in now, please, and thank you."
Buddy Wood,"Your campaign hit a snag of sorts, with the revelation that you and your boss, Ben Wyatt, were having une affaire de coeur affair of the heart."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I've discussed that many times, and there's really nothing more to say."
Leslie Knope,I would rather talk about the ways to solve problems in this town.
Buddy Wood,Good luck with that.
Buddy Wood,"But getting back to your affair with Ben Wyatt, who's now your campaign manager"
Leslie Knope,"Buddy, frankly, I don't want to discuss that."
Leslie Knope,"But if you'd like, we can talk about ways that I can improve the airport or our many wonderful parks."
Buddy Wood,I don't.
Buddy Wood,I'd like to talk about you and Ben Wyatt.
Ann Perkins,Uhoh.
Ann Perkins,I know that look.
Tom Haverford,She's got the crazy eyes.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, like I said, I don't want to discuss it, Buddy, and, frankly, I don't appreciate your condescending tone."
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope,"I've had a couple drinks, so what the hell?"
Leslie Knope,Ben and I first 
Buddy Wood,"I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, are you inebriated?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Preposterous.
Leslie Knope,Are you inebriated?
Leslie Knope,That was bad timing.
Buddy Wood,"This is a Buddy Wood first an exclusive interview with potential city councilwoman Leslie Knope, who appears to be drunk right now on camera."
Leslie Knope,I am not drunk.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, when you have a jumbo Margarita and some flaming Tequila shots, you can get drunk."
Buddy Wood,"Is it this sad, pathetic town that makes you drink this way?"
Leslie Knope,This interview is over.
Buddy Wood,"Okay, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,Oh This this is not because I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,This is because of the wire.
Buddy Wood,"A fitting end to a bizarre interview and a sad moment in a depressing city with no hope, in the waning moments of the bitter saga that has been a contentious campaign."
Leslie Knope,"C'mon Buddy, you cannot air that tape."
Buddy Wood,Are you kidding?
Buddy Wood,This is as great for me as it is terrible for you.
Buddy Wood,The sheep that watch my show are gonna eat this up like tiramisu.
Buddy Wood,Tiramisu is an Italian dessert often
Leslie Knope,"I know what tiramisu is, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And sheep don't eat it.
Buddy Wood,"Sorry, but Tomorrow morning this gets broadcast around the entire Indianasphere."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you for celebrating the most ultimate triumph of my life.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm very proud of me, and you are too."
Andy Dwyer,"And, Professor, I'm taking your class again next semester."
Andy Dwyer,And I'm gonna lock down that P plus.
Linda Lonegan,It's impossible.
Andy Dwyer,You and the women taught me that nothing is impossible.
Chris Traeger,"Alright, I better be going."
Chris Traeger,I have to get up early.
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Chris Traeger,I'm teaching a morning Zumba class for retirees.
Chris Traeger,"Before I do, Linda, do you enjoy land kayaking?"
Chris Traeger,It's quite fun.
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's more grueling than fun."
Chris Traeger,But I would love to take you.
Linda Lonegan,"I'm really flattered, but I just got out of a relationship, and I think I need a little more time before I jump into anything."
Chris Traeger,Of course.
Chris Traeger,I understand.
Linda Lonegan,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,I appreciate your caution.
Linda Lonegan,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,I hope to see you again.
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, everyone."
Ron Swanson,Anybody want to go to JJ's for some after dinner omelets?
Linda Lonegan,Or how about you and I go back to my place?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"Ben, I am so sorry."
Ben Wyatt,Let's just focus on the problem.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, if we don't stop that interview from airing in the morning, this campaign is dead."
Ben Wyatt,So We have to go to Indianapolis.
Tom Haverford,And do what?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,I guess we'll just set fire to the studio or something.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, that's so sweet I've never had a boyfriend threaten to commit arson for me before."
Donna Meagle,"Ah, it gets old."
Tom Haverford,We still have six hours of rental time on the hot tub limo.
Tom Haverford,We could take that.
Tom Haverford,No one would have to drive all night.
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a good idea.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, it allows for the possibility of high speed skinny dipping."
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,"Ann, I was joking."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, it was a joke."
Ann Perkins,It was funny.
Extra,"Where we going, folks drive around, hit the strip clubs?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to this address in Indianapolis.
Extra,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Extra,"You know, no one ever used this hottub limo for actual transportation."
Extra,"And I can't take this thing on the highway, so it'll take a few extra hours."
Extra,"Hey, is this a seven or a one?"
Donna Meagle,Jerry.
Donna Meagle,Jerry!
Donna Meagle,Maybe you should wrap it up.
Donna Meagle,It's 4:00 in the morning.
Jerry Gergich,Is it really?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh."
Jerry Gergich, Wow.
Jerry Gergich," Well, that flew by, huh? I will just take these down to the post office and, uh, put the, uh Oh, jeez."
Jerry Gergich," Oh, no."
Jerry Gergich," I put the handout flyers in the mailing envelopes, and I was supposed to put these flyers in the envelopes."
Donna Meagle, Oh My God.
Jerry Gergich," Well, you know, it's like I always say."
Jerry Gergich, It ain't government work if you don't have to do it twice.
Jerry Gergich, Here we go!
Donna Meagle,I'll make some coffee.
Buddy Wood," Hey, you're blocking my driveway."
Buddy Wood, Leslie Knope? - What are you doing?
Leslie Knope," Hi, um Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry."
Leslie Knope," We, oh, my God, I can't see."
Leslie Knope, It's so bright out here.
Ben Wyatt,Ohh.
Leslie Knope,"We drove here to ask you, No, to beg you to please destroy that tape."
Buddy Wood," Yeah, I got your 50 messages."
Ben Wyatt, Leslie was just out with her friends blowing off some steam.
Buddy Wood,What?
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope, Please.
Leslie Knope," Please, please, please."
Leslie Knope, That's five pleases.
Buddy Wood," As much as I enjoy the groveling, I can't destroy the tape because I don't have it, because your sad, tiny backwater airport lost my bags."
Leslie Knope," Oh, really?"
Buddy Wood,"You'd think a commuter airport could handle the luggage of 11 people at once, but apparently not."
Buddy Wood, Completely ruined a great story.
Buddy Wood, Thank God for that mitten factory tragedy.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Ben Wyatt," God, that's"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt, Uh We should yeah.
Ben Wyatt, We're gonna go.
Leslie Knope,Goodbye.
Ben Wyatt," Ah, screw it."
Leslie Knope, Yay! Fun Ben lives.
Ron Swanson," April, Andrew Good morning to you both."
Ron Swanson," Doughnuts, go nuts."
Ron Swanson," Hey, you kids need any money? "
April Ludgate,No.
Ron Swanson, Go buy yourself a Walkman.
Ron Swanson, How much is a Walkman nowadays? Probably more than $20.
Ron Swanson, Here's $25.
Chris Traeger," Hi, guys, I just wanted to come by and thank you for a phenomenal evening."
April Ludgate," Yeah, seems like we all had a phenomenal evening."
Chris Traeger, And I should probably thank you for introducing me to Linda.
Chris Traeger, I think we had a deep emotional connection that is very worth exploring.
Chris Traeger, So I'm gonna ask her out again When she's emotionally ready.
Andy Dwyer,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Ron Great red shirt."
Andy Dwyer," Dude, Ron you have to tell him what happened."
Ron Swanson, Why? It's none of his business.
April Ludgate, Because he's been super sad lately.
April Ludgate, It kind of seems like you should at least give him a heads-up so he doesn't get rejected again.
Ron Swanson, I like to not get involved in these matters or any matters of any nature.
Andy Dwyer," Uh, you know, Ron, someone once told me that this is not how grown-ups deal with tough situations."
Andy Dwyer, We face them head-on.
Ron Swanson, Fine.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, my God, Ron It was you who told me that."
Andy Dwyer, That's crazy.
Chris Traeger, There's that shirt.
Ron Swanson," Look, Chris After the bar last night, I engaged in consensual activities with Linda."
Chris Traeger,I see.
Ron Swanson,I didn't plan it.
Ron Swanson, But it occurred.
Ron Swanson, Now you know.
Chris Traeger," Well, thank you for being forthright and telling me."
Chris Traeger," You're a good man, Ron."
Chris Traeger, I'm quite lonely.
Ron Swanson," Ah, [Bleep]."
Leslie Knope," They say to win an election, you have to be good, and you have to be lucky."
Leslie Knope, I got pretty damn lucky when I met Ben.
Leslie Knope, And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom and all my other friends volunteer to help me out.
Leslie Knope, And I'm super lucky that that tape disappeared.
Leslie Knope, I think we may have used up all our luck tonight.
Leslie Knope," Actually, not all of it."
Leslie Knope, He's about to get lucky.
Leslie Knope," It's, it's on."
Leslie Knope, He doesn't even know it yet.
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, sweetheart."
Tom Haverford," I'm not sure you're even aware of this, but we have now gone 48 hours without breaking up, shattering our previous record."
Ann Perkins, That's not bad.
Tom Haverford,To celebrate
Ann Perkins,"Oh, please, don't."
Ann Perkins," Whatever this is, I don't want it."
Tom Haverford, Just a little 48 hour anniversary gift.
Ann Perkins,Condoms.
Tom Haverford,48 of 'em.
Tom Haverford, Different flavor for each hour.
Ann Perkins," Yeah, we're not dating any more, okay? Get out."

Leslie Knope,Is the coast clear?
Ann Perkins,What are you wearing?
Leslie Knope,My sneak around clothes.
Leslie Knope,Is he gone?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, he's gone."
Ann Perkins,Come in.
Ann Perkins,You gotta see this.
Ann Perkins,"Tom and I have been seeing each other for a few weeks, and I think I'm ready to say, ""I love you"" To his apartment."
Ann Perkins,I love you so much.
Ann Perkins,Look at all these blankets.
Ann Perkins,"One on the ottoman, one on the chair, one on the couch here, feel."
Leslie Knope,"Holy hell, that's soft."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, is that Yep!"
Ann Perkins,A whole shelf of coconut water.
Leslie Knope,I think I'm gonna cry.
Leslie Knope,This is like girl heaven.
Leslie Knope,Did he do all this just for you?
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,He just lives like this.
Ann Perkins,"He's deeply in debt, but you know what?"
Ann Perkins,Who cares!
Ann Perkins,'Cause check it out.
Ann Perkins,Cheese plate and Adriatic figs.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is always here."
Ann Perkins,I don't know when he has time to make it.
Ann Perkins,"Boutique eye cream, unisex cologne, lip exfoliator, chocolate covered almonds, and a Sudoku book just amenities everywhere!"
Leslie Knope,I love amenities.
Ann Perkins,I know!
Ann Perkins,Check this out.
Ann Perkins,It's the best part.
Ann Perkins,Night and day.
Leslie Knope,Look at this one.
Leslie Knope,There's another soft one.
Ann Perkins,Ohh.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, could I have a moment?"
Extra,Make it quick.
Leslie Knope,In his seminal 2009 documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the national park system as a America's best idea.
Extra,Way quicker.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, but you should watch that documentary."
Leslie Knope,"Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen."
Leslie Knope,I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.
Leslie Knope,"If you hear any of them talking about that ""blonde pain in the ass,"" that's me."
Extra,"Leslie, that budget is all but finalized."
Extra,I love building ships in bottles.
Extra,"When the ship is done, I put a cork in it, put it on the shelf, and I move on."
Leslie Knope,"Hold that cork, sir because I'm about to put an adorable face on your proposed cuts."
Leslie Knope,Meet Melody Sternway.
Leslie Knope,She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.
Leslie Knope,Our department is the only thing between her and a life of tube tops and tribal tattoos and barfing in hot tubs.
Leslie Knope,Please.
Extra,"Okay, you got me."
Extra,I'll find the cuts somewhere else.
April Ludgate,"Good morning, everyone!"
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate and I will be filling in for Leslie while she runs for office.
April Ludgate,So the new emergency protocol for the Parks department can be found in your binders.
Extra,What exactly is the chain of command visavis onsite response?
April Ludgate,"You know what, why don't we just say that whoever gets to the emergency first will be in charge?"
Extra,"Okay, so if there's an explosion, say, in Ramset Park and someone from Sewage gets there first, they'd be in charge?"
April Ludgate,I had no idea how terrible Leslie's job is.
April Ludgate,She referred to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride.
April Ludgate,"I'm not quite sure, but Tom can answer that if What are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,Just bouncing some business ideas off Russell Simmons on Twitter.
Tom Haverford,Why?
Extra,"All due respect, miss Ludgate, do you even know what you're doing here?"
April Ludgate,"All due respect, Mr."
April Ludgate,"hamster penis, but no, I don't."
Extra,My last name is Guiles.
April Ludgate,Are you sure?
April Ludgate,Because you look like a hamster penis.
Tom Haverford,What about a cologne that can kill spiders?
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure to inform you that you are a finalist for the job of Assistant City Manager."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, I feel I should remind you that I do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist."
Ron Swanson,"That said, you'd be a fool not to pick me."
Ron Swanson,I will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it means I'm able to further limit reckless government spending.
Ron Swanson,"I mean, I have so many ideas."
Ron Swanson,"Some are simple like ""take down traffic lights"" and ""eliminate the Post Office."""
Ron Swanson,"The bigger ones will be tougher, like ""bring all of this crumbling to the ground."""
Chris Traeger,There is one more step in the vetting process.
Chris Traeger,"You and I will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra."
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure I'm interested in that.
Ron Swanson,"No, I am sure."
Ron Swanson,I am not interested in that.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you and I are very different people, and we have often been at odds."
Chris Traeger,"It is crucial that you and I spend a day spiritually engaged, and consider what it would really mean to work together."
Chris Traeger,"Trust me, you'll love it."
Chris Traeger,I'll see you tomorrow.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wear your yoga pants."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I really wish we would've talked about this first."
Leslie Knope,What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,That's the point.
Ben Wyatt,"You're thinking like a Parks department employee, not a city council candidate."
Ben Wyatt,You're in a campaign literally.
Ben Wyatt,Everything you do right now is politics.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Is this politics?
Ben Wyatt,Ow.
Ben Wyatt,What is what is that?
Ben Wyatt,What why did you do that?
Leslie Knope,I'm in a good mood.
Leslie Knope,Because the city councilor listened to me.
Leslie Knope,It means I have some juice.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, this might be a good thing."
Ben Wyatt,But there's a reason we strategize  before we make decisions.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"I'll make some calls, see where we are."
Leslie Knope,Enjoying the view.
Ben Wyatt,What is going on?
Leslie Knope,I'm just really into you.
Leslie Knope,"Gimme a spin, baby."
April Ludgate,I hate doing Leslie's job.
April Ludgate,I'm filling in for a person who smiles 90% of the time.
April Ludgate,"Tom, can you please help me?"
April Ludgate,Please?
April Ludgate,Or just do it?
Tom Haverford,"Come on, lil sparkle."
Tom Haverford,Don't give up.
Tom Haverford,What does Leslie always say?
April Ludgate,"I don't know, weird stuff about waffles."
Tom Haverford,"She says, ""you get out of a job what you put into it."""
Tom Haverford, You just need to find a project you're passionate about.
Tom Haverford,"For instance, I was incredible at naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge because I care a great deal about signature beverages."
Tom Haverford,The Beeryonce Knowles.
Tom Haverford,"It's just a regular beer, but we put it in a sexyass mug."
Tom Haverford,Pairs nicely with the Jayzima.
Tom Haverford,We bought a bunch of zima when the factory shut down.
April Ludgate,That sounds fun.
April Ludgate,Maybe I should work at a bar.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, there must be some aspect of this job you care about."
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Ron Swanson,Here are some papers Leslie requested.
Ann Perkins,These are blank.
Ron Swanson,Weird.
Ron Swanson,"As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question?"
Ron Swanson,Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"When we dated, he made me do it every week."
Ron Swanson,What am I in for here?
Ann Perkins,"Okay, here's the deal."
Ann Perkins,"It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead."
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,So did Pillner finalize the budget?
Leslie Knope,Are we okay?
Ben Wyatt,We are the opposite of okay.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Ben Wyatt,"To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter."
Ben Wyatt,"The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs."
Ben Wyatt,So they're closing it at the end of the week.
April Ludgate,That's where Champion came from.
Andy Dwyer,What will happen to all the other animals?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they'll be "
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,They'll be
Andy Dwyer,No!
Jerry Gergich,Guys.
Jennifer Barkley,"Apparently, Leslie Knope wielded her insider influence and got Councilman Pillner to save her precious department, even though it meant closing the shelter."
Jennifer Barkley,"Now I am not saying that Leslie Knope is a dog murderer, per se, I just think that her actions raise some questions."
Jennifer Barkley,"Like, for example, is she a dog murderer?"
Ben Wyatt,God.
Perd Hapley,"Well, I don't know the answer to that, Jennifer, but your tone makes me think Yes."
Jennifer Barkley,"Say your goodbyes, Pebble 'Cause ""Weswie"" Knope gonna kill you."
Ben Wyatt,She got the perfect puppy for that shot.
Ben Wyatt,She is good.
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, there is a woman on the phone that says her daughter's scared to go to sleep because Leslie Knope's going to come murder her kitty."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we can fix this."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we can."
Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, we are going back to Pillner and telling him to cut the Parks budget."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,We can figure something else out.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, honey, good morning."
Leslie Knope,How did you sleep?
Leslie Knope,I adopted 32 cats and dogs.
Leslie Knope,Do you want pancakes?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make pancakes.
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Which one?
Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?
Leslie Knope,You talking about this one?
Leslie Knope,This one right here?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that is a pig."
Chris Traeger,This is the best meditation center in the area.
Ron Swanson,It doesn't look like much.
Chris Traeger,"Actually, this strip mall has surprisingly decent chi."
Chris Traeger,"Although, the smells from the Greek restaurant next door are not ideal."
Chris Traeger,"But through this door lies a deep, serene quietude."
Extra,"Excuse me, ladies."
Extra,On your right.
Chris Traeger,"After you, Ron."
Chris Traeger,Now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit.
Chris Traeger,Now quietly sit behind me and let's join breath.
Ron Swanson,I'll stand.
Chris Traeger,Interesting technique.
April Ludgate,"Andy, look at this little guy!"
April Ludgate,He's such a little runt.
April Ludgate,"Hey, there."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Tom, look."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I just had five cats on me at once!"
Andy Dwyer,You wanna come in here and try to break my record?
Tom Haverford,"That's okay, Andy, I think I'm gonna keep my distance."
Tom Haverford,Don't want none of that animal dander interacting with this cashmere.
Ben Wyatt,"What's your endgame here, my dear?"
Leslie Knope,This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.
April Ludgate,"Hey, what if I threw together a pet adoption in one of our parks would that be cool?"
Leslie Knope,"April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show."
April Ludgate,Ew.
April Ludgate,I think I may have found a project I'd actually enjoy doing helping these cats and dogs.
April Ludgate,They should be rewarded for not being people.
April Ludgate,I hate people.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very proud of you, April."
Leslie Knope,"Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben, the pig ate your noise canceling headphones."
Andy Dwyer,Pigs are awesome!
Ron Swanson,"All told, we were in there about six hours."
Ron Swanson,"And no, I was not meditating."
Ron Swanson,"I just stood there, quietly breathing."
Ron Swanson,There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.
Ron Swanson,My mind was blank.
Ron Swanson,I don't know what the hell these other crackpots are doing.
April Ludgate,"Jerry, the puppies are going to the bathroom everywhere."
April Ludgate,We can't let people see that.
April Ludgate,"I need you to continuously clean out the cages, okay?"
Jerry Gergich,"You got it, boss."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Donna, did you put the info sheets on all the cages?"
Donna Meagle,Last one.
April Ludgate,Great.
Donna Meagle,"Each animal has a photo, special talents, and a personal history That I made up."
Donna Meagle,A lot of these dogs have rescued people from burning buildings.
Donna Meagle,This one helped Ray Charles around.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,This cat was in Boogie Nights?
April Ludgate,Hi.
April Ludgate,You like this little guy?
Extra,He's so cute.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,All the animal are uptodate on their shots.
April Ludgate,And I think he likes you.
Andy Dwyer,He's pretty awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Did you know his greatgrandfather was Spuds Mackenzie?
Extra,"What do you think, sweetie?"
Extra,Do you wanna take him home?
Extra,"Yes, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Realistically, I'm guessing we dropped three to five points in the polls."
Ben Wyatt,"This late in the game, it's killer."
Ben Wyatt,And that's a dog biscuit.
Leslie Knope,Andy put them on the table 'cause he wanted to try to have the dogs play poker.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, we are out of time."
Ben Wyatt,We have to go back to them.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,This is it.
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Extra,"Oh, for God's sake, Leslie."
Extra,There's just not enough money to do all the things you wanna do.
Extra,You're trying to fit two ships into one bottle.
Extra,"Take it from me, you can't do that."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just look at this."
Ben Wyatt,"There are three employees designated as D1, or on retainer."
Ben Wyatt,Public Works is still paying them even though they haven't worked in two years.
Leslie Knope,It's an oversight.
Leslie Knope,We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.
Extra,Interesting.
Leslie Knope,Looks like we found a bigger bottle.
Extra,"I know you're just making a joke, but using a bigger bottle would be considered cheating by most of our major trade publications."
Extra,FYI.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've radiated mindfulness."
Chris Traeger,What were you thinking about?
Ron Swanson,I wasn't thinking at all.
Chris Traeger,Incredible.
Chris Traeger,"It takes a ton of work for me to get to that kind of a clear head space, no matter how hard I try."
Ron Swanson,Don't try so hard.
Chris Traeger,Don't try so hard.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I'm going to try your ""not trying"" method right here, right now."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, wait."
Ron Swanson,"I know this crap is important to you, so I should come clean."
Ron Swanson,I got nothing out of that experience at all.
Ron Swanson,So if you're looking for someone who enjoys meditation
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I didn't expect you to enjoy it."
Chris Traeger,My one reservation about you as a coworker was that you seem inflexible.
Chris Traeger,"And merely by agreeing to an activity you're not interested in, you showed flexibility."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've got the job."
Chris Traeger,You wanna head back?
Ron Swanson,I do.
Ron Swanson,"But first, there's a hot, spinning cone of meat in that Greek restaurant next door."
Ron Swanson,"I don't know what it is, but I'd like to eat the whole thing."
April Ludgate,Why is it so dead?
April Ludgate,Where is everyone?
Tom Haverford,Don't give up yet.
Tom Haverford,There's a few minutes left.
Extra,Is this where we drop off our unwanted cats?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,It's the opposite.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,I'm just gonna put these here for a second.
Extra,"And then, uh"
Andy Dwyer,We ended up with more animals than we started with.
April Ludgate,This is what happens when you try.
April Ludgate,All of these animals are gonna die.
April Ludgate,God!
April Ludgate,"I hope you're happy, stupid people in this stupid town!"
April Ludgate,Hey!
April Ludgate,"Hey, you!"
April Ludgate,Get back here and get your [Bleep] cats out of there!
Leslie Knope,Do you think Barack and Michelle Obama feel like this at the end of the day?
Ben Wyatt,Probably.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I don't know how else wait a second."
Ben Wyatt,Is that so am I Michelle?
Ann Perkins,"Hey, how is everyone?"
Leslie Knope,Great!
Ben Wyatt,Pretty good.
Leslie Knope,We saved the animal shelter and the Parks budget.
Ann Perkins,That's great news.
Ann Perkins,Let me guess.
Ann Perkins,You found room in other parts of the budget somewhere?
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,Got rid of a bunch of lameass D1's from Public Works.
Ann Perkins,Awesome news.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you know what else is pretty neat, is thanks to you, councilman Pillner went through the budget and decided that not just Public Works but all D1's will be terminated in two weeks."
Ann Perkins,I'm getting fired.
Leslie Knope,what now?
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Councilman Houser I was just looking for you.
Chris Traeger,I have found my assistant city manager.
Chris Traeger,You wanna guess who it is?
Chris Traeger,It's Ron Swanson!
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,I should've let you guess.
Chris Traeger,I'm just so excited.
Councilman Houser,I'd put a pin in this for now.
Chris Traeger,Why?
Chris Traeger,Why pin it?
Councilman Houser,The council vote is three to two in favor of another term for you.
Councilman Houser,But one of the yes votes is retiring.
Councilman Houser,"If Bobby Newport wins, he's gonna try to bring in his own guy."
Chris Traeger,Why would he do that?
Councilman Houser,He's not exactly thrilled you've been volunteering for the Knope campaign in your spare time.
Councilman Houser,"Sorry, Chris."
Councilman Houser,If Newport wins You're gone.
Leslie Knope,I just need one more week.
Leslie Knope,And then I think 
Extra,"Sorry, could you please Be careful?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I am always careful."
Andy Dwyer,We're good.
Leslie Knope,"If I could just get a little bit more time, I could figure out how to fix this."
Extra,"Unfortunately, I cannot give you any more time."
Leslie Knope,With due respect
Extra,"Leslie, I am retiring at the end of this term, so I've been fine with you guys pushing me around on this budget thing."
Extra,"But if you're ever gonna hold this job, there's something you need to understand."
Extra,City Council isn't about making everybody in town happy.
Extra,"In fact, every decision you make is gonna make a lot of people very unhappy."
Extra,We play with live ammo around here.
Extra,Now I'm gonna close the book on this budget draft by the end of the business day.
Extra,So if you can find some way out of this mess by 5:00 P.M.
Extra,you let me know.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,That's fair.
Andy Dwyer,I did it!
Andy Dwyer,I got it out.
Extra,"Oh, geez."
Extra,You don't take the ship out.
Andy Dwyer,Here you go.
Ron Swanson,Chris!
Ron Swanson,Great news!
Ron Swanson,I found a way to reduce government spending by 85%.
Ron Swanson,Here's a hint no more departments.
Chris Traeger,"Ha, that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait."
Chris Traeger,"Turns out that Bobby Newport, if he beats Leslie, is going to appoint his own city manager."
Chris Traeger,So I may have offered you a job that I have no authority to offer.
Chris Traeger,I'm so so sorry.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that is disappointing."
Ron Swanson,But don't worry about me.
Ron Swanson,I'll be fine.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I know."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, in the grand scheme of things, who cares?"
Chris Traeger," We're all just molecules, floating around in random patterns Devoid of meaning."
Chris Traeger," Well, I'll see you when I see you."
Chris Traeger, I'm a rolling stone.
Chris Traeger,Peace.
Ron Swanson,Stop.
Ron Swanson, Have a seat.
Ron Swanson," We did things your way, now we're gonna do it my way."
Ron Swanson, Prepare to experience true freedom and bliss.
Ann Perkins," Oh, maybe I should just go back to being a nurse full-time."
Leslie Knope," No, I will not let you return to a life of shaving wieners and dodging knife attacks from meth heads."
Ann Perkins, Right.
Ann Perkins," Okay, what are you gonna do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, either you get fired, the Parks budget shrinks, or the animal shelter's gotta go."
Leslie Knope, Or we find money somewhere else.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, Leslie, there is nowhere else."
Ben Wyatt," This is a town budget, not a bottomless trust fund."
Ben Wyatt, Okay? Money doesn't just appear out of nowhere.
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope, Stop talking.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Leslie Knope, I have half an idea and I'm putting it together.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Hey! 
Ann Perkins,Do you wanna
Leslie Knope, Heh.
Leslie Knope,I'm No!
Ann Perkins,Do you? Unh.
Leslie Knope, Shh.
Leslie Knope," Okay, now I have a complete idea."
Leslie Knope," Ben, I'm going to commit political suicide."
Tom Haverford," Hey, it's me."
Tom Haverford, Tommy!
April Ludgate,I'm not here.
Tom Haverford, April.
April Ludgate, Swear on my great-great-grandmother's grave I'm not here.
Tom Haverford, I'm gonna come in for a second.
April Ludgate, Can you just leave me alone?
Tom Haverford,"Why so glum, sugar plum?"
April Ludgate," Um, I don't know."
April Ludgate, Maybe because I worked so hard on that dumb pet adoption and I failed.
April Ludgate, That's why it's stupid to work hard.
Tom Haverford, Let me show you something.
Tom Haverford," Because you worked hard, this little terribly-dressed girl has a puppy."
Tom Haverford, And this little puppy has a home.
Tom Haverford," If Leslie's taught me anything, it's that yes, this job is frustrating and you hit brick walls."
Tom Haverford," But the other 2%, it's stuff like this kid."
Tom Haverford, And that puppy.
Tom Haverford, What what is that photo? That must come preloaded in there or something.
April Ludgate," - Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford, - See you at work tomorrow?
April Ludgate,Fine.
Tom Haverford, All right.
Tom Haverford," Bye, pups! Bye, little piggies!"
Chris Traeger,"I don't usually poison my body with dark alcohol, but this whiskey is excellent!"
Ron Swanson,Nectar of the gods.
Chris Traeger," Well, I should get back to my office."
Chris Traeger, As long as I have one.
Ron Swanson," Chris, I'm not one for positive thinking or visualization or meditation or really anything in the world that you believe in."
Ron Swanson, But you might consider the upside of losing your job.
Chris Traeger, For example?
Ron Swanson,"You would no longer be a government parasite, sucking the lifeblood from honest, hardworking people."
Ron Swanson," Instead, you'd contribute to society like a man."
Ron Swanson, That's just one way it might be good.
Ron Swanson, I'm sure there are others.
Chris Traeger, I'm sure there are.
Jennifer Barkley, Uh-oh.
Jennifer Barkley, You look serious.
Jennifer Barkley, What's on the agenda?
Leslie Knope,"Just one item, Jennifer."
Leslie Knope, You're going to announce that Bobby Newport will use his personal fortune to save the animal shelter.
Jennifer Barkley, No.
Jennifer Barkley," No, that's that's, um that is a great idea."
Jennifer Barkley," In fact, I don't know why I hadn't thought of it already."
Jennifer Barkley, Damn it.
Jennifer Barkley, Damn it! I swear the air in this town is killing my brain cells.
Leslie Knope," Actually, the water's not good for you either."
Leslie Knope, You shouldn't drink the tap water.
Leslie Knope, Has anyone told you that yet?
Ben Wyatt,"In exchange, no more puppy killer ads for the rest of the campaign."
Ben Wyatt,That's all we ask.
Jennifer Barkley, Okay.
Jennifer Barkley," Well, what's to stop me from just paying for the shelter and still running the ads?"
Leslie Knope,"Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget."
Ben Wyatt," And we'll leak that it was Leslie's decision and yours seem tough and fair, what with sacrificing her old department"
Jennifer Barkley," Okay, what's in it for you? "
Leslie Knope,"A safe home for the animals, a job for my friend, and a full Parks budget."
Jennifer Barkley, I wasn't born yesterday.
Jennifer Barkley, You've gotta have an angle.
Jennifer Barkley, This is a home run for us! We're gonna dominate the news cycle for a whole week.
Ben Wyatt," Well, you can have this week."
Ben Wyatt, We'll take the next one.
Jennifer Barkley," Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?"
Leslie Knope,"Because in a week, we have a debate."
Leslie Knope," And your guy Bobby Newport is gonna have to show up, and he's gonna have to open his mouth."
Leslie Knope, And I'm gonna kick his ass.
Leslie Knope, She'll take care of that.
Leslie Knope, See ya next week!
Chris Traeger,How's my best buddy? Just bought this.
Chris Traeger, Cranium.
Chris Traeger, It's a board game.
Chris Traeger, Have you heard of it? It is literally the most fun I have ever had.
Chris Traeger," What do you say, after work, you, me, whiskey, wheatgrass, Cranium? Ron?"
April Ludgate,"Chris? Sorry, he's meditating."
April Ludgate, He asked me to tell anyone who comes in that he wishes to remain undisturbed so as to better clarify his head space.
Chris Traeger," Oh, God, Ron."
Chris Traeger, I am so sorry.
Chris Traeger, I'll let you get at it.

Ben Wyatt,"Okay, everybody, latest poll is Newport, 40%, Leslie, 32%, with everyone else way back."
Ben Wyatt,Now this debate is our best chance to close that gap.
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, Ann, and Tom, you guys will be talking to reporters, providing facts, general spin."
Ann Perkins,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,This is the best possible job for me.
Chris Traeger,I can literally make anything sound positive.
Tom Haverford,"Your house just burned down, and you lost all your money in the stock market."
Chris Traeger,It's a chance to start over.
Chris Traeger,"Fire is cleansing, and true wealth is measured by the amount of love in your life."
Chris Traeger,"If I had to have anybody tell me that I had cancer, I would want it to be me."
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, April, and Andy, you'll be throwing a party for our biggest donors."
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I can't believe our house is going to be full of rich people named Dottie and Todd and Rick."
Leslie Knope,Is the menu all set?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I will be providing several slabs of my world famous Swanson ribs."
April Ludgate,And I will be providing my world famous $100 lap dances.
Andy Dwyer,Sweet!
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,The election is in two weeks.
Ben Wyatt,The debate is in nine hours.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get to work.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Can't believe we're doing this here.
Leslie Knope,"Seats, like, 800 people."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's what you get when your opponent's the most famous person in town."
Leslie Knope,This is a lot bigger than my high school debate auditorium.
Ben Wyatt,4 feet. Exact same size as the podium you use in the Parks department.
Ben Wyatt,Opening statement.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Ben Wyatt,You got this.
Leslie Knope,I got this.
Ben Wyatt,You could debate Newport in your sleep.
Leslie Knope,I have.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,We sleep in the same bed.
Ben Wyatt,It's been hell.
Leslie Knope,I finally get a chance to stand in front of everyone and talk about the town that I love.
Leslie Knope,What if the town loves Bobby more than me?
Ben Wyatt,There's no way.
Ben Wyatt,You're going to destroy him.
Ben Wyatt,I'm going to wipe the floor with his face.
Ben Wyatt,You're going to rip out his spine with your teeth and then chew it up and gargle with it.
Leslie Knope,I love it when you're needlessly disgusting.
April Ludgate,"I'm trying to clean up for the party, but I swear to God, my arms can't move that way."
Tom Haverford,Leave it messy.
Tom Haverford,It doesn't matter.
Tom Haverford,Nothing matters.
Tom Haverford,Life is garbage.
April Ludgate,What happened?
Tom Haverford,Ann broke up with me.
Tom Haverford,For reals this time.
Tom Haverford,And all I did was call into this radio station and give her a sweet little shoutout.
Tom Haverford,So we're up in the club.
Tom Haverford,It's me!
Tom Haverford,We're dancing.
Tom Haverford,We're sweating.
Tom Haverford,Let's just say we got to second that night.
Tom Haverford,Kind of.
Extra,Me so horny.
Tom Haverford,This chick's name is Ann Perkins.
Tom Haverford,Look her up on the government website.
Tom Haverford,She is crazy hot.
Tom Haverford,Isn't that great?
Tom Haverford,Come here.
Tom Haverford,Aah!
Tom Haverford,I complimented you.
Tom Haverford,I guess she's just afraid of how powerful her feelings are.
April Ludgate,"Dude, that's not why she broke up with you."
April Ludgate,You have to stop your stupid swagger and just tell her in a normal voice that you care about her.
Tom Haverford,What do you know?
Tom Haverford,You don't care about things.
April Ludgate,"Yes, I do, I care about Andy And champion."
April Ludgate,"And I want Leslie to win, and I like sleeping."
April Ludgate,So everybody has things they care about.
April Ludgate,"If Ann is yours, you need to tell her."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Chris, hypothetical crisis."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie just tried to answer a question and audibly farted then threw up.
Ben Wyatt,Spin.
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope is literally overflowing with ideas for this town.
Chris Traeger,"And speaking of methane, have you heard about her plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions?"
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Nice.
Chris Traeger,Spin team!
Ann Perkins,Spin team!
Chris Traeger,Ann and I make such a great team.
Chris Traeger,It's silly that we're not a team in real life.
Chris Traeger,"I just heard those words come out of my mouth, and I have made a decision."
Chris Traeger,I've heard that you and Tom Haverford are no longer romantically involved.
Chris Traeger,Is that true?
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we broke up."
Ann Perkins,And I honestly can't believe we ever dated.
Chris Traeger,Does defy logic.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, I still have feelings for you."
Chris Traeger,Strong feelings.
Chris Traeger,"Emotional, primal feelings."
Chris Traeger,And I would like to give our relationship another try.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, we dated for, like, three months a year ago."
Ann Perkins,I honestly think that you've built this into something that it wasn't.
Ann Perkins,"And according to your rule, we can't date because you're my boss."
Chris Traeger,Maybe not for long.
Chris Traeger,"If Newport wins, the city council may replace me."
Chris Traeger,But it would open it up for us to be together.
Chris Traeger,Would you like that?
Chris Traeger,Don't answer.
Chris Traeger,Just think about it.
Chris Traeger,Come on.
Chris Traeger,Let's spin.
Extra,So you do a lot of investing?
Andy Dwyer,We like to dabble.

Ben Wyatt,Opening statement.
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,I've worked my whole life to make it great.
Leslie Knope,I believe I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,I have the best campaign manager in the world.
Ben Wyatt,I wouldn't say that.
Ben Wyatt,Jen's a killer.
Ben Wyatt,You can beat Newport.
Ben Wyatt,I don't know if I can beat her.
Leslie Knope,Here's what I know.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, and I like you."
Ben Wyatt,"I love you, and I like you."
Extra,And the home of the   brave 
Ben Wyatt,Your boy looks a little lost out there.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, he'll be fine."
Jennifer Barkley,Expectations are crazy low.
Jennifer Barkley,"If he puts two sentences together without crying, the press is going to say he's doing surprisingly well, and if he falls to pieces, he's going to look sympathetic."
Jennifer Barkley,It's a win win.
Jennifer Barkley,So do you have any idea how long this is going to take?
Perd Hapley,"Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the event we are doing tonight, which is a city council candidate debate that we're going to start now."
Perd Hapley,I'm Perd Hapley.
Joan Callamezzo,"And I am legendary newswoman Joan Callamezzo, newly single."
Joan Callamezzo,It's time for opening statements.
Fester Trim,I am Fester Trim.
Fester Trim,Many of you know me as the man who sells you your guns at the gunbelievable Gun Emporium.
Extra,Whoo!
Fester Trim,I want to tell you about my idea for assault rifle vending machines.
Brandi Maxxxx,"You might be thinking, ""what does an adult film star know about politics?"
Brandi Maxxxx,""" Well, I've produced and starred in over 400 adult films this year alone."
Extra,Whoo!
Brandi Maxxxx,Thank you.
Brandi Maxxxx,"And just like Leslie, I know what it's like to be the only woman in a room full of men."
Manrico Della Rossa,I am Manrico Della Rossa.
Manrico Della Rossa,I believe animals are as important as people.
Manrico Della Rossa,"And if elected, I will fight for them as if they are my own children."
Leslie Knope,I am Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"I love this town, and I've worked my whole life to make it great."
Leslie Knope,I believe that I've earned your vote.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport believes he can buy it.
Leslie Knope,And maybe that's because he's never earned anything his entire life.
Bobby Newport,That that hurt my feelings.
Bobby Newport,Hurt my feelings.
Bobby Newport,You're supposed to be this positive person.
Bobby Newport,Can't we just talk about things we like?
Joan Callamezzo,Well said.
Joan Callamezzo,"Uh, just a reminder to our candidates to keep it civil."
Joan Callamezzo,"Looking at you, Leslie."
Bobby Newport,"Ah, that's okay, Joan."
Bobby Newport,I'm okay.
Bobby Newport,"I'm just I'm nervous, man."
Bobby Newport,I'm nervous.
Bobby Newport,Gah.
Bobby Newport,"I guess I want to do a good job because, um, I like it when people think I do a good job."
Bobby Newport,And I want your vote because I want Pawnee and my dad to see what I'm made of.
Bobby Newport,So let's do this.
Bobby Newport,The wrecking crew.
Bobby Newport,Who let you guys in?
Bobby Newport,"Hey, Jason."
Ben Wyatt,Ease back.
Joan Callamezzo,"This question about public safety comes from Twitter because apparently, that's something that happens now."
Joan Callamezzo,"@munchmeat2015 asks, ""Pawnee used 2 b safe."
Joan Callamezzo,"""Some1 stole my car."
Joan Callamezzo,"""What will u do ""2 make Pawnee safe & can u help me find my car?"
Fester Trim,""" I can assure you, if you had a gun mounted on the dashboard, which automatically shot people trying to break into it, you would still have your car."
Bobby Newport,"You know, I guess I would like to tell Mr."
Bobby Newport,Munchmeat that I think that stinks that happened to him.
Bobby Newport,"You know, one time a guy stole some downhill skis out of my jeep."
Bobby Newport,"And I was so mad, I punched a mailbox."
Bobby Newport,"I'm against crime, and I'm not ashamed to admit it."
April Ludgate,I can't get through to the cable company.
April Ludgate,Can you do something?
Ron Swanson,Like what?
April Ludgate,Anything.
April Ludgate,Andy's just acting out scenes from his favorite movies.
Andy Dwyer,"So Swayze runs, boom!"
Andy Dwyer,Tackles the guy off the motorcycle.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude's like, ""you're dead, bro!"
Andy Dwyer,""" Comes at him."
Andy Dwyer,"Swayze ducks, scissor kick."
Andy Dwyer,Sha!
Andy Dwyer,The guy has Swayze's head.
Andy Dwyer,"And he says, ""I used to [Bleep] guys like you in prison."
Andy Dwyer,""" By the looks of this guy, this is not consensual sex we're talking about."
Andy Dwyer,We see bad guy had a gun the whole time.
Andy Dwyer,"He's like, ""I'ma kill you the oldfashioned way."
Andy Dwyer,""" Swayze's like, ""not this time."
Andy Dwyer,""" That's subtext."
Andy Dwyer,He doesn't say that.
Andy Dwyer,"Bypasses the gun, hooks the arm."
Andy Dwyer,"Back to the secret move he used before to kill somebody, he feels so bad about it."
Andy Dwyer,But this time he has to do it because it's selfdefense.
Andy Dwyer,Kkkkah!
Andy Dwyer,Takes the esophagus out of the neck area.
Andy Dwyer,You can't eat.
Andy Dwyer,You'll starve to death.
Andy Dwyer,And that is Road House.
Andy Dwyer,What should I do next?
Joan Callamezzo,Leslie Knope.
Joan Callamezzo,This question is about Pawnee's park system.
Joan Callamezzo,Why is Ramsett Park so filthy and awful?
Leslie Knope,It's difficult to get into the complicated problems with Ramsett Park in such a short amount of time.
Perd Hapley,You have 20 seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, okay."
Leslie Knope,I will say that the parks in Pawnee
Perd Hapley,"I do have an update on your time allotment, and that update is that your time is almost gone."
Leslie Knope,I have no more time left?
Perd Hapley,"Well, you had some time when I started talking, but by the time I finished, your time was up."
Perd Hapley,Thank you very much.
Jennifer Barkley,She's off her game.
Ben Wyatt,She's fine.
Joan Callamezzo,"Mr. Newport, rebuttal."
Bobby Newport,I know this.
Bobby Newport,"If something is dirty, we should clean it up."
Bobby Newport,Let's start there.
Bobby Newport,Right?
Bobby Newport,"You know what, I had this cleaning lady named Yolanda who was very wise."
Bobby Newport,She basically raised me.
Bobby Newport,"And one day she said, ""little Bobby, I'm not going to clean your room no mas."
Bobby Newport,""" And from that day on, my room was gross."
Bobby Newport,Really bummed me out.
Bobby Newport,"I think we should make our parks look like my room after Yolanda finally, you know, gave in and cleaned it up for me."
Leslie Knope,"If I may, Joan."
Leslie Knope,"That's a very sweet story, Bobby, but not all of us have Yolandas who can clean up our room for us."
Leslie Knope,Some of us believe that you need to roll up your sleeves and do the hard work yourself.
Brandi Maxxxx,"I'd just like to say that, like Leslie, I don't have people do my work for me."
Brandi Maxxxx,Leslie and I do our work ourselves.
Brandi Maxxxx,"My work, of course, is having sex with men and women on camera."
Joan Callamezzo,"Once again, Brandi and Leslie are essentially the same person."
Tom Haverford,"But Bobby Newport is super handsome and charming, so that means people will probably vote for him because there's no justice in the world."
Extra,How do you respond to Newport's claim that the city parks need to be cleaned up?
Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope works tirelessly every day, so our parks can be the best they can be."
Ann Perkins,"78% of Pawneeans label our parks ""pristine."""
Tom Haverford,"And we all know the better looking a park is, the more attention it will get from lady parks who want to have sex with it."
Ann Perkins,Excuse us.
Ann Perkins,What the hell is wrong with you?
Ann Perkins,We're fighting for our lives out there.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, I don't know."
Tom Haverford,"Maybe the fact that we just broke up, and you're already riding the Traeger train."
Ann Perkins,What are you talking about?
Tom Haverford,I saw you guys getting back together.
Tom Haverford,What about us?
Ann Perkins,"What about us, Tom?"
Ann Perkins,We're not together any more because you keep acting like an ass.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"I just act that way sometimes Because I'm nervous, and I feel like you're out of my league."
Tom Haverford,But I'd do anything to get back together with you.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,Vote for me to be your boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, he's winning."
Leslie Knope,How is he winning?
Leslie Knope,"Everything he's saying is nonsense, and he's fooling them."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you're doing fine."
Leslie Knope,I need to go back on the attack.
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"See, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"When you attacked, you kind of came off like a bully, and he looked sympathetic, so, you know, you did a really good job of easing off."
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, this is fun, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Fester Trim,"Well, there's no reason on earth that I can think of that we shouldn't have concussion grenades in our nation's movie theaters."
Bobby Newport,"By the year 2013, we will have a fully functional mall on Jupiter."
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I agree that movies should be more faithful to the books that they are based on, but what does that have to do with this election?"
Brandi Maxxxx,All my movies are based on books.
Manrico Della Rossa,And anyone who even rubs their hands on a leather jacket should be tried for murder.
Bobby Newport,I'm an American.
Bobby Newport,My father is an American.
Bobby Newport,My mother is an American.
Bobby Newport,My godfather is the viceroy of the principality of Liechtenstein.
Fester Trim,"Once again, people, grenade launcher."
Bobby Newport,Daniel Craig.
Bobby Newport,No Timothy Dalton.
Leslie Knope,"I was in favor of closing the borders bookstore, not the border to Mexico."
Bobby Newport,"I guess my thoughts on abortion are You know, let's just all have a good time."
Fester Trim,I don't care about that issue.
Fester Trim,Just ask someone else.
Brandi Maxxxx,"For the record, I'd appear in a film with any of my fellow candidates."
Manrico Della Rossa,Anteaters.
Fester Trim,Kill shot.
Brandi Maxxxx,Money shot.
Bobby Newport,Fudgsicles.
Leslie Knope,Let's spend our money on what matters.
Leslie Knope,"Police, fire, parks, and schools."
Jennifer Barkley,"After a rough start, your girl's doing okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, I think she's doing a little better than okay."
Ben Wyatt,Or did you miss the applause she got on the raccoon safety question?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, that was great."
Jennifer Barkley,That probably pulled her even with Bobby.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you're so casual about this.
Ben Wyatt,Don't you even want to win the debate?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, we're gonna win the debate."
Jennifer Barkley,Got an ace in the hole.
Jennifer Barkley,Little surpriseywisey.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, you'll see."
Jennifer Barkley,"Hey, quick question."
Jennifer Barkley,"Does that guy Chris Traeger have a girlfriend, and is his penis normal?"
Ben Wyatt,Stop talking.
Andy Dwyer,"You guys, uh, know anything about a guy named John Rambo?"
Andy Dwyer,Open on villagers being thrown out into a rice field.
Andy Dwyer,Land mines blowing them up into pieces.
Ron Swanson,"After I steal this cable feed, I will repay the cable company for the service we used."
Joan Callamezzo,This last question before the break is for Mr. Newport
Joan Callamezzo,"Uh, some not me have criticized your involvement with your father's candy company Sweetums."
Joan Callamezzo,Would your affiliation with big business affect your decisions as a city councilor?
Bobby Newport,I want to run this town like a business.
Bobby Newport,"My opponent, Leslie Knope, has a very antibusiness agenda."
Bobby Newport,"Recently, my dad told me that if Leslie Knope wins the election, they'll probably have to move Sweetums to Mexico."
Bobby Newport,"That would be terrible, of course."
Bobby Newport,"Thousands of people in this town would lose their jobs, and we all wouldn't have candy."
Bobby Newport,"Now, I'm not saying that is gonna happen, but I do know this."
Bobby Newport,If I win I bet I could get them to stay.
Perd Hapley,Wow.
Perd Hapley,Shocking stuff.
Perd Hapley,"We're gonna be back with our closing statements right after a word from our sponsor, Sweetums, Pawnee's biggest supplier of candy and jobs."
Perd Hapley,Stick around.
Leslie Knope,So Sweetums is gonna move to Mexico if Bobby doesn't win?
Leslie Knope,How could they do that to this town?
Leslie Knope,What a crappy stunt to pull.
Extra,One minute back.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,I think we attack him.
Leslie Knope,He's more confident now.
Leslie Knope,I have to attack him.
Ben Wyatt,And say what?
Ben Wyatt,We didn't plan for this.
Ben Wyatt,What would you even say?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'll figure out as I'm saying it.
Leslie Knope,Just let me attack him.
Leslie Knope,I want to attack him.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's too risky.
Ben Wyatt,Just go with the closing statement we rehearsed.
Ben Wyatt,"Add a line at the end about how you're pro business, and we'll deal with the fallout tomorrow, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,What's the matter with you?
Leslie Knope,I can do it.
Leslie Knope,I can crush him.
Leslie Knope,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, screw it."
Ben Wyatt,Go get him.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Kick his ass.
Ron Swanson,I am lineman for the county   and the Wichita lineman   Is still the line
Perd Hapley, The final thing these candidates will say are their closing statements.
Perd Hapley,"We will begin with our first candidate to go, Bobby Newport."
Bobby Newport,How do we fix this town?
Bobby Newport,I have no idea.
Bobby Newport,You tell me.
Bobby Newport,That's what I'm counting on.
Bobby Newport,You telling me.
Andy Dwyer,And that's how it ends.
Andy Dwyer,I loved it.
Andy Dwyer,It's called Babe.
Andy Dwyer,And I know it sounds corny.
Andy Dwyer,Talking pig.
Andy Dwyer,Whatever.
Andy Dwyer,You should all see it.
Donna Meagle,I feel like I just did.
April Ludgate,It's on.
Perd Hapley,"And, Leslie Knope, closing statement?"
Leslie Knope,I'm very angry.
Leslie Knope,I'm angry that Bobby Newport would hold this town hostage and threaten to leave if you don't give him what he wants.
Leslie Knope,It's despicable.
Leslie Knope,Corporations are not allowed to dictate what a city needs.
Leslie Knope,That power belongs to the people.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and his daddy would like you to think it belongs to them.
Leslie Knope,I love this town.
Leslie Knope,"And when you love something, you don't threaten it."
Leslie Knope,You don't punish it.
Leslie Knope,You fight for it.
Leslie Knope,You take care of it.
Leslie Knope,You put it first.
Leslie Knope," As your city councilor, I will make sure that no one takes advantage of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope," If I seem too passionate, it's because I care."
Leslie Knope," If I come on strong, it's because I feel strongly."
Leslie Knope," And if push too hard, it's because things aren't moving fast enough."
Leslie Knope, This is my home.
Leslie Knope, You are my family.
Leslie Knope, And I promise you I'm not going anywhere.
Bobby Newport," Holy [Bleep], Leslie, that was awesome."
Leslie Knope," Thanks, Bobby."
Andy Dwyer, Yeah! Play it.
Andy Dwyer, Woo-hoo! Knope 2012! Hyah! Hyah! Ron!
Chris Traeger,What the voters saw tonight is an undeniable fact.
Chris Traeger," That one of these candidates is right for this town, and one of them is not."
Chris Traeger," Thanks, guys."
Chris Traeger, Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,Uh-oh.
Ann Perkins," I'm sorry, Chris."
Ann Perkins, It's very flattering.
Ann Perkins," I just, I just don't think it's a good idea."
Chris Traeger, It was worth a shot.
Chris Traeger," Well, I hope that whoever you end up with treats like you like the amazing person that you are."
Ann Perkins, Thank you.
Chris Traeger, And I am going to go run some stairs and work through these feelings.
Tom Haverford,Is he sad?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford, He looks sad.
Ann Perkins, I'm not going out with Chris again.
Tom Haverford, Does that mean we're getting back together?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins, I don't know.
Ann Perkins," No, not right now."
Ann Perkins, There's a chance I'm never gonna date anyone ever again.
Tom Haverford, I'll take it.
Tom Haverford," And you know what else? I'm coming for you, girl Just Like You Want."
Ann Perkins," Just get out there and spin, man."
Tom Haverford, You got it.
Tom Haverford, Leslie Knope is scrappy like a terrier.
Tom Haverford, She's smooth like a blended whiskey.
Tom Haverford," My girl has big ideas and big feelings, and she's not afraid to express them."
Leslie Knope,Was I too mean?
Ben Wyatt,"No, you were perfect."
Ann Perkins,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it was amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope," Hey, how was the spin room?"
Ann Perkins,It was a lot.
Ann Perkins, We'll talk about it.
Bobby Newport," Woo! We did it! We did it! Oh, my God, I was so nervous, but we completely go through it."
Bobby Newport," I haven't felt this good since I scored that lacrosse goal at state, seriously."
Bobby Newport," Hey, party at my dad's lake house."
Bobby Newport, Bring whoever you want.
Andy Dwyer," Scrawny Christians, missionaries, come to him, and they're like, ""Are you John Rambo?"" He's like, ""yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"And they're like, ""we need you to take us upriver."""
Andy Dwyer,"And he's like, ""it's a war zone up there."""
Andy Dwyer,"And they're like, ""yeah, we know."""
Andy Dwyer, We're gonna change things.
Andy Dwyer,"And he's like, ""you bringing any weapons?"" They're like, ""of course not."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Then you're not changing anything."""
Andy Dwyer, Go home.
Andy Dwyer,""" And then they come back in a rainstorm."""
Andy Dwyer," This time he says, ""nope."""
Andy Dwyer, Go home.
Andy Dwyer,They go home again.
Andy Dwyer," Bottom line, they go upriver."
Andy Dwyer, Does not go well.

Leslie Knope,And I can see in the crowd president Obama smiling at me.
Leslie Knope,He made it.
Leslie Knope,"I didn't think he would come, but he made it."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,"A few days ago, on a routine campaign stop in downtown Pawnee, one Leslie Knope pause was attacked play by a pie."

Chris Traeger,"Millicent Gergich, Ann Perkins, Andy's professor lots of disappointment, but if I keep my body moving and my mind occupied at all times, I will avoid falling into a bottomless pit of despair."
Ann Perkins,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next city councilor of the great city of Pawnee, Leslie Knope!"
Andy Dwyer,"This is ""eagle one,"" ""been there, done that"" is leaving the stage."
Andy Dwyer,"""I'd be lying if I said I hadn't thought about it"" is in position."
Leslie Knope,What do we want for our city?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I want.
Leslie Knope,"I want better schools, I want cleaner streets, I want to expel the violent gangs of geese in Detweiler Square."
Leslie Knope,And I will finally eliminate this city's libraries!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"In the last few weeks, we've turned this campaign into a well oiled machine."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie's stump speech is 10 minutes and 40 seconds every time.
Ben Wyatt,"Here, check this out."
Ben Wyatt,There will be a big laugh right now.
Ben Wyatt,"And now, a two second awkward silence after Leslie does her Rodney Dangerfield impression."
Leslie Knope,"I tell ya, these geese don't give me no respect."
Leslie Knope,No respect at all.
Ben Wyatt,"She insists on trying it every time, and it never works."
Ben Wyatt,"But the rest of the speech, fantastic."
Leslie Knope,"When I was building parks, helping the community, and putting together the harvest festival, where was Bobby?"
Leslie Knope,"He and his father, Nick Newport were exploiting this city for their personal gain."
Leslie Knope,You deserve more.
Ben Wyatt,Here's the best part.
Ben Wyatt,Watch what happens when she says
Leslie Knope,"Together, we can build a better Pawnee."
Music,Get on your feet 
Ben Wyatt,"Everybody says they care about the issues, but at the end of the day, all anyone really wants is free clothing shot at them from a cannon."
Andy Dwyer,I've been staring at this board for days.
Andy Dwyer,I'm so close to putting it together.
Andy Dwyer,There's got to be something we missed.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go over this again.
Andy Dwyer,"The video shows that the pie came from a high angle, so it would've hit your face like this."
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Andy Dwyer,Don't close your eyes.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh No, no."
Andy Dwyer,It was actually from up higher.
Andy Dwyer,Is that about right?
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Good.
Andy Dwyer,Clean yourself up.
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this again.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Bill!"
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford from the Knope campaign.
Bill,"And you brought the whole posse with you, huh?"
BIll,I'm not changing my mind.
Ron Swanson,"We already paid for those vans, Mr. Butler."
Ron Swanson,$900 for one day.
Bill,"Yeah, it was $900, but now it's $10,000."
Donna Meagle,Excuse me?
Bill,The Newport campaign offered me 10 grand to just rent the vans and park them somewhere.
BIll,"So I'm going to tear up your contract, and I'm going to take the money."
Bill,Anything else?
Bill,No?
BIll,Great.
Donna Meagle,"Well, what now?"
Tom Haverford,He's just playing hardball.
Tom Haverford,Let me tell you how it's gonna go down.
Tom Haverford,"In a few minutes, we'll walk in there, we'll give him our demands, and then, bam!"
Tom Haverford,I start crying.
Tom Haverford,"We need the vans, so please, give the vans, please?"
Tom Haverford,We need the vans.
Leslie Knope,"And if elected, I promise to stop the Newports and Sweetums from blatantly dumping contaminants into the Pawnee river."
Extra,"Leslie, can you comment on Bobby's father Nick Newport?"
Leslie Knope,Nick Newport has been intimidating and bullying and poisoning this town for years.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk, and if he thinks he can buy this election for his son, he's wrong."
Extra,"Sorry, I meant can you comment on Nick Newport dying earlier today?"
Leslie Knope,He died?
Leslie Knope,I Sad.
Extra,Is that your official statement?
Extra,"""I sad""?"
Leslie Knope,"No, my official statement is that is overall, a bummer."
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Leslie Knope,And and together we can build a better Pawnee.
Music,Get on your feet 
Leslie Knope,"No, this is isn't the time."
Leslie Knope,"No, guys."
Music,Get up and make it happen 
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, he's a real jerk."
Perd Hapley,"Harsh words, but this reporter does love those tshirt cannons."
Perd Hapley,"Now, Jen, what are your thoughts about all of this?"
Jennifer Barkley,This is not a time for politics.
Jennifer Barkley,I am calling on Leslie Knope to cancel all of her campaign events out of respect for the Newport family.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anything else would be a classless move, on par with spraypainting nipples on the Lincoln memorial."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, emergency meeting."
Leslie Knope,I need everyone to gather around me in order of how much I trust them.
Leslie Knope,Here's the situation.
Leslie Knope,A man has died.
Leslie Knope,"But that man is 98 years old, and he's an awful man."
Leslie Knope,"However, he is a man, and he died."
Ann Perkins,"Also, you called the dead man a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"However, he was a jerk."
Leslie Knope,"He put a lot of people out of work, he had tons of mistresses, he polluted this town."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, it's unfortunate, but the stakes are too high."
Ben Wyatt,We can't just stop campaigning.
Ben Wyatt,"We stop, we lose."
Leslie Knope,"Good answer, great body."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, try to beat what he said."
Ann Perkins,I'm not going to beat him.
Leslie Knope,Not with that attitude.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine."
Ann Perkins,I think you should stop.
Ann Perkins,At least until you apologize to Bobby in person.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,"I wasn't listening, but I strongly disagree with Ann."
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,If the if the guy if Okay.
Chris Traeger,I absolutely think that we should keep campaigning.
Chris Traeger,"The worst possible thing we could do would be to stop, because if the campaign stops, we all stop."
Chris Traeger,And stopping is certain death.
Chris Traeger,Who wants a panini?
Chris Traeger,Anyone?
Chris Traeger,Everyone?
Chris Traeger,I'm going to say everyone.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Ann Perkins,"All right, Leslie, what's your call?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, there is nothing harder in the entire world than saying no to your beautiful face."
Leslie Knope,But I'm going to.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,We're going to keep campaigning.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, but we're going to do it in a classy and respectful way to get Ann off of our backs."
Leslie Knope,"What's next on the ""schedge?"""
Donna Meagle,"If you let Newport have the vans, they just sit there in a lot."
Donna Meagle,"If you let us have the vans, they drive around town all day."
Donna Meagle,Free publicity.
Donna Meagle,Everyone will see your logo.
Donna Meagle,Which is you all pressed up on some chick with huge cans.
Bill,Yeah.
Bill,It was a hell of a day.
Bill,People need to know about it.
BIll,And I don't need free publicity.
Bill,I can just pay for it.
Bill,"With my $10,000."
Tom Haverford,"Look, I ain't gonna try to play a player."
Tom Haverford,You're trying to get beaucoup bucks just like the rest of us.
Tom Haverford,So how about this?
Tom Haverford,I have a business idea for a gourmet alcoholic yogurt.
Tom Haverford,I call it Yogurt platinum.
Tom Haverford,I'll let you in on the ground floor.
Tom Haverford,"And let me tell you, it's going to be worth way more than 10 grand."
Bill,"Yeah, but now that I know your bad idea, I can start the company myself."
Bill,"With my $10,000."
Tom Haverford,"No, you can't do that!"
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Ron Swanson,"Tom, Donna, could you please give us a moment?"
Ron Swanson,"I'd like to talk to Bill, man to man."
Tom Haverford,He's gonna steal yogurt platinum.
Bill,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,"""We're all your friends,"" said Mr."
Leslie Knope,bacon.
Leslie Knope,"""Welcome home."
Leslie Knope,""" The end."
Leslie Knope,"And that is Groffle, the awful Waffle, a book that I wrote and published on behalf of my education initiative."
Leslie Knope,Any questions?
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Extra,How did Groffle cross the syrup river?
Extra,And why did you call Mr.
Extra,Newport a jerk?
Leslie Knope,"Ah well, I should not have called Nick Newport a jerk, because we need to be respectful of all dead people."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, not Stalin or Hitler, but I'm not calling Nick Newport Hitler."
Extra,Ms.
Extra,"Knope, I have a followup to what I'm now deciding to call ""jerkgate."""
Extra,Are there any other deceased members of Bobby Newport's family you'd like to attack?
Extra,And quit ducking the waffle question.
Extra,Did Groffle use a boat of some kind?
Ben Wyatt,"All right, that's all the questions for now."
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, everybody."
Extra,Are we to assume that he swam across the syrup river?
Extra,Ms.
Extra,Knope!
Leslie Knope,I'm never going to get away from these Nick Newport questions.
Ann Perkins,It's obvious what you need to do.
Ann Perkins,You have to apologize to Bobby and stop campaigning.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,"We go to Bobby Newport, you apologize"
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"And then we leak the details to the press, which restores your reputation and buys us enough time  to finish the bus tour."
Leslie Knope,Nice.
Ann Perkins,"No, that's not a real apology."
Ann Perkins,It's just sneaky.
Ann Perkins,I don't like it.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, for once, this is not about you."
Leslie Knope,A man is dead.
Ron Swanson,"Look, friend, I respect your slavish devotion to the free market, but you can't welch on a contract."
Ron Swanson,"Where I come from, a man's word is sacred."
Bill,"Okay, what's your stance on pinky swears, George Washington?"
BIll,I'm taking the money.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I'll match it.
Ron Swanson,"I'll give you $10,000 for the vans."
Ron Swanson,Deal?
BIll,No.
BIll,Price has gone up.
BIll,"Now it's $12,000."
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,Why?
BIll,"Look, I own a fleet of 22 crappy white vans, and for some reason there's a massive bidding war going on over them."
Bill,"Now for a guy whose only assets are 22 crappy white vans, it's pretty much a dream scenario, so I'm just going to ride this out, see where it takes me."
Bill,"And now it's 15,000."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I talked Newport's people into giving us ten minutes alone with Bobby, so we get in there, we apologize, and then we get back on the campaign trail."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, how do we leak this to the press?"
Leslie Knope,"Do we, like, release a statement?"
Leslie Knope,Do we call somebody?
Ann Perkins,"Um, I don't think that's going to be a problem."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why are there so many people here?"
Ben Wyatt,It's a trap.
Ben Wyatt,It's a trap!
Ben Wyatt,We got to get out of here.
Leslie Knope,Turn around!
Ben Wyatt,Turn around!
Jennifer Barkley,This is a time of solemnity and remembrance.
Jennifer Barkley,"This is not a time for politic Oh, wow."
Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is driving her campaign bus through a memorial service.
Ben Wyatt,Back it up!
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, back up!"
Leslie Knope,Back it up!
Jennifer Barkley,Just when we thought she couldn't stoop any lower.
Jennifer Barkley,Just oh!
Jennifer Barkley,Oh!
Jennifer Barkley,Aah!
Ben Wyatt,Uh  Go forward!
Ben Wyatt,Go forward!
Leslie Knope,Go forward!
Jennifer Barkley,I feel like he's dying all over again.
Chris Traeger,Stop it!
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Hi Sorry, are we late?"
Jennifer Barkley,"So I I hate to bring this up again, but I just want to make sure that I'm going to get paid."
Jennifer Barkley,It was a handshake agreement with Mr.
Jennifer Barkley,Newport.
Jennifer Barkley,It was for a lot of money.
Jennifer Barkley,"Anyway, you can wiretransfer it."
Jennifer Barkley,Sorry for your loss.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you turned this situation into a political sideshow.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, come on, you guys were only going to apologize for the press."
Leslie Knope,"No way, that's not us."
Leslie Knope,You don't know us at all.
Ben Wyatt,It's rude to say it.
Leslie Knope,We wouldn't even think it.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's a ridiculous claim."
Leslie Knope,"We brought a ""sorry for your loss"" fruit basket for Bobby."
Leslie Knope,And it is very classy.
Leslie Knope,"No melon, no apples."
Jennifer Barkley,"You were going to use us, and we just turned the tables on you."
Jennifer Barkley,'Cause I'm smarter and faster.
Jennifer Barkley,That is not a judgment.
Jennifer Barkley,That's just a fact.
Jennifer Barkley,"We're both just doing whatever it takes to win, right?"
Jennifer Barkley,I love polka dots.
Jennifer Barkley,It's so cute.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, I should have seen this coming."
Ben Wyatt,And we should not have driven here on a bus with your face on it.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's my fault."
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,Jen is right.
Leslie Knope,I'm no better than her.
Ann Perkins,"No, Leslie, yes, you are."
Ann Perkins,All you need to do is stop the machine for a second and go apologize to Bobby.
Ann Perkins,Alone without cameras.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Ann, but where was that advice six hours ago?"
Ann Perkins,That's not going to work.
Leslie Knope,I had to try.
Chris Traeger,April.
Chris Traeger,"I just got Champion his dog food, cleaned your house, filed that paperwork you're officially April Ludgate Dwyer, installed a smoke detector, and now I'm back."
Chris Traeger,What's next?
April Ludgate,"Nothing, Chris."
April Ludgate,Just sit down somewhere and stop bothering me.
Chris Traeger,I can't.
Chris Traeger,I've had a very tough year.
Chris Traeger,I can't stop thinking about Ann and Millicent.
Chris Traeger,"And if I'm alone with my thoughts, I go to a dark place."
April Ludgate,"Okay, first of all, dark places are awesome."
April Ludgate,"Secondly, Ann is kind of lame, so way to dodge a bullet."
April Ludgate,"And Millicent is Jerry's daughter, so two bullets."
April Ludgate,And you're not alone.
April Ludgate,You've got lots of friends.
April Ludgate,Somewhere.
April Ludgate,I assume.
April Ludgate,You're going to be just fine.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,You're right.
Chris Traeger,I'll be fine.
Chris Traeger,I'm not fine.
Chris Traeger,It didn't work.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Bobby."
Bobby Newport,"Oh, hi."
Bobby Newport,Want to play bowling?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you play with the real one?
Bobby Newport,Oh.
Bobby Newport,I like this one better.
Bobby Newport,The little guy looks like me.
Bobby Newport,See?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can we talk for a second?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I just wanted to say I'm really sorry your dad died, and I'm really, really sorry I called him a jerk."
Bobby Newport,That's okay.
Bobby Newport,"He was, like, a million years old."
Bobby Newport,And he was kind of a jerk.
Bobby Newport,"The only reason I did this campaign was to impress him, and he couldn't have cared less."
Leslie Knope,"You know, my mom was a great athlete when she was a kid."
Leslie Knope,"So in junior high, I joined the track team to impress her, even though I hated it."
Leslie Knope,"And at the end of the year, I ran the 5,000 meters in this huge track event."
Leslie Knope,And I finished dead last.
Leslie Knope,And I thought that she was going to be really disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,But she wasn't.
Leslie Knope,"She ran up to me, and she wrapped me up in this big hug, and she told me she had never been more proud of me."
Bobby Newport,"Thanks, Leslie."
Bobby Newport,That's a great story.
Bobby Newport,"I'm not 100% sure I get the point, but"
Leslie Knope,"You finished this race, Bobby."
Leslie Knope," The campaign is over, and you finished."
Leslie Knope," Win or lose, I bet you anything that your dad was proud of you."
Bobby Newport, Now I get it.
Leslie Knope, There you go.
Bobby Newport, Your mom and my dad are both dicks.
Tom Haverford," There's no vans within 50 miles, and, for some reason, no one wants to lend me $10,000."
Ron Swanson," Even if we had the dough, that bunco artist would just demand more, trust me."
Tom Haverford, Don't move.
Tom Haverford, Let's just stay here.
Tom Haverford," For like an hour, and not let him out."
Donna Meagle, This isn't right.
Donna Meagle, Our girl's worked hard.
Donna Meagle, We're so close.
Donna Meagle, I know he didn't just hit my baby!
Bill,"Hey! What the hell, guys? Move!"
Donna Meagle, All right.
Donna Meagle, Y'all got your seat belts on? Oh! 
Donna Meagle,Did you see that? That son of a bitch just rear-ended me.
Tom Haverford, Am I dead?
Bill,What the hell?
Donna Meagle,"Exactly, Bill."
Donna Meagle, What the hell? You just rear-ended me.
BIll, That is not what happened.
Donna Meagle,But I got witnesses.
Tom Haverford, Yeah.
Tom Haverford," It went down exactly the way my girl said it did, you mean, bald man."
Bill," Hey, what about you, Mr."
BIll," ""A man's word is sacred""?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, it is, but you're an ass [Bleep]."
Donna Meagle, So we can settle this now.
Donna Meagle, I will accept payment in van rentals.
Bill, Gah!
Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's go to the video again."
Andy Dwyer," Sweet kick, Leslie exits the building, and then you get hit."
Andy Dwyer, What else do we know?
Andy Dwyer,"We know that Leslie was about 15 feet in front of you, so clearly the assailant has terrible aim."
Jerry Gergich, Mm-hmm.
Andy Dwyer, Or Leslie wasn't the target.
Jerry Gergich," Well, who then?"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, that's permanent marker."
Andy Dwyer," Go find Ben, get a list of everyone he's ever fired."
Andy Dwyer," Go, go! Macklin, you son of a bitch."
Bobby Newport, A lot of people have been asking me how I feel about everything that's happened today.
Bobby Newport," Well, let me tell you a little story."
Bobby Newport, My dad was this amazing athlete when he was a kid.
Bobby Newport," When I was in junior high, I started doing track just to impress him Even though I hated it."
Bobby Newport," At the end of the year, I entered the 5,000 meters."
Bobby Newport, And I won.
Bobby Newport, It was awesome.
Bobby Newport," My dad wrapped me in a big hug, said he was proud of me."
Bobby Newport, That's just a great story that happened between me and my dad and nobody else.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, we're dead."
Ben Wyatt,It's over.
Leslie Knope,That's my story.
Bobby Newport," Before I go, I want to bring up a special guest."
Bobby Newport, Somebody who's been very supportive and mega cool today.
Bobby Newport, Leslie Knope.
Bobby Newport, Will you come up here?
Leslie Knope,What?
Bobby Newport,"Come on, come up here."
Ben Wyatt,"Go, go, go, go, go."
Bobby Newport,"You know, Leslie's been getting a lot of heat today, but I want you all to know that we talked person-to-person, and she's really great."
Bobby Newport, People should stop being so mean to her.
Bobby Newport," In fact, if you don't vote for me tomorrow, you should vote for her, because she's super, super awesome lady."
Bobby Newport," Leslie, we did it!"
Bobby Newport,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,Maybe we're not dead.
Jennifer Barkley," Chris, right? Hi, I'm Jen."
Chris Traeger, Hello.
Jennifer Barkley," You know, there are 30 bedrooms in this house. Bobby's in one, there's a dead guy in another, the rest are free."
Jennifer Barkley, What do you say?
Chris Traeger,Oh! That is very flattering.
Chris Traeger, But you're the opposition campaign manager.
Chris Traeger,I couldn't do that to Leslie.
Jennifer Barkley," Oh, for God's sake, Chris."
Jennifer Barkley, This campaign is over.
Jennifer Barkley, My job is done and so is yours.
Jennifer Barkley, It's just sex.
Jennifer Barkley, I'm very good at it.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Jennifer Barkley,Great! Let's do it.
Jennifer Barkley," Haven't got all day, honey."
Andy Dwyer, Sewage Joe.
Andy Dwyer," Ben Wyatt fired you for sending pictures of your penis to everyone, and you've come here to ""pie"" him."
Joe From Sewage, Little twerp has it coming.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, dude, I dare you."
Andy Dwyer, Please.
Andy Dwyer, Give me one reason to take you down.
Andy Dwyer," I would love nothing more Oh, [Bleep]."
Andy Dwyer," Ben, sorry."
Extra," All right, let's go."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, I did it!"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt, Great job.

Extra,I will certify the results after all the precints have reported.
Extra,A final tally within 1% would trigger an automatic recount.
Extra,"In the event of an exact tie, the seat is awarded to the male candidate, and the female candidate is put in jail."
Leslie Knope,"Once again, I have to object."
Extra,"I don't think it would hold up in court, but it is city law."
Extra,Any questions?
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, actually."
Ben Wyatt,At the 11th hour the Newports are trying to install these voting machines at several precincts around town.
Ben Wyatt,Watch what happens when I vote for Bobby Newport.
Extra,Good choice.
Extra,Enjoy a voucher for a complimentary Sweetums candy bar.
Jennifer Barkley,Shouldn't we be rewarding our citizens for voting?
Leslie Knope,"I'm never against anyone getting a candy bar, but watch what happens when you vote for me."
Extra,Are you sure?
Extra,Take a second and think it over.
Leslie Knope,Then you have to press it again.
Extra,"To cancel your vote and select someone better, press the Sweetums logo."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm sorry.
Jennifer Barkley,I just don't see the problem.
Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport and I are separated by a razor thin margin.
Leslie Knope,Could go either way.
Leslie Knope,"I've only slept nine hours over the past four days, so I'm right on the verge of a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,This isn't a bagel.
Tom Haverford,Party starts at 7:00 in the historic Jermaine Jackson Ballroom at the Pawnee Supersuites.
Tom Haverford,"It is no longer ""A Pimps n' Hoes"" pajama party."
Tom Haverford,That idea was nixed by a certain uptight nerd who shall remain nameless.
Tom Haverford,"By 10:00, we should know if Leslie won the election, but more importantly, tonight, Ann and I are getting back together."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, right, because of the dream you had?"
Tom Haverford,Last night at approximately 2:30 A.M.
Tom Haverford,I woke up from a dream that felt so real that it had to be a premonition.
Tom Haverford,"Me, Drake, and the Tmobile girl were playing baccarat on a private jet."
Tom Haverford,"Ann Perkins walks up to me, and she says, ""Tommy, tomorrow night, I'm taking you back."
Tom Haverford,""" Then Blue Ivy Carter highfived me and gave me $40 million."
Tom Haverford,It was all so real.
Leslie Knope,The reason why Bobby and I are appearing together is to send the message that everyone should get out and vote no matter who they're voting for.
Bobby Newport,That's right.
Bobby Newport,Another awesome point by Leslie.
Bobby Newport,That's why I'm voting for you.
Bobby Newport,What's so funny?
Leslie Knope,They're laughing at your joke.
Bobby Newport,What joke?
Bobby Newport,I am voting for you.
Leslie Knope,You're not voting for yourself?
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, you can't vote for yourself, I don't think."
Bobby Newport,I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
Leslie Knope,Anything else?
Jennifer Barkley,"Hey, you did an unbelievable job on this campaign, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,My partners back in Washington think so too.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Leslie gets the credit."
Ben Wyatt,Not me.
Jennifer Barkley,Look.
Jennifer Barkley,"Your opponent is legendarily stupid and I phoned it in pretty hard, but you have a knack for this."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm running congressman Murray's reelection bid.
Jennifer Barkley,"Ohio, 19."
Jennifer Barkley,I need someone to coordinate out of D.C.
Jennifer Barkley,You want to do it?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that sounds great, but the Pacers called, and they're asking me to be their starting point guard."
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm being serious, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"What, you trust me with a congressional campaign?"
Ben Wyatt,Is this a trick?
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,This is a job offer.
Jennifer Barkley,Give me your answer soon.
Jennifer Barkley,I need you in Washington in two days.
Bobby Newport,Look at that thing.
Bobby Newport,What is that?
Leslie Knope,Don't touch it.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Can I ask your advice on something?
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Chris Traeger,"Recently in a moment of weakness, I had sex with Bobby Newport's campaign manager Jennifer Barkley."
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Several times.
Chris Traeger,And then several more times.
Chris Traeger,And then a couple more times.
Chris Traeger,And then one more time.
Ann Perkins,How long has this been going on?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, it was just last night."
Chris Traeger,"Now, I know it's a one night stand and that she's leaving town, but our ferocious sexual decathlon did radically improve my mood."
Chris Traeger,And I kind of like to see her again before she leaves.
Chris Traeger,Good idea?
Chris Traeger,Bad idea?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"I guess the campaign's over, so I suppose it couldn't hurt."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Got your message.
Andy Dwyer,Where are you?
April Ludgate,Under the table.
Andy Dwyer,Why are you hiding?
Andy Dwyer,Should I hide too?
Andy Dwyer,What's going on?
April Ludgate,"I was supposed to copy all the department files onto a thumb drive, and it kept freezing, and I got annoyed, and I don't know what happened, but all the files are gone on every computer."
April Ludgate,They're all gone.
April Ludgate,"Babe, they're all gone."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, okay."
Andy Dwyer,Calm down.
Andy Dwyer,"First of all, you did the right thing by hiding under this table."
Andy Dwyer,"Secondly, your man is here."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna take care of this for us.
Andy Dwyer,I've been playing Xbox for years.
Andy Dwyer,I'm really good at fixing it when it freezes.
Andy Dwyer,I know exactly what to do.
Andy Dwyer,Try it now.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I feel like I'm forgetting something.
Leslie Knope,What about my speeches?
Ben Wyatt,Finished both of them last night.
Ben Wyatt,"One if you win, one if you lose."
Leslie Knope,What if I tie?
Leslie Knope,"You need to write a tie speech for me, something about the poetic nature of democracy and how I'm going fight this thing from my prison cell"
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, relax."
Ben Wyatt,We're done.
Ben Wyatt,All that's left is the waiting.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Leslie Knope,What were you talking to Jen about?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I just yeah, nothing."
Ben Wyatt,She she's nothing.
Ben Wyatt,Nothing.
Ben Wyatt,It's nothing.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, what's a good place to buy jeans?"
Leslie Knope,You have plenty of jeans.
Leslie Knope,What were you talking about?
Ben Wyatt,Jen offered me a job working on a congressional campaign
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's amazing."
Ben Wyatt,In Washington.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Are you happy or angry?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,What did you say?
Leslie Knope,"Did you say, ""yes?"
Ben Wyatt,""" I haven't had a chance to think about it."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it sounds amazing, but you know, six months in Washington, D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"Away from you, but you know, we should talk about it."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,We'll just talk about it.
Leslie Knope,"You know, we'll mull it over, we'll look at it from every side."
Leslie Knope,"Et cetera, et cetera."
Leslie Knope,"Just I'm going to go vote, just fulfill a lifelong dream of mine and achieve one of my all time happiest moments real quick, and then we will talk about it."
Ben Wyatt,Cool.
Bobby Newport,"Leslie, I can't figure this thing out."
Bobby Newport,Can you help me?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, just hang on a second, Bobby."
Bobby Newport,"Ink all over my hands, and the pen thingy came off the chain."
Bobby Newport,I don't get it!
Perd Hapley,"The polls have just closed, and now we're getting results in the race for city council."
Perd Hapley,"With just 1% of the precincts reporting, adult film star Brandi Maxxxx has a commanding lead."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's it.
Leslie Knope,"It's not Bobby Newport who's going to beat me, it's Brandi Maxxxx, the porn star."
Leslie Knope,What is this?
Leslie Knope,Italy?
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know you're stressed out, and I figured you would be, so I took the liberty of arranging a fun little activity for us."
Leslie Knope,You did?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,"I've said this to you before, and I know it makes you uncomfortable"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"But you're thoughtful, and you're brilliant, and your ambiguous ethnic blend perfectly represents the dream of the American melting pot."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"Another, Dana, please and thank you."
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I handed out 1000 leaflets today."
Jerry Gergich,That is a personal best.
Jerry Gergich,Now I'm off to vote.
Ron Swanson,The polls are closed.
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no."
Jerry Gergich,I thought that they close at 8:00.
Ron Swanson,6
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, I didn't get to vote for Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God, what do I do?"
Ron Swanson,Nothing you can do.
Ron Swanson,Except hope Leslie doesn't lose by one vote.
Perd Hapley,and it's razor thin and getting razor thinner.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, boy."
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Chris Traeger,Jen Barkley.
Jennifer Barkley,Hey.
Jennifer Barkley,What are you doing here?
Jennifer Barkley,"That was fun last night, you old screamer."
Chris Traeger,There were moments that I didn't fully understand some of the physical shapes that we were making Mm.
Chris Traeger,But the sensations were amazing.
Chris Traeger,So I just went with it.
Jennifer Barkley,Great.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I thought that we could just talk before you left town if that's okay."
Jennifer Barkley,"No, but there's a supply room over there with a futon."
Chris Traeger,Great.
Jennifer Barkley,Not yet.
Jennifer Barkley,Just wait we're just getting supplies.
Jennifer Barkley,Anybody need anything?
Jennifer Barkley,"Pushpins okay, good."
Andy Dwyer,Please hurry.
Andy Dwyer,I told her it's a matter of life and death.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, Donna's been here forever."
Andy Dwyer,She's going to know what to do.
April Ludgate,What if she doesn't?
April Ludgate,I could get fired.
April Ludgate,"Or even worse, Leslie might give me a lecture on responsibility again, I can't do it."
Andy Dwyer,"I'll tell you what, honey."
Andy Dwyer,Here's the deal.
Andy Dwyer,"You get fired, I'll quit."
Andy Dwyer,We'll leave together.
Andy Dwyer,I'm serious.
Andy Dwyer,Move to a new city.
Andy Dwyer,"Change our names, burn our fingertips off with acid, swap faces."
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,If we have to.
Ann Perkins,Good.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Nice.
Ann Perkins,Keep punching.
Leslie Knope,Did I hit your boob?
Ann Perkins,No.
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,Great form.
Ann Perkins,Maybe.
Ann Perkins,I have no idea actually.
Ann Perkins,I don't know what I'm doing.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,That was good.
Leslie Knope,I'm exhausted.
Leslie Knope,How long was that?
Ann Perkins,22 seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Boy, that's disappointing."
Ann Perkins,What are you going to do about Ben?
Leslie Knope,I just I've been running for office the entire time we've been dating.
Leslie Knope,We're just about to get our lives back.
Leslie Knope,It would kill me if he left.
Ann Perkins,Then tell him that.
Ann Perkins,Go find him and tell him how you feel.
Ann Perkins,And then the two of you could work it out together.
Leslie Knope,"Election results, Ann."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, Ann, I can't read it."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, my hands."
Leslie Knope,"My hands, Ann."

Leslie Knope,Go another eight seconds.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm so tired."
Ben Wyatt,"Gin and tonic, please."
Ron Swanson,"Belay that order, Dana."
Ron Swanson,"Lagavulin, neat."
Ron Swanson,Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.
Ron Swanson,"What's on your mind, son?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Jen Barkley offered me a job in Washington."
Ben Wyatt,"A great job, but I think Leslie wants me to stay."
Ben Wyatt,What would you do?
Ron Swanson,"Well, I've never been one for meeting new people or doing new things or eating new types of food or traveling outside of southern Indiana."
Ron Swanson,"I've had the same haircut since 1978, and I've driven the same car since 1991."
Ron Swanson,I've used the same wooden comb for three decades.
Ron Swanson,I have one bowl.
Ron Swanson,I still get my milk delivered by horse.
Ben Wyatt,You do?
Ron Swanson,But you and Leslie like to hold hands and jump off of cliffs together into the great unknown.
Ron Swanson,You two have a good relationship.
Ron Swanson,"I don't personally know what that's like, but I'm given to understand that means you're going to land on your feet."
Ben Wyatt,So you really want things to just stay exactly the same?
Ben Wyatt,"But if Leslie wins, you get my old job, assistant city manager, right?"
Ron Swanson,Seems that way.
Ben Wyatt,Then good luck to the both of us.
Ben Wyatt,Heyuh!
Ben Wyatt,Hmm!
Perd Hapley,I have an update that contains new information.
Perd Hapley,"With 74% of the precincts reporting, Leslie Knope is now winning by 192 votes."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank God."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, lord, please, please."
Jerry Gergich,Let her win.
Jerry Gergich,"Please, lord."
Jerry Gergich,"Please, lord, let her win."
Jerry Gergich,Please let her win.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to say this.
Leslie Knope,And I realize this after speaking with my best friend and relationship advisor Ann Perkins from the department of health.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, I know Ann."
Leslie Knope,I don't want you to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope,"I know it's an amazing opportunity, but in just a few minutes, all this craziness is going to be over, and I just want to have dinner with you."
Leslie Knope,Like normal people.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, then I won't go."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Easy.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I was on the fence about it anyway."
Ben Wyatt,"Washington's really far away, and I don't know if I want to work with Jen."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this just seals the deal."
Ben Wyatt,I'll stay.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank God."
Leslie Knope,What a relief.
Ann Perkins,Guys.
Perd Hapley,"It's been neck in neck, too close to call all night, but now we're ready to make a call in the race for city council."
Perd Hapley,Bobby Newport
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Perd Hapley,Scion of the Sweetums candy empire and amateur gokart champion has won the race.
Ben Wyatt,Why are you laughing?
Leslie Knope,Because my dream is dead.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, [Bleep]."
Ben Wyatt,Recount!
Ben Wyatt,There's a recount.
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, come on."
Jennifer Barkley,It's over.
Jennifer Barkley,Just concede.
Ben Wyatt,Newport won by 21 votes.
Ben Wyatt,That's well within the margin for a recount.
Jennifer Barkley,Please don't do this.
Jennifer Barkley,I really want to get out of here.
Jennifer Barkley,How about this why don't I make you guys a deal?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, there's no deal in the world that we would ever possibly "
Jennifer Barkley,I'll give you Joe Biden's home phone number.
Leslie Knope,"Now, hang on."
Leslie Knope,That's interesting.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, you're not thinking clearly."
Ben Wyatt,Mr.
Ben Wyatt,"Commissioner, the recount has to start immediately."
Ben Wyatt,It's the law.
Ben Wyatt,Now I'm not leaving until you make the call.
Extra,"He's right, Ms."
Extra,Barkley.
Extra,It'll start right away.
Extra,Keep your phones on.
Jennifer Barkley,Terrence!
Jennifer Barkley,I just want to go home.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, any news?"
Ben Wyatt,"They said the recount could take two hours, but who knows."
Tom Haverford,"Man, this is stressful."
Tom Haverford,I picked the wrong week to do a juice cleanse.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I think Leslie should say something to the troops just to get everyone's spirits up."
Ben Wyatt,Where is she?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,She's not answering her phone.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,No one knows where she is?
Ron Swanson,That's a nice chair.
Ron Swanson,"Corinthian leather, solid mahogany frame with what I believe are handcut mortise and tenon joints pinned with oak."
Leslie Knope,I was really looking forward to sitting in it.
Leslie Knope,Figured this might be my last chance.
Ron Swanson,You don't know that.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, for the last six months, my friends have worked so hard."
Leslie Knope,"Every five minute coffee break at work, every night, every weekend, every spare moment of their lives, they gave to me."
Leslie Knope,"If I lose, I'll never forgive myself."
Leslie Knope,You deserve to win.
Ron Swanson,We didn't volunteer to help you because we wanted to wrap ourselves in personal glory.
Ron Swanson,We did it because we care about you.
Ron Swanson,"You had a dream, and we wanted to support your dream."
Ron Swanson,That's what you do when you care about someone.
Ron Swanson,"You support them, win, lose, or draw."
Ron Swanson,Let's go back to the party.
Ron Swanson,You drive.
Ron Swanson,I've had 11 whiskeys.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,That's good on places to live.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go back to dream jobs.
Andy Dwyer,"If we had to start a new life, I have Detective, FBI agent, policeman, CIA agent."
Andy Dwyer,So we need more for you.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I "
Andy Dwyer, It's fun.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm trying to help you take your mind off of this horrible mistake you made deleting all these files, probably the worst thing to ever happen in Parks and Rec history."
Andy Dwyer,"You will certainly get fired, and I'm trying to help."
April Ludgate,God.
Andy Dwyer,"So dream jobs, go."
Andy Dwyer,"Dream big, kid!"
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"Uh, dental hygienist who's also a medium, so I can clean people's teeth and tell them when they're going to die."
Andy Dwyer,That's brilliant.
Donna Meagle,Let's make this fast.
Donna Meagle,I almost made it with Councilman Howser before you interrupted us.
Donna Meagle,Which files did you delete?
April Ludgate,All of them.
April Ludgate,"I just put the stupid flash drive in, and then I tried to drag everything over, and"
Donna Meagle,Fixed it.
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,How?
Donna Meagle,Jerry accidentally deletes things all the time.
Donna Meagle,"Ten years ago, I installed my own secret backup."
April Ludgate,"You saved us, Donna."
Donna Meagle,Oh.
April Ludgate,I love you.
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Donna Meagle,"Bring it in, boy."
Ben Wyatt,There you are.
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,We're going to get the final results any minute.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Do you have both my speeches?
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,You seem calmer than I expected you'd be.
Leslie Knope,I got you something.
Leslie Knope,Let me open it for you.
Leslie Knope,You have to go to Washington.
Ben Wyatt,I told you I'm turning it down.
Leslie Knope,I was being selfish.
Leslie Knope,You put your whole life on hold for me.
Leslie Knope,The very least I can do is try to return the favor.
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure about this?
Leslie Knope,We can make it work.
Leslie Knope,"I will visit you, then you come visit me."
Leslie Knope,And then I go visit you again.
Leslie Knope,And then we make out in the Lincoln bedroom And the Jefferson Memorial and the Supreme Court gallery.
Leslie Knope,We'll do it all over Washington.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Where did you get a Washington Monument figurine at midnight on a Tuesday?
Leslie Knope,From my office.
Leslie Knope,"I have, like, 50 of them."
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ann Perkins,The recount's over.
Ann Perkins,They just called the race.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,It's still 21 votes.
Ann Perkins,But you won.
Ann Perkins,"You won, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,You won by 21 votes.
Ann Perkins,It's confirmed.
Ann Perkins,It's over.
Ann Perkins,You won.
Leslie Knope,"That was really sneaky, Ann."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,I couldn't resist.
Bobby Newport,"Honestly, I've never been more relieved in my entire life."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't ruin it.
Jerry Gergich,"I thought I ruined it, but I didn't ruin it."
Tom Haverford,You're kind of ruining it now.
Jennifer Barkley,Great.
Jennifer Barkley, That is great news.
Jennifer Barkley, I'm going to see you in D.C.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I guess you will."
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Jennifer Barkley," Oh, damn it."
Jennifer Barkley, Didn't get a chance to say good-bye to Chris.
Ann Perkins," Oh, he's just right over there."
Jennifer Barkley, Eh.
Jennifer Barkley, He seems really busy.
Jennifer Barkley," Anyway, would you tell him I said good-bye? Great! Thank you."
Jennifer Barkley, Sorry we didn't get a chance to meet.
Ann Perkins,I'm Ann.
Jennifer Barkley,That doesn't matter.
Jennifer Barkley, I'm leaving.
Chris Traeger," Congratulations, Mr."
Chris Traeger, Assistant City Manager.
Ron Swanson," I'm very grateful, Chris, but I think I'm going to turn down the job."
Chris Traeger, Really? Why?
Ron Swanson,I like where I am.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Uh-oh, uh-oh."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Did someone just talk about a job opening? Because guess who's got two thumbs and was just cleared from insurance fraud?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," This guy, you know?  Got off on a technicality  What's the gig? I'm in."
Chris Traeger, There's no job for you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Smart move.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Go with your gut.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, All right? I'll talk to you guys soon.
Ben Wyatt," Your victory speech, Councilwoman Knope."
Leslie Knope," Some day, when I'm more emotionally stable, I want to read the concession speech you wrote for me."
Ben Wyatt, I never wrote it.
Ann Perkins, And I know all of you know how hard she worked to get here.
Ann Perkins," She is the next city councilwoman from the great city of Pawnee, ladies and gentlemen, my best friend in the world, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope," The idea behind this campaign was a simple one: That with hard work and positivity, a group of people can make a difference during my term as your city councilor Thank you."
Leslie Knope, I want to focus on your hopes and not your fears.
Leslie Knope, I want to solve problems instead of creating friction.
Leslie Knope, And I will work hard every hour of every day to make Pawnee a better place to live because I love this city.
Leslie Knope," And I know firsthand, how very special the people of this city are."
Leslie Knope," I owe this victory, all of it, to my friends and my supporters."
Leslie Knope, No one achieves anything alone.
Leslie Knope, So let's embark on a new journey together.
Leslie Knope, Let's break out a map.
Leslie Knope," Not the old, out-of-date one that shows where we've been, but a crisp new one that shows where we might go."
Leslie Knope, Let's embark on a new journey together and see where it takes us.
Ann Perkins,"  Tommy! This party was amazing, you're amazing."
Ann Perkins," You are ridiculous, but I like you, and I think that we should date, all of it."
Ann Perkins, Let's do it.
Ann Perkins, Let's date.
Tom Haverford, This is my dream.
Tom Haverford, Nostra-Thomas is happening.

Andy Dwyer, Great year.
Andy Dwyer, Hot wife.
Andy Dwyer, Jackpot.
Andy Dwyer," Good job, me."
April Ludgate," Oh, my God."
April Ludgate, Babe.
April Ludgate, You know what? Almost everything you wrote on that board as a dream job was some type of police officer.
Andy Dwyer, Yeah.
Andy Dwyer, You ready to go?
April Ludgate," No, listen to me."
Andy Dwyer,Mm-hmm.
April Ludgate,"How does this sound? ""Officer Dwyer, Pawnee PD."""
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we're going to JJ's for victory waffles, and then we're staying up all night talking about our lives and our feelings."
Leslie Knope, Nonnegotiable.
Leslie Knope," Let's go! City council, bitches!"
Ron Swanson,Jerry forgot to vote.

Leslie Knope,"Washington, D.C."
Leslie Knope,"Take a deep breath, Andy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you can practically smell the bills becoming laws."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You can taste the sweet sugar of bureaucracy at work.
Andy Dwyer,That building looks like a boob.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, it's not."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, I know."
Andy Dwyer,It's the White House.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's the Capitol.
Leslie Knope,"My amazing lover, Ben Wyatt, is here working on a congressional campaign."
Leslie Knope,And he took April with him as his intern.
Leslie Knope,"I'm here to visit, but I am also here to work, because I have a very important meeting where I am going to try to get federal funding so we can clean up the Pawnee river."
Leslie Knope,It's a bit of a fixer upper.
Leslie Knope,"Romantic reunions, government meetings, selfguided museum tours I mean, am I living the dream?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Did I also just walk past a food truck and buy myself a waffle sundae?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Now take out your guidebook.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I didn't bring a guidebook."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I brought you one."
Andy Dwyer,You did?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Now throw it away, 'cause Leslie Knope is your guidebook."
Leslie Knope,I didn't I didn't mean literally.
Leslie Knope,There were some notes in it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, grab the book, and let's hit the National Mall."
Andy Dwyer,There's a mall?
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,I need to get some flipflops.
Donna Meagle,Why are we having a conference room meeting?
Donna Meagle,Leslie's gone.
Chris Traeger,"Ron has taken initiative, and he is leading the meeting."
Ron Swanson,He's not joking.
Ron Swanson,I wanted to let you all know that I will be throwing the annual Parks Department employee appreciation barbecue.
Donna Meagle,You're going to throw the Leslie Knope Employment Enjoyment Summerslam Grill Jam Funsplosion?
Ron Swanson,That's right.
Tom Haverford,"You are gonna oversee the Popsicle eating contest, the slip'n slideathon, the watermelon carving, the gazpacho off, and star in a one woman show about parks rules and regulations?"
Jerry Gergich,"""Parks and Dolls."""
Jerry Gergich,"I got your park right here, its name is Ramsett Park."
Ann Perkins,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Tom Haverford,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Donna Meagle,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Jerry Gergich,and its gates are open from dawn till dark.
Ron Swanson,"I am not doing any of that, which is the point."
Ron Swanson,Every summer Leslie throws a barbecue to thank the Parks and Maintenance staff.
Ron Swanson,It's horrifying.
Ron Swanson,"Barbecues should be about one thing good, shared meat."
Ron Swanson,There will be no froofy desserts.
Ron Swanson,There will be no giant soap bubble guns.
Ron Swanson,There will be no adult men in costumes.
Ron Swanson,"And most of all, there will be no [Bleep] vegetables."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Ron, can we at least have corn on the cob?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"""In this temple, ""As in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever."""
Leslie Knope,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever seen any of the National Treasure movies?
Andy Dwyer,Everything in this city is a clue.
Leslie Knope,Nothing in that movie is accurate.
Andy Dwyer,Aha!
Andy Dwyer,A clue!
Andy Dwyer,Check it out.
Leslie Knope,I think that's just gum.
Andy Dwyer,How do I know this isn't a treasure map just waiting to be unfurled?
Leslie Knope,Because it's gum.
Andy Dwyer,That's gum.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So you can see that the color changes about a third of the way up, and it's when construction was actually halted on the monument"
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, this is a really cool penis, but Ben and April are meeting us at the Smithsonian in 10 minutes."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk on the way.
Leslie Knope,"1776, a nation is born."
Andy Dwyer,Which nation?
Chris Traeger,"I offered Ron a job last month, and he turned me down."
Chris Traeger,And it literally broke my heart.
Chris Traeger,But now I see that this is truly where he belongs.
Chris Traeger,"Way to be, Ron!"
Chris Traeger,"You're really getting it done, man!"
Chris Traeger,He can't hear me.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, let's begin the barbecue."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, hey, little guy."
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,"Everyone, meet your meat."
Jerry Gergich, No!
Donna Meagle, No!
Tom Haverford, No!
Ann Perkins, No!
Tom Haverford,Why are you doing this to us?
Ron Swanson,"Well, in my opinion, not enough people have looked their dinner in the eyes and considered the circle of life."
Ron Swanson,This is your dinner.
Ron Swanson,His name is Tom.
Donna Meagle,Burn.
Ron Swanson,Seriously?
Ron Swanson,"I understand that it's hilarious, but that is his given, Christian name."
Ron Swanson,Tom is very smart and incredibly loyal.
Ron Swanson,He's basically a dog.
Ron Swanson,"A dog we're going to cook, chew, and swallow."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, there's kids around here."
Ron Swanson,Good point.
Ron Swanson,Which one of you youngsters wants to help me drain the blood from this animal?
Ron Swanson,"If you do a good job, I'll give you the bladder."
Ron Swanson,You can blow it up for a fun play ball.
Extra,"Hey, Ron."
Extra,"You're not going to slaughter that pig here, are you?"
Ron Swanson,Not to worry.
Ron Swanson,I have a permit.
Extra,"This just says, ""I can do what I want."""
Ron Swanson,"I am the director of the Parks Department, and this is a park."
Extra,It's not a Parks thing.
Ron Swanson,"It's against, like, three laws and a dozen health codes."
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Barbecue is postponed until I can go pick up some meat from the Food 'n' Stuff.
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Tom."
Ron Swanson,"No, pig Tom."
Leslie Knope,So I want to see the history of the girl scouts and then Lincoln's pocket watch and the First Ladies exhibit and everything I want to see everything.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, get down from there."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,Is this the train from Back to the Future 3?
Andy Dwyer,Get down from there.
Andy Dwyer,I think it is.
Extra,"Hey, buddy."
Extra,"Come on down from there for me, please."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you protect our nation's history, and you're a hero."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, a hero with something to hide, like probably a treasure map."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey."
Leslie Knope,It's so good to see you.
Ben Wyatt,It's so great to see you too.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, uh, guys, let's motor."

Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"You look great, April."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, hon."
Ben Wyatt,I actually have to go too.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could sightsee together.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"I have, like, 1,000 meetings."
Ben Wyatt,But I just wanted to come wish you luck before your presentation.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, but you know what you should see while you're here is George Washington's fare"
Leslie Knope,Farewell address candle stand.
Leslie Knope,That was the first thing I was going to see.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love you so much."
Ben Wyatt,"Come to my office as soon as you're done, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And it was nice to see you again.
Ben Wyatt,Are you talking to my butt?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Donna Meagle,Where is Swanson?
Tom Haverford,"Man, I'm hungry."
Tom Haverford,My legs are tired.
Tom Haverford,It feels like I just exercised.
Jerry Gergich,Just sit on the ground.
Tom Haverford,"No, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"It's dirty, and I'm wearing my summer linens."
Ann Perkins,"God, you're such a baby."
Ann Perkins,"Look, I brought a picnic blanket from your house."
Tom Haverford,That's not a picnic blanket.
Tom Haverford,That's a Merino wool throw for my Eames chair!
Donna Meagle,Uhoh.
Donna Meagle,Do I sense trouble in the Haverford Perkins household?
Tom Haverford,"No such luck, Donna."
Tom Haverford,"Ann and Tom, aka Haverkins, are stronger than ever."
Tom Haverford,Everyone said it wouldn't last.
Ann Perkins,And it didn't.
Ann Perkins,Shocking that our drunken plan to move in together wasn't a success.
Tom Haverford,Let's move in together.
Ann Perkins,Totally.
Tom Haverford,"No takebacks when we sober up, though, partner."
Ann Perkins,"No takebacks, partner."
Ann Perkins,"After the first day, we realized we had made a huge mistake."
Tom Haverford,Huge.
Ann Perkins,"However, everyone was being so smug about it, saying there's no way it would last, so we're pretending to still be together."
Ann Perkins,"That way, no one gets the satisfaction of being right, even though they are, but still."
Tom Haverford,"More importantly, I bet Donna 1,000 dollars that we'd be together for another month."
Tom Haverford,I can't stress this enough.
Tom Haverford,"If she finds out that we broke up, I'll go bankrupt."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Food.
Ann Perkins,Food.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I am returned."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"Not so fast, Shirley."
Ron Swanson,"I just have to thaw the meat, season it, and grill it up."
Ron Swanson,So it's going to be a few hours.
Tom Haverford,"No, Ron."
Tom Haverford,My tummy's rumbling.
Tom Haverford,It's scary.
Tom Haverford,Tommy's got the tumrums.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, Chris Traeger feelings update I'm now feeling that your guests are getting a little antsy."
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,I'll skip a few steps and speed things up.
Chris Traeger,There you go.
Jerry Gergich,Is there at least something to drink?
Ron Swanson,There's beer in the cooler.
Chris Traeger,What about for the children?
Ron Swanson,You can get water from that water fountain and use it to water down the beer.
Ann Perkins,Why don't you just give the kids water?
Ron Swanson,I suppose you could do that.
Ron Swanson,"Now, would everyone please back off and just let me cook in peace?"
Ron Swanson,These people are soft.
Ron Swanson,They're grill virgins.
Ron Swanson,"But by the time this day is over, they'll have been taken by the grill and delicately and tenderly shown the ways of flavorful meat love."
Ron Swanson,Mmm The first time is so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Ben and I are a power couple, like the Roosevelts or the Clintons."
Leslie Knope,I've got a big meeting here.
Leslie Knope,Ben is off running a congressional campaign.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the only way we could be more awesome is if we had our own signature dance move."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,We do.
Leslie Knope,"Three, four."
Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,I have a 3:00 with Mr. Jepson.
Extra,What's this in reference to?
Leslie Knope,I'm here to present my application for the Federal Riverbed Preservation Grant.
Extra,Oh.
Extra,Most people just mail their applications in.
Leslie Knope, I'm not most people.
Extra,Mr. Jepson actually had to step out for the day.
Extra,You can just add your proposal to that pile there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,I was told I would have a facetoface meeting with him so I could make my case for my town.
Leslie Knope,Does he have office hours?
Extra,He's unavailable for the rest of the week.
Extra,But you can just add the proposal.
Extra,He'll get to it.
Leslie Knope,Oh Okay.
Leslie Knope,It's kind of a special application.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, you know, there's aa CD inside that, uh, plays the sound of a babbling river, and I was going to play that while I gave my presentation."
Leslie Knope,I was also going to show a DVD that had some images of frolicking river otters.
Extra,You know what?
Extra,II'll make sure he reads it.
Extra,What city is it for?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee.
Extra,"Is that Pawnee, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, or Texas?"
Leslie Knope,Indiana.
Extra,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,This is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,Look at this.
Andy Dwyer,This whole place is your office.
Ben Wyatt,Nope.
Ben Wyatt,This is my office.
April Ludgate,"Ben, you're fired."
April Ludgate,It's my office now.
Andy Dwyer,Boom.
Andy Dwyer,You heard the boss.
Andy Dwyer,"Scram, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,How'd it go?
Leslie Knope,"Um, I think okay."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I have a surprise for you."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, there's a swanky D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"Cocktail party at the HayAdams, and I got us all on the list."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at you."
Leslie Knope,You're a big shot.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, uh, Benjamin, how fancy is this party tonight?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, is this, like, a shorts or a pants kind of gala?"
Ben Wyatt,Pants.
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Could we just real quick stop at the nearest place that has free pants?
Chris Traeger,"I know that Ron doesn't want us to eat anything before the meat, but I smuggled in some candy."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, thank God."
Tom Haverford,I'm starving.
Tom Haverford,Raisins?
Chris Traeger,It's nature's candy.
Chris Traeger,"Now, they're basically grapes."
Chris Traeger,So remember to pace yourself.
Chris Traeger,I can't even follow my own advice.
Chris Traeger,It's too delicious.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Did you put glitter in the laundry detergent?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I'm experimenting with some new entrepreneurial ideas.
Tom Haverford,"That one's called ""Sparkle Suds."""
Tom Haverford,Dress loud.
Ann Perkins,Will you stop putting glitter in everything?
Ann Perkins,This morning you put glitter in the butter.
Tom Haverford,"""Disco Dairy."""
Tom Haverford,Spread the party.
Ann Perkins,"No, that's not a good idea."
Ann Perkins,That's terrible.
Tom Haverford,"Well, the target demographic isn't angry, middle aged nurses."
Ann Perkins,"Oh shh, stop it"
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Wait.
Donna Meagle,Hey.
Donna Meagle,I'm going to get in line for some food.
Donna Meagle,Y'all want anything?
Ann Perkins,We're good.
Ann Perkins,We're really good.
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,Just spending a little time with my baby girl.
Donna Meagle,Ew.
Ann Perkins,Get off me.
Andy Dwyer,"There's so much free food at this party, honey."
Andy Dwyer,I love politics.
Andy Dwyer,"Look, I made a shrimp claw."
April Ludgate,"I'm really proud of you, babe."
April Ludgate,Now put your used plate in my purse.
April Ludgate,I almost have a complete set.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,You're so smart.
Extra,"They say it will pass, but we'll only get $400 million instead of $900 million."
Ben Wyatt,Kate works at the Pentagon and Lacey works for Eric Cantor.
Extra,"What do you do, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,I was just recently elected.
Leslie Knope,I'm a councilwoman.
Extra,Local government is so important.
Extra,My grandma's on the city council in her town.
Extra,Gives her a reason to leave the house.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Extra,Where did you say you were from?
Leslie Knope,It's called Pawnee.
Extra,"Pawnee, Missouri?"
Extra,"Oh, my that is so random."
Extra,I've been there totally cute.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, Missouri, is a total craphole."
Leslie Knope,Ben and I both did some amazing things today.
Leslie Knope,He scored a victory for the congressional campaign he's working on.
Leslie Knope,And I was mistaken for Beverly D'Angelo by a Japanese tourist.
Leslie Knope,"So, pretty big day for both of us."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, can I have a burger?"
Tom Haverford,I'm hungry.
Ron Swanson,"For the last time, no burgers yet."
Ron Swanson,"I've got ribs, and I've got beef cheek."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, where are my vegan soy patties?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I gave them to the kids."
Ron Swanson,They love them.
Ron Swanson,They're skipping them across the pond.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, I got to go to the boys' room."
Jerry Gergich,Can I have a ride in your car?
Donna Meagle,Absolutely not.
Tom Haverford,This barbecue stinks.
Tom Haverford,I'm saying it.
Tom Haverford,It stinks.
Ann Perkins,Do you have any plates or anything?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, how are we supposed to eat these rumps?"
Jerry Gergich,"Ron, if no one takes me to the bathroom, I'm just going to have to go in the trees."
Ron Swanson,All right.
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,You have ruined a perfectly good barbecue with your demands and chatter.
Ron Swanson,Enjoy the rest of your evening.
Leslie Knope,Does anybody feel like they can't breathe?
Leslie Knope,I think I need some fresh air.
April Ludgate,We're outside.
Leslie Knope,"God, these women they're so smart and accomplished and pretty."
Leslie Knope,And they're tall.
Leslie Knope,Why are they all so tall?
Leslie Knope,It's like CSpan and Neiman Marcus had kids or something.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so there's a couple more people I want you to meet."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I can't wait to meet, like, five more tall women."
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Senators?"
Ben Wyatt,"Ben Wyatt, from Congressman Murray's campaign."
Barbara Boxer,"Ben, I remember you from the Kennedy Center."
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Barbara Boxer,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I wanted to introduce my friend Leslie Knope Senators Barbara Boxer and Olympia Snow.
Olympia Snow,A pleasure to meet you.
Leslie Knope,How do you do?
Barbara Boxer,"So, Leslie, what do you do?"
Leslie Knope,"I am a city councilwoman from Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope,But you've probably never heard of us.
Leslie Knope,We're small and unimportant.
Olympia Snow,I'm sure that's not true.
Leslie Knope,But it is.
Leslie Knope,We've got tons of problems.
Leslie Knope,We're overrun with raccoons and obese toddlers.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I'm probably boring you."
Leslie Knope,"I just wanted to say that you are my role models, and, uh, you are incredibly amazing women, and it is an honor to meet you, and I really respect your grace under pressure, And thank you for your time."
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Senators."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie?"
Ben Wyatt,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just tired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"I saw 24 historical sights in a day, and it's 120 degrees out with 200% humidity, because this is a stupid swamp town."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, that would make anyone cranky."
Leslie Knope,I'm not cranky.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I thought you'd enjoy meeting numbers 4 and 26 on Leslie's list of amazing women.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,You're the most amazing boyfriend ever.
Leslie Knope,"And if you don't get out of here soon, I'm going to punch you in the face."
Extra,Journal needs a quote for the profile.
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,Just go.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at your apartment later.
Ben Wyatt,This is Ben Wyatt.
John McCain,Excuse me.
John McCain,I just need to get my coat here.
Leslie Knope,"Could you give me a minute here, please?"
John McCain,Are you are you okay?
John McCain,Can I get you anything?
Leslie Knope,"I would like you to just leave and give me a little privacy here, please."
John McCain,All right.
John McCain,I'm sorry.
John McCain,I hope everything's okay.
Leslie Knope,Nosy people have no respect for personal space.
Tom Haverford,Ann what the hell?
Ann Perkins,I put glitter in all your moisturizers and lotions.
Ann Perkins,"I'm calling it ""Sparkle Skin"", by Annie."
Ann Perkins,"Twinkle, twinkle, big star."
Tom Haverford,Ann!
Tom Haverford,"That is an amazing idea, and I will buy it from you, but never do that again."
Tom Haverford,That was really expensive moisturizer.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, well, you ruined all of my clothes."
Tom Haverford,"Well, then, I did you a huge favor, because they stink."
Ann Perkins,Are you serious?
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hello, lovers."
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Ann Perkins,Tom!
Ann Perkins,You're amazing!
Ann Perkins,Kiss me more!
Tom Haverford,Uhhuh.
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Enough of this.
Donna Meagle,"Y'all broke up a long time ago, didn't you?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"We're stronger than ever, so "
Donna Meagle,It's all right.
Donna Meagle,I'ma let y'all have this one.
Donna Meagle,"As someone who has lied a lot about various aspects of a myriad of relationships, I respect the effort you've gone to."
Donna Meagle,Let's call off the bet.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna."
Donna Meagle,No problem.
Ann Perkins,I guess that's it.
Tom Haverford,Yep.
Tom Haverford,The end of a relationship.
Tom Haverford,And the beginning of a partnership.
Tom Haverford,"Let's talk ""Sparkle Skin."""
Tom Haverford,Do we know anyone in product development over at Sephora?
Ann Perkins,"Goodbye, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,Here's a picture of me and April making out in her apartment.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Here's a picture of us making out in Ben's office.
Andy Dwyer,"This is a picture oh, this is us making out I don't know where that is, but you can tell that she's sucking on my lip."
Andy Dwyer,Traveling.
Andy Dwyer,"Making out are you okay, boss?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Not really.
Leslie Knope,"I know I should be focusing on this river cleanup, but all I keep thinking about is Ben laughing in a helicopter with Hot Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,Who's Hot Rebecca?
Leslie Knope,She's just this jealousy amalgam I created.
Leslie Knope,"I combined all of the giant, darkhaired, smartphone power goddesses into one woman called Hot Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,Ah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, Ben's life is filled with senators and briefings and Super PACs."
Leslie Knope,I can't even get a meeting with some bureaucrat.
Andy Dwyer,I don't even know what a bureaucrat is.
Andy Dwyer,"Everything's going to be fine with you and Ben, because if I know Ben, he, too, is an amalgam."
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Point is, you're better than Hot Rebecca."
Andy Dwyer,You're kickass Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,"Long distance relationships are never easy, but you never, ever give up on stuff."
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,That's what makes you
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Andy Dwyer,An amalgam.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, a word?"
Chris Traeger, Are you aware of what's going on out in your department?
Ron Swanson, I am.
Ron Swanson, My department is pouting because I didn't put on a puppet show based on the funniest email chain of the year.
Chris Traeger, I would have liked to have seen that show.
Chris Traeger, My nomination was Jerry accidentally forwards his bank statement to everyone.
Chris Traeger,Classic And depressing.
Ron Swanson," The point of a barbecue is not to do hokey, office joke theater."
Ron Swanson, The point is
Chris Traeger, The point of the barbecue was to thank the department.
Chris Traeger, It was an employee appreciation barbecue.
Chris Traeger," Ron, I gave you the chance to become assistant city manager."
Chris Traeger," And you chose to stay here, which is fine."
Chris Traeger," But if you're going to lead the department, you occasionally have to lead the department."
Chris Traeger, And I say that as one of your closest colleagues and dearest friends But also as your boss.
Leslie Knope, I went to our nation's capital this weekend in order to apply for a federal grant to clean up our city's river.
Leslie Knope," But things move pretty slow in Washington, and I'm not going to wait around."
Leslie Knope," Now, I was recently reminded by someone that I'm not the type of person to shy away from hard work."
Andy Dwyer," What? Did I, Do you need something from me right now?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."
Leslie Knope, Never mind.
Leslie Knope," Point is, I'm going to clean up this river by myself."
Leslie Knope," Every Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., I will be here."
Leslie Knope, Those are my office hours.
Leslie Knope," If you want to come and talk to me or ask me questions or raise an issue, this is where I'll be."
Leslie Knope," Let's get to work, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, The smell is so much worse when you get up close.
Andy Dwyer, Yeah.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, look, a handgun."
Andy Dwyer, I call it.
Leslie Knope,Holy
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, get in here now! Your work is appreciated."
Ron Swanson, Eat some corn.
Jerry Gergich, Wow.
Jerry Gergich," Thank you, Ron."
Jerry Gergich," Thanks, boss."
Ann Perkins," Thanks, Ron."
Tom Haverford," Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson," Also, here's Tom."
Ann Perkins, Aah! It actually smells really delicious.
Donna Meagle, It really does.
Tom Haverford, Give me some of Tommy's ribs.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, heck, yeah."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, Tom."
Donna Meagle," Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford, That's good.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, if I'd known it didn't go well with the guy from Interior, I"
Leslie Knope,"No, No, no."
Leslie Knope, You did nothing wrong.
Leslie Knope, I'm so happy for you and how much everyone loves you and how great you're doing.
Leslie Knope, I just freaked out.
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt, Long distance sucks.
Leslie Knope, It does.
Leslie Knope," But we can do this, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, definitely."
Ben Wyatt, Can you come visit next month? We can take a proper tour of the sights.
Leslie Knope, There's only one sight I want to see right now.
Ben Wyatt," All right, I mean, this is getting weird, but, uh, there it is."
Leslie Knope," I meant the Jefferson Memorial, you perv."
Ben Wyatt, Right.
Ben Wyatt, Sorry.
Ben Wyatt," Sorry,  I don't, uh I'm I'm just Wait."
Ben Wyatt," No, you didn't."
Leslie Knope," No, I didn't."
Leslie Knope,Spin it around and back it on up.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Andy Dwyer, The White House America's most whitest house most notably is where Sinbad lived in the film First Kid.
April Ludgate," Sinbad, wow."
April Ludgate, The other tour guide never said anything about that.
Andy Dwyer, Do you know why it's called the Oval Office? No.
Andy Dwyer, Because of a man Oval Redenbacher
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,Popcorn inventor.
Andy Dwyer, He used to hang out with John F. Kennedy.
April Ludgate, Excuse me.
April Ludgate," Attention, everyone."
April Ludgate, This tour guide is the most amazing tour guide there ever was.
April Ludgate," Please, step up."

Ben Wyatt,"Ah, Waffle Mix."
Ben Wyatt,JJ's diner mug.
Ben Wyatt,New pajamas.

April Ludgate,"""I've been wearing a bandana as underwear for three days now."""
April Ludgate,"Look, there's a picture."
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Ben Wyatt,That's horrifying.
April Ludgate,I love him so much.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so do you have the results of the study?"
Ann Perkins,"Yes, and they're great."
Ann Perkins,Your tax on soda would definitely lower diabetes in this town.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, and I have a great prop for the meeting."
Ann Perkins,"This is the amount of sugar that the average Pawnee from soda, every month."
Leslie Knope,That is gross.
Ann Perkins,It's gross.
Leslie Knope,All that sugar?
Ann Perkins,It's really gross.
Leslie Knope,What a powerful image.
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,What did you put in the sugar?
Leslie Knope,It's so good.
Leslie Knope,My first act as a city councilwoman I've proposed a tax on all those giant sugary sodas so we can discourage people from drinking them.
Leslie Knope,"I believe, with my help, all local restaurants can get healthier Paunch Burger, Big and Wide, The Fat Sack, Coronel Plum's Slop Trough which was formerly Sue's Salads until we ran that out of town."
Ron Swanson,"Ah, councilwoman."
Ron Swanson,"In honor of your neverending quest to personally babysit each and every American citizen, I went to Paunch Burger and got myself a Number two Double Bacon Grenade Deluxe, hash browns, chili cheese fries, and one poached egg."
Ann Perkins,Ugh!
Ann Perkins,Number two is right.
Ron Swanson,I also picked up a 64ounce Sweetums Sugar Splash.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, I love this country so much."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm really glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,"Our political differences aside, I am about to go to my first committee meeting as a city councilwoman."
Leslie Knope,There's something I need to say to you.
Ron Swanson,Please don't.
Leslie Knope,"I know you hate feelings and emotions, but I would not be where I am if it wasn't for you."
Leslie Knope,You hired me.
Leslie Knope,You've always supported me.
Leslie Knope,How can I ever repay you?
Ron Swanson,Get me a refill.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, everybody."
Ben Wyatt,"So, I've been going over your reports."
Ben Wyatt,"Let's try to be consistent with our fonts, okay? There's a crazy amount in these memos."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, people. Consistent font usage, come on."
Ben Wyatt,"Times New Roman, across the board."
Ben Wyatt,"No Geneva, no Garamond, definitely no Papyrus."
April Ludgate,Papyrus?
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,There's no place for that in a professional office setting.
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, April."
Ben Wyatt,"These college interns really need to be whipped into shape, but don't worry, because they call me Devo, 'cause I can ""whip 'em good."""
Ben Wyatt,And obviously make sure the content's perfect too.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, and, uh, 12 point."
Ben Wyatt,13's just obnoxious.
Ben Wyatt,Great meeting.
Chris Traeger,"Out of the way, people."
Chris Traeger,Motivational brigade coming through.
Donna Meagle,Ho ho!
Donna Meagle,"So, you boys are gonna go work out together, huh?"
Donna Meagle,Nice.
Donna Meagle,Whereabouts?
Chris Traeger,Community college.
Donna Meagle,"Eh, that's too far."
Andy Dwyer,Chris and Tom offered to help me train to become a police officer.
Andy Dwyer,"The physical exam is about three months away and I am in terrible shape, but I can already do this So, I'm getting there."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I've got a list of everything that I'm supposed to be able to do to get into the police academy, and number one is, ""be able to run 2 miles in under 25 minutes."""
Andy Dwyer,"That's a typo, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, that's humanly impossible."
Chris Traeger,"When you are able to focus your mind and your body, anything is possible."
Tom Haverford,Anything is possible!
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, recently, many of the local restaurants have changed their ""small size"" option to a whopping 64ounces."
Kathryn Pinewood,"That's correct, and it's great for the consumer."
Kathryn Pinewood,More bang for the buck.
Kathryn Pinewood,Are we putting bargains on trial here?
Ann Perkins,"How could any sane person call that ""small""?"
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, if the customer truly wants a smaller size, there is an option."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, do you mean the ""li'I swallow""?"
Ann Perkins,Does anybody buy that?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Some girls buy them for their dollhouses, but they're not very popular."
Kathryn Pinewood,"I mean, for only a nickel more, you get 64 ounces."
Leslie Knope,"Well, uh, Paunch Burger just recently came out with a new 128ounce option."
Leslie Knope,"Most people call it a gallon, but they call it the ""regular."""
Leslie Knope,"Then, there is a horrifying 512 ounce version that they call ""child size."""
Leslie Knope,"""How is this a ""childsize soda""?"
Kathryn Pinewood,"Well, it's roughly the size of a two year old child, if the child were liquefied."
Kathryn Pinewood,It's a real bargain at $1.59.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ms. Pinewood, but why would anybody need this much soda?"
Kathryn Pinewood,"It's not my place to speak for the consumer, but everyone should buy it."
Chris Traeger,"Come on, Andy, come on."
Chris Traeger,You can do it.
Chris Traeger,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go."
Chris Traeger,"Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig."
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,It's so hot.
Andy Dwyer,It was horrible.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm going to die."
Andy Dwyer,I'm so tired.
Andy Dwyer,Everything hurts.
Andy Dwyer,Running is impossible.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Chris Traeger,"Tom, now is not the time for criticism."
Chris Traeger,How did he do?
Tom Haverford,Andy finished his twomile run in 29 minutes and 43 seconds.
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,I'm never gonna be a cop.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna have to be a robber.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, come on."
Tom Haverford,"Hang in there, pal."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna drive around.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I'm proud of you."
Chris Traeger,"Not because of what you did, which was terrible, but because of what I'm going to be able to get you to do."
Chris Traeger,I guess I'm proud of me.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, man."
Andy Dwyer,Me too.
Chris Traeger,We have so much work to do.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Ellis, have you put the campaign pictures up on the website?"
Ellis,Oh.
Ellis,Yeah.
Ellis,I started doing them.
Ben Wyatt,And are you going to finish doing them?
Ellis,Oh.
Ellis,"Later, man."
April Ludgate,"I actually think you look really good, except for the stick up your butt."
Ben Wyatt,Who do you think drew it?
Ben Wyatt,Was it Nathaniel?
Ben Wyatt,Ellis?
Ben Wyatt,"Man, I feel like these interns do not respect or like me at all."
April Ludgate,"Honestly, you could loosen up a bit on the font stuff. And everything in general."
Ben Wyatt,"God, this is insane."
Ben Wyatt,They're interns.
Ben Wyatt,"They're totally replaceable, and I'm their boss."
Ben Wyatt,Just fire them.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, hey, Jen."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, I'm having a problem with some of the interns."
Ben Wyatt,I'm thinking of making some changes.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Turns out Ellis is Congressman Murray's nephew.
Ben Wyatt,Nathaniel is related to Donald Rumsfeld.
Ben Wyatt,Brittany's dad is Ben Bernanke's dentist.
Ben Wyatt,Every single one of these little twerps is seriously connected.
Ben Wyatt,"So, new plan."
Ben Wyatt,"Instead of firing them, I am going to kiss their asses like crazy."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Ms. Knope, this is about consumer rights, and if they don't want to drink our delicious sodas, we do provide healthier options, like water zero."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about water zero.
Leslie Knope,"The name implies that there are zero calories, like most water, but in fact, it has 300 calories per serving."
Leslie Knope,Isn't that misleading?
Kathryn Pinewood,"The zero on the label refers to the amount of water in it, which is zero."
Kathryn Pinewood,"If you want zero calorie water, try diet water zero lite."
Kathryn Pinewood,It has only 60 calories.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I think we're done here."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, councilwoman, one more thing."
Kathryn Pinewood,"If your tax bill passes, local restaurants will hurt badly."
Kathryn Pinewood,We'll have to lay off about 100 people.
Leslie Knope,You're bluffing.
Leslie Knope,She's bluffing.
Leslie Knope,Are you bluffing?
Kathryn Pinewood,"The second your tax bill passes, this press release goes wide."
Kathryn Pinewood,See you at the meeting.
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope Soda Tax Forces Massive Layoffs."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I need some sugar.
Ann Perkins,"No, no."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no!"
Ann Perkins,Stop it!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you stop it right now!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,"I proposed this bill, but the issue has become very complicated, so before I decide how I am going to vote, I'd love to hear from both sides."
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Extra,"Yeah, I work at Colonel Plump's, and word around the Slop Trough is, they're talking about laying people off."
Extra,"So, maybe you could get off your high horse and help me keep my job."
Extra,Yeah!
Extra,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"Well, sir, I may vote against the tax, because, frankly, I don't take job losses lightly."
Extra,No.
Extra,I want the tax.
Extra,"My husband started drinking those giant sodas, and he's gained 100 pounds in three months."
Extra,"Consequently, we haven't had sex in ten years."
Ann Perkins,II thought you said he gained weight in the last three months.
Extra,"Well, we have lots of other problems."
Leslie Knope,"Well, ma'am, my original stance was that implementing this tax would be good for public health."
Extra,All taxation is theft!
Extra,"If the government can tax me, I can I can do this."
Leslie Knope,"Grover, give that woman her purse back."
Extra,There's a lot of pill bottles in here.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Tom Haverford,Been making some modifications to the pace car.
Tom Haverford,"Speaker system, Mad Men bar, iPad dock, and bam!"
Tom Haverford,Orange racing stripe.
Tom Haverford,It's a perfect recreation of Han Lue's Nissan in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift.
Tom Haverford,"Weirdly, so far, no one has noticed."
Chris Traeger,I want to find something that really motivates you.
Chris Traeger,Why do you want to achieve this goal?
Andy Dwyer,I just want to get a good job for me and April.
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Chris Traeger,Keep going.
Chris Traeger,Dig.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, I love April."
Andy Dwyer,I think she's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,She's all I care about in the whole world.
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Love and family.
Chris Traeger,"What else is there, really?"
Andy Dwyer,Nothing at all.
Chris Traeger,"I exercise because, when I was a baby, I had a rare blood disorder, and I suppose I need to feel like my body's in tiptop shape Ah."
Chris Traeger,"So it doesn't destroy me, leaving me to die alone."
Andy Dwyer,Great.
Andy Dwyer,"You got yours, I got mine."
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna go run till I puke.
Andy Dwyer,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"Guess what's in these boxes, everybody?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Pizza.
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Ben Wyatt,Everybody chill out.
Ben Wyatt,Take a pizza break on me.
Ben Wyatt,"Ellis, what's up, my male?"
Ben Wyatt,"You grab a slice of 'za, brah."
Ellis,All right.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, dude, do you play Ultimate?"
Ellis,"Yeah, I play intramural at Georgetown."
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, so did I, in college."
April Ludgate,"Whoa, you guys should get married."
Ben Wyatt,We should play tomorrow morning in the park.
Ellis,What about the website?
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,You can put those pics up anytime.
Ben Wyatt,"We should lock down some tight disc grabs, am I right, ellbones?"
Ellis,"Yeah, it sounds good."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ellis,It's better than working.
Ben Wyatt,"No doubt, no doubt."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, listen up, pizza lovers."
Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, prework Ultimate in the park."
Ben Wyatt,Everybody's invited.
Ben Wyatt,What do you say?
Ben Wyatt,"Let's do it to it, my dudes."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anyone else?"
Extra,"Yeah, if we put a tax on soda, I mean, what's next, income?"
Leslie Knope,"Sir, you don't pay your income tax?"
Extra,Whether or not I pay income tax is none of the government's business.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, no, actually, it is."
Extra,"Well, you don't know my name or what I look like, so good luck finding me."
Extra,"I think we should tax all bad things, like racism and women's vaginas."
Ann Perkins,We're not taxing anyone's genitals.
Extra,Then what the hell are we doing here?
Extra,"Come on, boys."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, um, let's take a quick straw poll."
Leslie Knope,Hold up green if you agree and red if you disagree.
Leslie Knope,Ann?
Ann Perkins,"""The soda tax is good and will help people get healthier."""
Leslie Knope,"So, about half?"
Ann Perkins,Half.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, ""the soda tax is bad and unfair to consumers."""
Leslie Knope,Half and half.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much.
Leslie Knope,This is very confusing.
Extra,I've got an idea.
Extra,"Maybe instead of me losing my job, you ought to lose your job."
Extra,Let's recall Leslie Knope.
Ben Wyatt,Let's do this!
Ben Wyatt,Nice catch!
Ben Wyatt,Someone please tell me we kodaked that moment.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, rocked that scoober!"
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,"You got it, Howie!"
Ben Wyatt,"All right, April, what's the score?"
April Ludgate,1000 to 7.
Ben Wyatt,"Good sportsmanship, bro."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, repeat after me."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"""I run for April."""
Andy Dwyer,I run for April.
Tom Haverford,"Run for your wife, son!"
Chris Traeger,"""I run for love."""
Andy Dwyer,I run for love.
Tom Haverford,"Playaz, at your marks."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you run for again, Chris?"
Chris Traeger,Nobody.
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Chris Traeger,Does it really even matter?
Tom Haverford,Get set.
Tom Haverford,Get at me!
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, you okay?"
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,There's something wrong with my body.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Chris Traeger,My legs aren't working.
Chris Traeger,I'm broken.
Chris Traeger,I need to go to the hospital and see a doctor right away.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Yikes.
Ann Perkins,You look weird.
Leslie Knope,So do you.
Leslie Knope,That's a lie.
Leslie Knope,You always look beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I couldn't sleep a wink last night, so at 5:00 in the morning, I went to Paunch Burger for a pickmeup."
Leslie Knope,"I couldn't decide what kind of soda I wanted, so I had them put all six in one cup."
Leslie Knope,You know what it tastes like?
Ann Perkins,Disgusting?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Ann Perkins,How are you gonna vote?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"If I vote for the tax, then I might lose my job, and if I vote against it, I might be betraying my own bill."
Leslie Knope,It's like I'm floating in this giant river of ambiguity.
Leslie Knope,I'm under a warm waterfall of uncertainty.
Ann Perkins,Do you just have to pee real bad?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I've lost all of my instincts.
Leslie Knope,I'm lost.
Leslie Knope,I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Leslie Knope,"I'm just gonna have to wait, and when they call my name, I'll do what my gut tells me to do."
Ethel Beavers,Councilman Howser?
Councilman Howser,Aye.
Ethel Beavers,Councilman Howser votes aye.
Ethel Beavers,"Councilwoman Knope, how do you vote?"
Extra,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,Uhh!
Leslie Knope,"Gentlemen, it appears that I have fallen ill."
Leslie Knope,"Mayhaps, might I suggest that we have a aah!"
Leslie Knope,Can we take a recess?
Ann Perkins,Well.
Ann Perkins,"your pulse is super fast, but that wouldn't be out of line for someone who drank and then barfed up a gallon of sugar water."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm a mess."
Leslie Knope,"Everything's upside down, you know?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, when I used to just work here, I was always so sure of myself."
Leslie Knope,Now everything is different.
Jerry Gergich,Jeez.
Jerry Gergich,Do you guys know how to dissolve super glue?
Ann Perkins,"Well, not everything's different, right?"
Leslie Knope,Right.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ellis."
Ben Wyatt,Ellbow.
Ben Wyatt,Ellchupacabra.
Ben Wyatt,Drinkin' coffee.
Ellis,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's it's a it's from 40 years ago."
Ben Wyatt,Never mind.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, that was really fun this morning, huh?"
Ellis,Yeah.
Ellis,Yeah.
Ellis,"Yeah, totally."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh  Oh, wow, look at that."
Ben Wyatt,Did you draw that?
Ellis,"Uh, no, I didn't."
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's really good.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're a you're a great artist."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I can't do this."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I don't care who you're related to."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm your boss, and you can't keep disrespecting me like this."
Ellis,"Hey, man, I didn't draw it."
Ellis,Your daughter did.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ellis,Her.
Ben Wyatt,April's not my daughter.
Ben Wyatt,She's my friend.
Ben Wyatt,Does everyone think she's my daughter?
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,"The point is, she would never do that to me."
April Ludgate,"Sorry, Dad."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, my rock, my steady, guiding light."
Leslie Knope,"O Captain, my Captain."
Ron Swanson,Did you get that soda refill I asked for?
Leslie Knope,"I need you, Ron, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I'm in big trouble.
Leslie Knope,"I need to go back to those chambers in 20 minutes, and I have to cast a vote, and I don't know what I'm gonna do."
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope," Ron, the people at the public forum said they might want to fire me."
Ron Swanson, So what? I've tried to fire you.
Leslie Knope," Okay, Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope, Be serious.
Ron Swanson, I was not joking.
Ron Swanson, Here is your personnel file.
Ron Swanson, See for yourself.
Leslie Knope," ""Brilliant work."""
Leslie Knope,"""Commendation."""
Leslie Knope,"""Above and beyond."""
Ron Swanson,Keep reading.
Leslie Knope," ""Request for termination""? You tried to fire me once?"
Ron Swanson,"No, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson, I tried to fire you four times.
Leslie Knope, What you me four four fired times? 
Ron Swanson,"If you need to boot again, the trash can's on your right."
Tom Haverford," Hey, man, what'd the doc say? Everything okay?"
Chris Traeger," The tests and blood work came back, and the news is terrible."
Chris Traeger, They found nothing.
Tom Haverford, Nothing?
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Chris Traeger, The silent killer.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford," Chris, that means everything's okay."
Tom Haverford, Why weren't you at practice this morning?
Andy Dwyer," Yeah, you should have been there."
Andy Dwyer, I finally hit my minimum requirement.
Andy Dwyer, Minimum champion!
Chris Traeger,"I'm going to die one day, probably, without ever having left my mark on this silly, little planet."
Chris Traeger," I'm gonna die an anonymous, meaningless speck of dust."
Andy Dwyer, Wow.
Andy Dwyer, It sounds like you're really going through some tough stuff right now.
Andy Dwyer, It's too bad there's not doctors for your mind.
Andy Dwyer," All right, well, hey, I'm gonna go run some more laps."
Andy Dwyer, Will you time me? Go.
Tom Haverford," He's kind of right, Chris."
Tom Haverford, You were freaking out because you were thinking about Andy and his family and how you don't have one.
Tom Haverford," Every time something tiny goes wrong, you spiral like crazy."
Tom Haverford, Maybe you should see a therapist.
Tom Haverford, I hope I'm not out of line.
Chris Traeger," Au contraire, mon frere."
Chris Traeger," You are as ""in line"" as a person can be."
Chris Traeger, You are a genius and an amazing motivator.
Andy Dwyer, What was my time?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,43?
Andy Dwyer,Yes! New record.
Chris Traeger," All my life, I have tried to achieve external goals."
Chris Traeger," Run a four-minute mile, climb Mount Everest."
Chris Traeger," But before I can do that, I need to climb the Mount Everest of my mind."
Leslie Knope, I don't understand.
Leslie Knope, Why did you try to get me fired?
Ron Swanson,"The first year you worked here, you drove me nuts."
Ron Swanson," I would say no to something you wanted to do, and you'd ignore me or go over my head and do it anyway."
Ron Swanson," You were insubordinate, stubborn, a pain in my ass, and, worst of all, bubbly."
Leslie Knope, I was a dedicated public servant.
Ron Swanson, Right.
Ron Swanson, That was the worst thing you were.
Ron Swanson," The point is, I ended up withdrawing all four requests to have you fired, because, ultimately, I'd rather work with a person of conviction than a wishywashy kissass."
Leslie Knope," Well, I had conviction because I knew what I believed in, but I know with this new job."
Leslie Knope, I just feel like I've lost my bearings.
Ron Swanson," No, you haven't."
Ron Swanson," You may have wandered into unknown terrain, but you're still you."
Ron Swanson, You know what?
Leslie Knope,Are you gonna pull out some embarrassing photo of me from high school?
Ron Swanson,Take this compass.
Ron Swanson, All great adventurers need one.
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope," And, listen, as far as this firing stuff goes, I won't forget and I will never forgive you."
Ron Swanson, There she is.
April Ludgate," Here's that report you wanted, boss."
April Ludgate, It's funny because it has 30 different fonts on it and you only like one.
April Ludgate, Do you like it?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's hilarious."
April Ludgate," Okay, I'm sorry I drew those pictures of you."
April Ludgate, I was just messing around.
Ben Wyatt," Look, you may not take this seriously, but this job is important to me."
Ben Wyatt," And by the way, you should take it seriously, because I asked you to come work here because I thought you'd enjoy it and I think you're smart, but you have to have some semblance of professionalism, and I need you to give, like, even a 15% effort."
April Ludgate,12%.
Ben Wyatt,15
Ben Wyatt," For God's sake, I'm asking for 15% effort."
Ben Wyatt, It's not supposed to be a negotiation.
April Ludgate, Fine.
April Ludgate, I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,15
Ethel Beavers," City councilwoman Knope, how do you vote?"
Leslie Knope, Aye.
Leslie Knope, Strongly in favor.
Ethel Beavers," The soda tax measure passes, 3 to 2."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I'm very pleased with my vote because I voted my conscience."
Leslie Knope," And by the way, she's totally bluffing about laying people off, you watch."
Leslie Knope," Anyway, I may have made some enemies today, but that is part of the job."
Leslie Knope," And who knows, maybe in the future, my enemies will become my friends."
Leslie Knope, Stranger things have happened.
Ron Swanson, Let's keep it down out there.
Ellis," Yeah, I love cupcakes."
April Ludgate," Ellis hates you, and he has herpes."
Ellis,"Hey, what's your problem?"
April Ludgate,"My problem is you, Smellis."
April Ludgate," Ben told you to finish the website, and if you don't do it, I swear to God, I'm gonna murder you in your sleep."
April Ludgate, I know where you live. 14th street right?
April Ludgate," I'm gonna get a melon baller and scoop your eyes out and eat them, and your congressman uncle is gonna have to buy you a dog to drag your eyeless face around."
April Ludgate, Do you understand me?
Ellis,Yes.
April Ludgate, Do it.

Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,I miss you.
Ben Wyatt,"I miss you, too."
Leslie Knope,Where are you?
Leslie Knope,I'm in my new city council office.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Leslie Knope,"I know, do you like it?"
Ben Wyatt,I love it.
Leslie Knope,"I love it, too."
Leslie Knope,Check this out.
Leslie Knope,Here is my wall of inspirational women.
Ben Wyatt,Ah.
Ben Wyatt,Is that a picture of you?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,I am big enough to admit that I am often inspired by myself.
Leslie Knope,Here are my clocks.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee and Washington D.C.
Ben Wyatt,Same time zone.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is the coolest part ever."
Leslie Knope,I have my own private bathroom.
Jeremy Jamm,Occupied!
Leslie Knope,Oh my God.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,Councilman Jamm.
Leslie Knope,What are you doing in my bathroom?
Jeremy Jamm,I don't known if i would call it your bathroom.
Leslie Knope,Its only door is in my office.
Jeremy Jamm,I think it is crazy that the most junior city councilor gets a private bathroom just because she is a girl.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Jeremy Jamm,Let's solve this.
Jeremy Jamm,Tell you what I'm going to do.
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm going to drop my liquids in here, take my solids down the hall."
Jeremy Jamm,Deal?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No deal.
Jeremy Jamm,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm,Your loss.
Leslie Knope,How?
Chris Traeger,Fun fact about me.
Chris Traeger,I recently began intensive psychotherapy.
Chris Traeger,I may have mentioned that to you already.
Ron Swanson,Several times.
Chris Traeger,"Well, like my therapist says, ""You can't share too much or too often."""
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Gayle and I, we saw a couples therapist for a little while."
Chris Traeger,"That's too much, Jerry."
Donna Meagle,For real.
Donna Meagle,Keep us out your bedroom.
Chris Traeger,"It used to be, when I was down, I called my mother."
Chris Traeger,"When I lacked selfconfidence, I called my running coach."
Chris Traeger,"And now, no matter what emotion I'm feeling, I call one number my therapist."
Chris Traeger,I want to do the same thing for the city.
Andy Dwyer,A psychotherapist for the city.
Chris Traeger,"No, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Chris Traeger,A 311 line.
Chris Traeger,Citizens will call 311 for whatever problem they have.
Chris Traeger,"Uncollected garbage, broken streetlight, and we will direct them to the proper department."
Andy Dwyer,"Chris, great idea."
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Andy."
Chris Traeger,I agree.
Chris Traeger,I love this idea.
Chris Traeger,And I love me for thinking of it.
Chris Traeger,My therapist said that I need to be more vocal about appreciating myself.
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,"You're welcome, Chris."
Chris Traeger,I sound insane.
Chris Traeger,I'm going to go talk to my therapist.
Joan Callamezzo,Welcome to Pawnee Today.
Joan Callamezzo,I am first rate newswoman Joan Callamezzo.
Joan Callamezzo,Pawnee's City Council approval rate is at a dismal 3%.
Joan Callamezzo,That's an all time low.
Joan Callamezzo,Yuck.
Joan Callamezzo,"Leslie, the city council has done very little over the past few years, and what they have accomplished, in my opinion, has been embarrassing."
Joan Callamezzo,And that is a fact.
Leslie Knope,"No, that's your opinion."
Leslie Knope,That's the definition of an opinion.
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, that's your opinion."
Leslie Knope,"The city council has some political gridlock and some partisan bickering, but we're actually about to pass a bill my bill the Leslie Knope Fun In The Sun Act, which will extend public pool hours citywide."
Joan Callamezzo,"Can you say, ""big whoop""?"
Leslie Knope,"Recently, the Captain of the Pawnee Porpoises swim team asked me if we could keep the public pools open longer so they could log more practice time, and I said, ""Absolutely."""
Leslie Knope,Because not only am I a city councilor.
Leslie Knope,I'm a city councilor with porpoise.
Leslie Knope,"By passing the bill, and extending pool hours, we are saying to our citizens that this City Council is determined to better our town."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Porpoises youth swim team, I have a question for you."
Leslie Knope,What is your greatest accomplishment?
Extra,We came in fourth in the County swim meet last year.
Leslie Knope,"Wrong, your greatest accomplishment is happening in two hours when this bill becomes law."
Tom Haverford,Yay.
Leslie Knope,"I just want you to be very proud of yourselves, because this bill is going to start a long romance between the city and its government."
Leslie Knope,Porpoise call!
Extra,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"I'm doing a porpoise call, which we used to do when I was part of your group, but it seems like you don't do it any more and that's fine."
Leslie Knope,I'm not weird.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody leave."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at the city council meeting.
April Ludgate,"Hey, are you busy?"
April Ludgate,And writing Star Trek fan fiction does not count.
Ben Wyatt,Ha ha ha.
Ben Wyatt,I finished it last week.
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
April Ludgate,"Um, I miss Andy."
April Ludgate,"And you probably miss your lover, Chris."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie.
April Ludgate,I had an idea.
April Ludgate,It's Friday.
April Ludgate,Pawnee's only a tenhour drive.
April Ludgate,Road trip?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't know, I was going to try to get a jump on some work this weekend."
April Ludgate,"Dude, 30 years from now, when you're on your deathbed, what are you going to remember?"
April Ludgate,Organizing files or taking a spontaneous road trip to surprise Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,"All right, I'm in."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, we might be able to sneak out early."
Ben Wyatt,You get snacks.
Ben Wyatt,I'll bring music.
Ben Wyatt,We'll jam out to some sweet tunage.
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,This is awesome.
April Ludgate,"Actually, no."
April Ludgate,I don't want to go any more.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
April Ludgate,Just kidding.
April Ludgate,See you in ten minutes.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
April Ludgate,Just kidding.
April Ludgate,We're not going.
April Ludgate,Road trip!
Ben Wyatt,So we're going?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm excited to bond a little with April."
Ben Wyatt,She's like the little sister I never had.
Ben Wyatt,Because the little sister I do have is normal and not terrifying.
Andy Dwyer,311
Ron Swanson,"Well, Diane, for potholes, you want to speak with Public Works."
Ron Swanson,I understand you've tried them four times.
Ron Swanson,Government is inefficient and should be dissolved.
Ron Swanson,Please hold while I transfer you.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, can you help me?"
Jerry Gergich,"I got a 311 call, but it was all static."
Donna Meagle,That sounds like an I.T. Problem.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, how do I get I.T. here?"
Donna Meagle,Call 311.
Ron Swanson,"Oh, hello again, Diane."
Ron Swanson,Nobody answered?
Ron Swanson,"Okay, you know what?"
Ron Swanson,Someone will be there shortly.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, get your lunch, some water, and a 40 pound bag of asphalt."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, boss."
Andy Dwyer,What are we doing?
Ron Swanson,We're fixing a pothole.
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Jerry Gergich,Pawnee 311.
Jerry Gergich,"How can I help Oh, no."
Jerry Gergich,"No, this is not 911."
Jerry Gergich,"No, no."
Jerry Gergich,This is 311.
Jerry Gergich,"Donna, they switched my phone with 911."
Jerry Gergich,What do I do?
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Donna Meagle,Try to help.
Donna Meagle,Now hush.
Donna Meagle,It is heating up in this piece.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that sounds awful."
Ben Wyatt,"Good lord, it is hot."
April Ludgate,"Yes, mercy me."
April Ludgate,Living in this town's like living in the devil's butt crack.
Ben Wyatt,Almost out of gas.
Ben Wyatt,I'll wait till we're on the highway.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the GPS says we should take 495 to 270, but check out this cool alternate route I found"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that is so interesting to me because I'm a map salesman."
April Ludgate,Why aren't we moving?
Ben Wyatt,Because.
Ben Wyatt,Other cars.
Ben Wyatt,Will you not do that?
Ben Wyatt,Please don't.
April Ludgate,That's what you do when you
Ben Wyatt,Please don't do
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, great, here comes a guy."
April Ludgate,Excuse me.
Extra,Mmhmm?
April Ludgate,Why aren't we moving?
Extra,Exit's closed for a bit.
Extra,Presidential motorcade.
Ben Wyatt,I'll just shut off the car till it opens up.
Ben Wyatt,"Holy [Bleep], it's hot."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,"Beautiful, Tom."
Jeremy Jamm,Beautiful.
Jeremy Jamm,Dynamite gums.
Tom Haverford,"Aw, thanks."
Jeremy Jamm,"Tom, do you want to know why I moved to Pawnee?"
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Jeremy Jamm,It's because the two leading industries here are corn syrup and rubber nipples.
Jeremy Jamm,It is a dentistry jackpot.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's genius, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Well, D.D.S."
Tom Haverford,"Doesn't stand for ""dumb, dumb, stupid."""
Jeremy Jamm,I like that.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm going to steal it.
Jeremy Jamm,That's mine now.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Councilman Jamm and I have gotten pretty tight.
Tom Haverford,"And I'm hoping to parlay this into a membership at the Pawnee Smokehouse, Pawnee's most exclusive cigar club."
Tom Haverford,"Overstuffed leather chairs, top shelf brandies."
Tom Haverford,"And that stale tobacco stench that says, ""Welcome to the top."""
Tom Haverford,"You're a member of the Pawnee Smokehouse, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Man, I love a good stogie."
Tom Haverford,I actually just had this personalized cigar cutter made.
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa.
Jeremy Jamm,Real nice.
Jeremy Jamm,"Not my initials, but thank you so much."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, well, it's not Okay."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, so, uh, we're still all good on Leslie's bill, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Actually, Tommy, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,I have wanted this perm since middle school.
Leslie Knope,I could not be more excited about this.
Leslie Knope,"Are you excited, Autumn?"
Extra,"Yeah, definitely."
Leslie Knope,Do you ever give a perm to someone and ever regret it?
Leslie Knope,Uh Ann has told me repeatedly not to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,But Ann's not here.
Leslie Knope,"So when the Ann's away, the mice get perms."
Tom Haverford,Councilman Jamm changed his vote.
Tom Haverford,He's voting no on fun in the sun.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,He promised me.
Tom Haverford,He just said that he changed his mind.
Tom Haverford,Then he told me some veneers could really make my smile pop.
Tom Haverford,Thoughts?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,The vote is in an hour.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to have an emergency strategy session now."
Extra,What about the perm?
Leslie Knope,"The perm must wait, Autumn!"
Leslie Knope,The perm must wait.
Extra,Wait So this means the bill isn't going to pass?
Extra,My parents said that you guys can't get anything done.
Leslie Knope,"Now, wait, okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope,This isn't over by a long shot.
Extra,But it's three to two against us.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know how to do math, Mason."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't be an alarmist."
Leslie Knope,It's very important that we stay positive.
Leslie Knope,Our positive attitude is our greatest asset.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, a word, please."
Tom Haverford,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"The bill is dead, the Porpoises are doomed, and democracy is over."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I decided to get a perm.
Leslie Knope,Ann should have never let me do this.
Tom Haverford,"Look, Jamm saw you on Pawnee Today."
Tom Haverford,He knows how much you want this.
Tom Haverford,He's just trying to get something in return.
Tom Haverford,This is a bargaining tool.
Leslie Knope,"You know, this is why people hate the government."
Leslie Knope,"'Cause just when we're about to do something really good, it all falls apart due to some stupid, selfish jerk butt."
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Screw Jamm.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going to try to get Councilman Milton's vote.
Tom Haverford,Milton?
Tom Haverford,"He's, like, 150 years old."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"He's got grandkids, okay?"
Leslie Knope,And and kids love to swim.
Leslie Knope,And he'll give us his vote.
Leslie Knope,"He's an old person, and I'll talk to him really slowly."
Leslie Knope,He won't even know what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,I just need to hurry up.
Leslie Knope,How do I look?
Tom Haverford,I don't know how to answer that.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, I'm Andy."
Andy Dwyer,I really like your dress.
Zoe Lewis,I'm a princess.
Ivy Lewis,I'm a mermaid.
Ron Swanson,I'm the director of Parks and Recreation.
Ron Swanson,I'm here to fix that hole.
Zoe Lewis,This is our kingdom.
Zoe Lewis,You have to ask permission.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me?
Andy Dwyer,"Your highnesses, we do humbly request thine permission to befix doth holes yonder."
Ivy Lewis,Only if you can tag us.
Andy Dwyer,Come here.
Ron Swanson,Your tax dollars at work.
April Ludgate,"Soundtrack to Pulp Fiction, soundtrack to Singles, soundtrack to Grosse Pointe Blank."
April Ludgate,Why do you have so many soundtracks?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, uh, I kind of look at it like it's your favorite directors making a mix tape just for you."
April Ludgate,Eww.
April Ludgate,"Oh, here's something."
April Ludgate,"""Benji's Cool Times Summer Jamz Mix."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, I you probably don't want to listen to that "
April Ludgate,"Yes, I want to listen to it."
Ben Wyatt,Just 'cause
Ben Wyatt,"no, listen, it"
April Ludgate, I want to listen to it.
Ben Wyatt,We don't we don't
April Ludgate, I wanna hear what's on it.
Ben Wyatt,We don't need to April 
Music,"Shoop  Ooh, how you doin'?"
Music,"Here I go, here I go, here I go again   girl, what's my weakness?"
April Ludgate,Really?
Ben Wyatt,Don't judge me.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, I'd like to talk to you about the Fun In The Sun bill, and I don't mean to rush you, but the vote is in an hour."
Councilman Milton,"When I'm done eating, we'll talk."
Councilman Milton,I've eaten the same lunch for 58 years.
Councilman Milton,"Caesar salad, extra dressing, extra croutons, and extra anchovies."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton was first elected as a city councilor in 1948, as a member of the Dixiecrat Party."
Leslie Knope,Their platform?
Leslie Knope,"""Deintegrate Baseball."""
Councilman Milton,The secret is in the dressing.
Councilman Milton,Try it.
Councilman Milton,It's an aphrodisiac.
Councilman Milton,"You too, my strange, foreign friend."
Tom Haverford,"No, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, eat some."
Tom Haverford,I'm not eating racist salad.
Leslie Knope,"The more we eat, the faster we talk."
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,You can really taste the ignorance.
Councilman Milton,"It's pronounced ""anchovies."""
Diane Lewis,Hi.
Diane Lewis,Diane Lewis.
Diane Lewis,I own this pothole.
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,I'm here to fix it.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, seaweed choke!"
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,That large boy is my colleague.
Ron Swanson,We work at the Parks Department.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, you're not even from the Public Works Department?"
Ron Swanson,"Look, it appeared that no one from the proper channels was gonna fix this, so I decided to do it myself."
Diane Lewis,Do you know what you're doing?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, you have grandchildren"
Councilman Milton,And seven great grandkids.
Councilman Milton,"Tim, Mary, Jack, uh, Tim, Marie, Tim, and Mary."
Tom Haverford,Don't forget about Tim.
Councilman Milton,"Right, Tim."
Councilman Milton,How many is that?
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's very hard to tell."
Leslie Knope,This might not work.
Tom Haverford,"Let me find Jamm, see if he'll bargain."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Councilman Milton,What country is he from?
Leslie Knope,Iceland.
Ben Wyatt,"""Data had never felt this way before."
Ben Wyatt,"Of course, data had never felt anything before."
Ben Wyatt,"But Captain Picard couldn't help but note ""the smile that crept over his mechanical but lifelike face."""
April Ludgate,I'm gonna murder you.
Ben Wyatt,I understand.
Ben Wyatt,Just one second.
Ben Wyatt,"""As they walked down the hall into the bridge"""
Diane Lewis,Lemonade?
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
Diane Lewis,"Hey, I'm sorry if I was curt earlier."
Diane Lewis,"I'm a single mom, and sometimes things get chaotic around here."
Diane Lewis,When you showed up from the Parks Department
Ron Swanson,No need to apologize.
Ron Swanson,I understand completely.
Ron Swanson,This is delicious.
Diane Lewis,"Well, I got it from Food and Stuff, so"
Ron Swanson,That's where I got these gloves.
Diane Lewis,Right?
Diane Lewis,"So, how exactly are you gonna fix this hole?"
Diane Lewis,Just for my own edification.
Ron Swanson,"Uh, I dug the loose gravel out of the hole."
Ron Swanson,"Now I'm using a jackhammer to remove the larger pieces, then I'll spray down the hole to settle the dust and fill it with cold patch asphalt."
Diane Lewis,"Well, thank you."
Diane Lewis,Now I can fix the next one myself.
Andy Dwyer,Ron and Diane  sitting in a tree  k I s s I s s I p p I.
Andy Dwyer,Do you hear that bird?
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Leslie Knope,Support of one of your bills?
Leslie Knope,Committee chairmanship?
Jeremy Jamm,I want your toilet.
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,"Your office, with the private bathroom?"
Tom Haverford,He wants your office.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I don't mean to brag, but, uh, I've got Irritable Bowel Syndrome."
Leslie Knope,This isn't even about policy?
Leslie Knope,Absolutely not.
Tom Haverford,This is a nobrainer.
Tom Haverford,"Just make the trade, everyone's happy."
Leslie Knope,I'm not happy.
Leslie Knope,He shoots down a very helpful bill 'cause he doesn't get to poop wherever he wants?
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm gonna get Councilman Milton, and you can put your butt back in your pants, sir."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, well, love the hair!"
Ron Swanson,"Andy, come help me tamp this down."
Andy Dwyer,"For the last time, Ron, it's princess rainbow sparkle."
Ron Swanson,Holy Moses.
Ivy Lewis,Can we turn you into a princess?
Ron Swanson,No.
Andy Dwyer,I think it would really make Diane happy.
Ron Swanson,Why would that matter?
Ron Swanson,Shut up.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Ron Swanson,Would you please come help me tamp this down?
Ron Swanson,It's a job that requires two men.
Andy Dwyer,Or does it require two princesses?
Ivy Lewis,Please?
Zoe Lewis,Please?
Andy Dwyer,Please?
Councilman Milton,Oh.
Councilman Milton,This is impressive.
Councilman Milton,"You remind me of a young, beautiful Strom Thurmond."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I've been saying that for years."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do I have your vote?"
Councilman Milton,"Yes, indeed."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, there's a lot of salad dressing on your hand."
Councilman Milton,Shall we kiss?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No!
Councilman Milton,Aah!
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Councilman Milton,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Leslie Knope,Please be okay.
Leslie Knope,"Please, still be able to vote."
Leslie Knope,We can kiss if you want to.
Councilman Milton,With tongue?
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No.
Councilman Milton,She tried to kiss me.
Councilman Milton,She was insatiable.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, maybe we should, you know, postpone the vote until the councilman gets better, you know?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, yeah, we're not postponing anything, okay?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm pushing the vote through and it won't pass.
Jeremy Jamm,Complimentary toothbrush?
Jeremy Jamm,You're missing the backs of your upper canines.
Jeremy Jamm,Sloppy technique.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me?
Leslie Knope,I have excellent toothbrush technique.
Tom Haverford,Just give him what he wants.
Tom Haverford,Take the easy way out.
Tom Haverford,I always do.
Tom Haverford,It's so easy.
Leslie Knope,I do not negotiate with dentists.
Leslie Knope,"I'm trying to tell everybody that the government is great, and I think it stinks."
Leslie Knope,I hate it.
Leslie Knope,I hate the government.
Tom Haverford,You don't mean that.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I take it back.
Leslie Knope,"Why did I say that, Tom?"
Leslie Knope,"God, you know me so well."
Zoe Lewis, More Rouge!
Diane Lewis,Everything going good?
Ron Swanson,"I came here to fix a pothole, not be mocked."
Diane Lewis," I'm sorry, it's just-- your face is ridiculous."
Ron Swanson, Thank you for the lemonade.
Ron Swanson, The asphalt will bear weight in an hour.
Ron Swanson,"Time to go, Andrew."
Andy Dwyer," No! Wait, but we were gonna make a sparkle palace! Ron, you're walking across hot lava!"
Zoe Lewis, Oh!
Ivy Lewis," Oh, no!"
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, it's moving."
Ben Wyatt, It's moving.
April Ludgate, What?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,Finally.
Ben Wyatt, No.
Ben Wyatt," No, no, no, no, no."
April Ludgate,What?
Ben Wyatt,No! We're out of gas.
April Ludgate, Aah!
Ben Wyatt,Aah!
Councilman Howser,"Next order of business, the Fun In The Sun Act, introduced by Councilwoman Knope."
Leslie Knope," Councilman, I move that the bill be read in its entirety."
Leslie Knope, Ms. Beavers?
Ethel Beavers,Fine.
Ethel Beavers," Pawnee Municipal Code Amendment, 217-426"
Jeremy Jamm," Buying time, I see."
Jeremy Jamm, What's up?
Leslie Knope, You can have my office.
Jeremy Jamm," Okay, why don't you, uh why don't you sweeten the pot?"
Leslie Knope,You can have my parking space.
Jeremy Jamm, And?
Leslie Knope,And I will get Invisaligns from you.
Jeremy Jamm, And?
Leslie Knope,"And, that is enough."
Leslie Knope, And shut up.
Leslie Knope, And I hate you.
Jeremy Jamm, We got a deal.
Jeremy Jamm, Can't wait to drop my kids at the pool.
Jeremy Jamm," By ""kids,"" I mean turds."
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Jeremy Jamm, Yeah.
Donna Meagle, Then Ana asks Grey to punish her.
Jerry Gergich," Donna, please, can you keep it down? Or at least research how to deliver a baby that's coming out face up."
Jerry Gergich, Lay the mother on her side and try to move the baby in a corkscrew fashion.
Andy Dwyer, Diane is awesome and she likes you.
Andy Dwyer, And you like her.
Andy Dwyer, I can tell.
Ron Swanson," ""A,"" I don't recall inviting you in here, and ""B,"" I did not like her."
Ron Swanson, She's not my type.
Ron Swanson, Her life is messy.
Andy Dwyer," Ron, messy is fun, okay? My whole life is a giant mess and I love it."
Andy Dwyer," I mean, look at my hair."
Andy Dwyer, I have gum in my hair.
Ron Swanson," Listen, I will not pursue Diane."
Ron Swanson, End of story.
Ben Wyatt,"Please, just steer."
April Ludgate,Be stronger.
Ben Wyatt, Ow.
Ben Wyatt, That was a great road trip.
Ben Wyatt, We made it 40 feet.
April Ludgate," Yeah, well, at least it took a million hours, and it was 180 degrees, and we starved to death."
Ben Wyatt,So fun.
Ben Wyatt," Hey, how about next weekend we fly to Pawnee? Tickets are on me."
April Ludgate,Really? That would be awesome.
April Ludgate, Definitely.
Ben Wyatt," Nah, never mind."
Ben Wyatt, I don't feel like it.
April Ludgate," What? Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt, See how it feels?
Chris Traeger,"Excellent work, everyone! Particularly you, Ron."
Chris Traeger, You have one very satisfied citizen.
Chris Traeger, What did you do for her?
Ron Swanson,I fixed her pothole.
Chris Traeger, Is that a euphemism?
Ron Swanson,No.
Chris Traeger,Then great work.
Chris Traeger," In fact, she's out in the hallway and wants to thank you herself."
Ron Swanson," If you're here to complain about the pothole, I guarantee I did it correctly."
Diane Lewis," Actually, I'm here to ask you out for dinner."
Ron Swanson, Really?
Diane Lewis,"Well, I hope you're not the kind of man who needs to ask the lady out."
Diane Lewis, I'm a middle school vice-principal.
Diane Lewis, I don't screw around.
Diane Lewis, Does that freak you out?
Ron Swanson,"No, on the contrary."
Diane Lewis," So, dinner?"
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
Diane Lewis," Well, it'll be casual."
Diane Lewis, No need to wear makeup.
Ron Swanson, I begrudgingly admit that the 311 program is a moderate success.
Ron Swanson," I'm still not sure why the citizen decided to come speak with me in person, but I'm just happy to see a government program finally work."
Leslie Knope," Okay, so let's get ready for the photo, guys."
Leslie Knope, I want you to arrange yourselves from most excited about democracy to least excited.
Leslie Knope, Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope, Everybody's excited? I bet you are! Because your bill just became law.
Jeremy Jamm," Boy, you know, I can't believe you traded your office to keep this craphole pool open for a couple more weeks a year."
Leslie Knope," Hey, can you not say that in front of the kids, please? I'm trying to teach them how great government is."
Jeremy Jamm," Oh, this is a teaching moment? Great."
Jeremy Jamm," Hey, uh, kids? Would you like to learn how Leslie got your bill passed? Councilwoman Knope traded my vote for her What the hell, man? Why'd you do that? "
Leslie Knope,"Um Um, because it's fun in the sun! Everybody in the pool!"
Tom Haverford,"Yay, pool!"
Leslie Knope,"Yay, democracy! Oh, no, my perm."
Leslie Knope, Ta da.
Leslie Knope, What do you see?
Tom Haverford,Your new city council office.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope," And it is across the courtyard from your office, so we can wave at each other."
Leslie Knope," But it is also Pawnee's newest and most exclusive cigar club, Tom's Smokehouse."
Tom Haverford," Whoa! ""Smoke Dog."""
Leslie Knope,And the Tommy Haverford member's chair.
Tom Haverford, Now you're talking.
Tom Haverford," Man, Jamm's gotta be pretty mad at us."
Leslie Knope, I ain't scared of him.
Leslie Knope, He's a punk.
Leslie Knope, To making things happen.
Tom Haverford, I'll puff to that.
Tom Haverford, I do not like this.

Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,What's with the getup?
Ann Perkins,I just got back from that dude ranch with Ricky.
Ann Perkins,It was really fun.
Ann Perkins,He bought this for me as a gift.
Leslie Knope,A cowboy hat from your cowboy friend.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that makes it sound like he's a cow."
Leslie Knope,From your cowboy boyfriend.
Leslie Knope,Your boy cow cow boy.
Ann Perkins,"Just call him ""Ricky."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Great news: Lots of old people have chlamydia.
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Seniors in Pawnee have a lot of time on their hands, and what they're doing with that time is going at it hard, old people style."
Leslie Knope,"A lot of them haven't had proper sex education, and as a result, STDs are having a field day."
Leslie Knope,It's amazing what a few old guys can do with a little bit of charm and a lot of crabs.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, sex avengers, these old fogies are very set in their ways."
Leslie Knope,"They're hopped up on E.D. medication and they got nothing to lose, 'cause they're close to death."
Ann Perkins,"Also, seniors can be pretty ornery."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, actually, I think it's pronounced ""horny."""
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"Let's pretend that we're old people, and we can ask Ann our grossest, most perverted sex questions."
Leslie Knope,I'll start.
Leslie Knope,"I'm an old lady, why do I need birth control?"
Leslie Knope,I haven't had my monthly since LBJ was president.
Ann Perkins,"Well, with the elderly, we are not so concerned with pregnancy."
Ann Perkins,We're more concerned with disease.
Andy Dwyer,Do pubic hairs get longer the older you get?
Ann Perkins,"I don't think so, no."
Andy Dwyer,Because that's happening to me.
Andy Dwyer,What should I do?
Donna Meagle,Where can I get lube that is healthy to eat?
Andy Dwyer,I ran over my testicles with my jazzy scooter.
Leslie Knope,"I think you're good to go, nursey."
Leslie Knope,I want to jump on that caboose.

Ron Swanson,You live 3 miles from here.
Tom Haverford,"3.4, according to my GPS, which I used to use every day."
Tom Haverford,I can't use screens for a week.
Tom Haverford,Big deal!
Tom Haverford,I'm adapting.

Congressman Murray,"It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Ben."
Congressman Murray,Heard such great things.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, I really feel like I know you already."
Ben Wyatt,I've watched all of your speeches and debates.
Ben Wyatt,It's very inspiring.
Congressman Murray,"Thank you, Ben."
Congressman Murray,And thank you all for your hard work.
Congressman Murray,"Now, stay cool."
Congressman Murray,It's a hot one out there today.
April Ludgate,"That's right, you could practically cook an egg on the sidewalk."
Congressman Murray,Terrific.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's make sure we're ready for the strategy session tomorrow."
April Ludgate,Okay.

Leslie Knope,"Oh, my."
Extra,"I have two partners, often at the same time."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Does anyone know what we risk when we have unprotected sex?
Extra,Heart attack.
Extra,Falling in love.
Extra,Partner dies on top of you!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, but the truth is, the greatest risk you face is sexually transmitted diseases."
Andy Dwyer,Are these old people really having sex with each other?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, what'd you think they were doing?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I thought we were just talking about it."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Leslie Knope,And the best way to prevent them is to use protection.
Extra,"Well, that's all fine and good, but what if the banana is soft and mushy, and doglegs sharply to the left?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, Jerry, when you check your email, you go to Altavista and type ""Please go to yahoo.com?"""
Jerry Gergich,"Well, how else would I do it?"
Tom Haverford,You don't have your email bookmarked?
Tom Haverford,Do you have any bookmarks?
Jerry Gergich,What's bookmarks?
Tom Haverford,"God, Jerry!"
Tom Haverford,You don't deserve the Internet!
Tom Haverford,"I'm going crazy, Ron!"
Tom Haverford,Life without screens is pointless.
Tom Haverford,I made an iPhone out of paper.
Tom Haverford,"It's not the same, though."
Ron Swanson,This is the work of a lunatic.
Ron Swanson,You need to detox.
Ron Swanson,"Tomorrow, we'll go to my cabin in the woods."
Ron Swanson,"It's so far away from civilization, the electric company is not even aware there's a structure there."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"And hey, can you give me a ride after work?"
Tom Haverford,There's no chance I can find my way home.
Donna Meagle,"If you encounter this scenario, simply execute the following maneuver."
Chris Traeger,And stop!
Chris Traeger,"Great job, and very informative, but we need to stop now forever and pretend like this never happened."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,What happening?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,Marcia and Marshall Langman are the town's morality watchdogs.
Leslie Knope,"Marcia is motivated, calculating, and hypervigilant, and her husband, Marshall, is vivacious."
Marshall Langman,"This, that's happening here, is not allowed!"
Marcia Langman,We at the society for family stability foundation object to this smut being taught.
Marcia Langman,It's against Pawnee's abstinence only sex education law.
Ann Perkins,That's only for schools.
Chris Traeger,"Actually, it's not."
Chris Traeger,"The way the bill is drafted prohibits any government employee from teaching anything but abstinence, city wide."
Marshall Langman,"Thank you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Marcia Langman,"If we allow this filth to be taught to our seniors, the next you thing you know, it'll be in our high schools, then our kindergartens, and before you know it, we have babies in thong underwear."
Marcia Langman,Is that what you want?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's what I want."
Marshall Langman,"Ladies and gentlemen, this vulgar sex show is over."
Marshall Langman,Please forget everything this horrible woman has told you.
Leslie Knope,It is not over.
Leslie Knope,It is far from over.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, pack up our bananas!"
Tom Haverford,This is a great idea.
Tom Haverford,"Fresh air, no screens."
Tom Haverford,I'm getting really good at chopping wood too.
Ron Swanson,You're a regular Paul Bunyan.
Tom Haverford,Ow!
Tom Haverford,I got stung by the wood!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, it's a splinter."
Tom Haverford,I need to get on webMD now!
Tom Haverford,"I need a iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, something with 4G."
Tom Haverford,There's no time for the edge network.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Tom Haverford,Wha?
Tom Haverford,Wwwaa!
Ron Swanson,Got it.
Tom Haverford,"I still think we should find a computer and Google ""sterilization techniques."""
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, I have a new idea."
Ron Swanson,You need to purge all of this garbage from your system.
Ron Swanson,"Talk about all the things you do on those screens, and let the words just float away into the fresh air,  and then we will be done."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, worth a shot."
Tom Haverford,"Every day I start by hitting up Facebook, Twitter, tumblr, and Instagram."
Tom Haverford,"Sometimes I like to throw in LinkedIn, for the professional shorties."
Ron Swanson,See?
Ron Swanson,That was easy.
Tom Haverford,Then I like to go on reddit.
Tom Haverford,"Reddit's great, 'cause it has all the important links you need."
Donna Meagle,New shirt?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,I got it at the dude ranch with my boyfriend.
Ann Perkins,You like it?
Donna Meagle,"It's not my favorite shirt, but it is my least favorite shirt."
Marcia Langman,"Perd, we strongly believe in teaching and practicing abstinence."
Marshall Langman,"We all have some crazy urges from time to time, but you just can't act on them."
Marshall Langman,You have to bury them way down deep inside.
Marshall Langman,"You have to say, ""Get out of here, you crazy urges!"
Marshall Langman,"You are not welcome in this brain of mine!"""
Perd Hapley,"There are some statistics that I'd like to share with you now, and they are numbers."
Perd Hapley,Some 85% of Pawnee residents support abstinence only education.
Marshall Langman,And the other 15% are perverts.
Marshall Langman,J.K. you guys.
Perd Hapley,"And 100% of Pawneeans are ""perdverts."""
Perd Hapley,That's the name I call fans of this show based on the fact that my name is Perd.
Perd Hapley,"We'll see you after the break, perdverts."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we need an emergency task force meeting."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Ann Perkins,Objective studies have shown that abstinenceonly education doesn't work.
Ann Perkins,People still have sex.
Ann Perkins,"They don't know how to use protection, so the disease keeps spreading."
Ann Perkins,We need to give people practical knowledge.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, your expertise is thrilling, and frankly, almost arousing, but the law is the law."
Ann Perkins,"Well, you're on city council now."
Ann Perkins,Change the law.
Leslie Knope,The people support this.
Leslie Knope,I couldn't fight those numbers even if I wanted to.
Leslie Knope,It's political suicide.
Ann Perkins,So we're just gonna do the thing we know doesn't work?
Ann Perkins,Great plan.
Leslie Knope,"There's no other option, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Put away your sex toys and play with them on your own time.
Andy Dwyer,"I did eat all the bananas, so you can't play with those."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, nice work on the jobs research."
April Ludgate,Shh!
April Ludgate,Look.
Ben Wyatt,What am I looking at?
Ben Wyatt,He's not doing anything.
April Ludgate,That's the point.
April Ludgate,"This morning he got in, sat down in there, and has been staring straight ahead, doing nothing."
April Ludgate,He's a robot.
Ben Wyatt,He's not a robot.
Ben Wyatt,He's just thinking.
Ben Wyatt,He's got a lot on his mind.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like, ""One, one, zero, one."
April Ludgate,"Must eat babies for fuel."""
Ben Wyatt,Why would a robot need to consume organic matter?
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"You know what, they probably put a TV in there, and he's watching old speeches to bone up or something."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go see.
Ben Wyatt,"Congressman, here is the briefing packet for our strategy meeting later."
Congressman Murray,"Excellent, thank you."
Congressman Murray,Anything else I can do for you?
April Ludgate,"No, sir."
April Ludgate,All systems are operational.
Congressman Murray,Great.
Congressman Murray,Stay cool.
Congressman Murray,Hot one out there today.
Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, congressman."
Tom Haverford,Wikipedia: Mankind's greatest invention/ you can learn about anything.
Tom Haverford,"Take Ray J, for example."
Tom Haverford,"We all know he's a singer, he's Brandy's brother, and he was in that classic sex tape with Kim Kardashian, but did you also know he's Snoop Dogg's cousin and he was in the '96 Tim Burton movie Mars Attacks?"
Tom Haverford,"Suddenly, you're on the Mars Attacks page."
Tom Haverford,I love GChat.
Tom Haverford,You can talk to anybody.
Tom Haverford,I hit up Brad.
Tom Haverford,Pitt.
Tom Haverford,It wasn't the actor.
Tom Haverford,It's actually a guy named Brad that's a teacher in Pittsburgh.
Tom Haverford,"We don't have a lot in common, but we chat quite a bit."
Tom Haverford,"""Emoji"" are little cartoons you text instead of words."
Tom Haverford,"Instead of saying, ""What up, boo?"""
Tom Haverford,"You can type ""What up,"" and then a cute, little ghost, 'cause that means ""boo."""
Tom Haverford,"There's even a little Indian guy, but he has a turban on, which I think is racist, but the Asian guy also has a racist hat on, and it's like, ""Hold up, didn't Japanese people invent this?"""
Tom Haverford,Podcasts.
Tom Haverford,"There are a million of 'em, and they're all amazing."
Tom Haverford,"JeanRalphio and I have one called ""Nacho average podcast,"" where we rate different kinds of nachos."
Tom Haverford,It seems like
Ron Swanson,"Okay, that's enough!"
Ron Swanson,No more talking.
Tom Haverford,But you told me to get it all out of my system.
Ron Swanson,I had no idea how much you had in your system.
Ron Swanson,"This is a real problem, tom."
Ron Swanson,You are an addict and you need to change.
Tom Haverford,I've downloaded every episode of Intervention.
Tom Haverford,I know what to do here.
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,I am an addict.
Tom Haverford,I've hurt all my friends and family with my addiction.
Tom Haverford,I will accept this gift of rehabilitation.
Ron Swanson,"I'm proud of you, but also a bit fearful that we're verging on what I call ""feelings territory,"" so let's stare at the fire in silence."
Tom Haverford,"I've had a breakthrough, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"What do you say you chop up some more wood, and I'll take your car and go grab us some victory steaks?"
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Marcia Langman,I'm so glad you've come to your senses.
Marshall Langman,Here's our educational pamphlet.
Marshall Langman,I recommend you start reading at chapter three.
Leslie Knope,"""Chapter three."
Leslie Knope,"There's a party in your pants and no one is invited."""
Ann Perkins,This is crazy.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, obviously, the best way to prevent disease is to magically stop all sex, but that's not gonna happen."
Marcia Langman,"Well, maybe not where you come from in ""Trampsylvania."""
Marshall Langman," Good one, honey!"
Ann Perkins,I'm from Michigan!
Ann Perkins,That wasn't worth saying.
Ann Perkins,Why are you doing this?
Ann Perkins,You're gonna get up there and say a bunch of stuff you don't believe?
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's the law."
Ann Perkins,I get that.
Ann Perkins,I just You're not acting like yourself.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,You want to go there?
Ann Perkins,Go where?
Leslie Knope,You know where we're going.
Ann Perkins,"No, I have no idea, honestly."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I guess we're going there."
Ann Perkins,Are we leaving?
Leslie Knope,You want me to act like myself?
Leslie Knope,You're dressed like a cowboy!
Ann Perkins,So?
Ann Perkins,"It's fun, and I like it."
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Andy, you dressed in flannels."
Leslie Knope,"When you dated Chris, you dressed in spandex."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please do not lecture me about acting like myself."
Ann Perkins,You're dressed like an abstinence girl on the outside!
Ann Perkins,"God, I'm off my comeback game right now."
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"I don't care, do whatever you want."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Marshall Langman,"Girl, you look like Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking had a baby and I love it."
Tom Haverford,"A deer jumped in front of the car, and then a bear jumped in front of the deer!"
Ron Swanson,"""'Tommy edamame' is back on the grid."""
Ron Swanson,"""Tell everyone to light me up with their dijjies, gotta load 'em into my burner."""
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I went to best buy and bought a phone."
Ron Swanson,"Out of the car, now."
Tom Haverford,"Where are we going, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Are we walking to best buy to get a better phone?
Marshall Langman,"I'm Marshall Langman and I'm here to say   that sex before marriage is never the way   I waited till marriage and then some to do it   if you decide to sin, you'll rue it!"
Marshall Langman,Word.
Marcia Langman,Whoo!
Marcia Langman,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Marshall."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, my aged friends."
Leslie Knope,Some of you might remember that I was here before.
Extra,I don't remember that.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was."
Leslie Knope,But I have a new message for you.
Leslie Knope,The best way to be safe is to simply postpone sex until marriage.
Extra,I am not going to be told not to have sex by someone who's ten years my junior.
Ann Perkins,"Amen, Gladys."
Ann Perkins,You're right!
Ann Perkins,"Not about the age thing, about the other thing."
Leslie Knope,"Perhaps you might understand it better if I read to you from this pamphlet, So you think you know more than God."
Leslie Knope,"""Our bodies are God's gift, ""but they're also the devil's playground."
Leslie Knope,"""The devil likes to hide ""in all your private nooks and crannies, ""and if you open too wide, he might get out, or in."""
Leslie Knope,What?
Extra,Can we just see the condom demonstration again?
Extra,'Cause I don't know where Lou has been.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I wish I could, but I Oh, screw it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here."
Leslie Knope,"This is a penis, right?"
Leslie Knope,"You put a condom on it, and you pull the tip like this, and you roll it all the way down the penis."
Leslie Knope,"Tell you what, condoms for everybody!"
Leslie Knope,Who wants some?
Leslie Knope,Safe sex for everybody!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Marshall Langman,This is
Leslie Knope,"Hey, who wants to party?"
Leslie Knope,It's a censure from the mayor's office.
Leslie Knope, It's so official.
Leslie Knope," I mean, look at the paper quality."
Leslie Knope, This is no joke.
Leslie Knope," I know I'm supposed to help educate the public, but I also have an obligation to uphold the laws."
Leslie Knope, You're my boss.
Leslie Knope, What's my move here?
Chris Traeger,"Actually, Leslie, you're my boss now."
Leslie Knope, That's right.
Leslie Knope, Why am I still weirdly scared of you?
Chris Traeger, I'm very confident and I make a lot of eye contact.
Leslie Knope, Hmm.
Chris Traeger," As your city manager, I recommend that you formally apologize and that, in the future, you stick to the letter of the law, but between you and me, as your best friend"
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris Traeger,I kind of admire what you did up there.
Chris Traeger, Made me happy that I voted for you as my city council member.
Extra," Okay, this is great, just make sure that you don't go too tight on him, all right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
Ben Wyatt," What's the deal with the congressman? Seriously, like, he seems a little robotic Or something?"
Extra," Yeah, yeah, he's great, yeah."
Extra," He turns it on when he has to, and when he doesn't, he just sits there."
Extra," There's no surprises, it's perfect."
Extra," Oh, congressman, can you just sit in the chair to test the satellite feed?"
Congressman Murray,Okey-dokey.
Extra, Just run through some of your stump speech.
Congressman Murray," We've gone through some difficult times, but we're from Ohio."
Congressman Murray, We're tough.
Congressman Murray," We won't just survive these dark times, we will thrive!"
Extra, That's great.
Extra, Good.
Congressman Murray, Cool beans.
Congressman Murray, See you guys later.
Extra," God, I love him."
Extra, He's the best.
Tom Haverford, I'm sorry I crashed your car.
Tom Haverford," Please forgive me, Ron."
Tom Haverford," Please, Ron? Please? What are you doing? Are you going to kill me?"
Ron Swanson,"Why do you need to be constantly distracted, tom?"
Tom Haverford,"The truth is I spend a lot of time looking at screens because recently, a lot of the stuff in my real life isn't going that great."
Tom Haverford, So I'd rather play Doodle Jump then think about that.
Tom Haverford," Okay? I'm sorry, I really am."
Ron Swanson, Go sit in your office while I consider whether to turn you in to the judge.
Ron Swanson," And while you're there, neither doodle nor jump."
Ann Perkins, Hey.
Ann Perkins, I just wanted to come lend my support.
Ann Perkins, What are you going to say out there?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope," I got censured, it's a big deal."
Ann Perkins," Well, if you ask me, you were elected to lead and not to follow."
Ann Perkins, Which is probably what I should've said instead of what I did say.
Leslie Knope, I feel terrible about what I said too.
Ann Perkins," No, you were right."
Leslie Knope," I know, but I still feel terrible."
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry, continue."
Ann Perkins, I kind of lost myself in this relationship.
Ann Perkins," I bought a lasso online, Leslie."
Leslie Knope, Yikes.
Ann Perkins, I turned all my jeans into Daisy Dukes.
Ann Perkins," My personality kinda gets swept up in whatever guy I'm dating, and I want to change that."
Ann Perkins, I broke it off with Ricky.
Leslie Knope," Well, that's good, but I'll tell you, he'll never lasso another heifer as fine as you, Annie Oakley."
Perd Hapley, The story of that commercial break is it's over.
Perd Hapley," Leslie, what exactly does ""censure"" mean?"
Leslie Knope,It means that I have been formally disciplined for breaking the law.
Leslie Knope," Well, you know what they say, ""You break it, you buy it."""
Leslie Knope, That doesn't really apply here.
Leslie Knope," Tell that to the folks at Pier 1, an establishment I'm no longer allowed inside."
Leslie Knope," Perd, I'd like to apologize."
Marshall Langman, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, Apologize for the antiquated laws in this city.
Leslie Knope, States that teach abstinence only have the highest rates of teen pregnancy and STDs.
Leslie Knope, To continue this policy is insane.
Leslie Knope," Look, we all want the same thing, right? We want fewer unwanted pregnancies and fewer STDs."
Leslie Knope," Why don't we use every weapon that we have? I know that most of you don't agree with me on this, but I'm going to fight very hard to change your minds, and until then, I will take this censure, and I will wear it proudly, like a badge of honor."
Perd Hapley," Wow, strong words from a woman who is trying to pin a piece of paper to her blazer."
Perd Hapley," Next up on the program, we hear from you, our fans, in our new segment, ""Are you there, perd-verts? It's me, Perd, hosting a new segment."""
Tom Haverford,I'm so bored.
Ron Swanson," I have something for you, son."
Tom Haverford,My iPhone?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson, I am giving you a non-electronic book made of paper from a tree.
Ron Swanson, It is called Auto Repair Manual: 1982.
Ron Swanson," You will read this book from cover to cover, then you will assist me in repairing the damage to my car."
Ron Swanson," I will not report you to the judge, but if you slip up again, you will have much more to fear than some feeble government employee in a robe."
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Ron Swanson,Two more things.
Ron Swanson," When you do get your phone back, you will not stare at it when you're talking with another human being."
Ron Swanson, Look a man in the eye when you speak with him.
Ron Swanson," And second, if you ever need to discuss your problems with someone find Leslie."
Ron Swanson, She lives for that crap.
Ron Swanson, Get to work.
Leslie Knope, They're killing me in the press.
Leslie Knope," The Pawnee Sun is calling me ""Loose-ly Grope."""
Leslie Knope,But you know what? I don't even care.
Leslie Knope," I'm gonna kick all their asses! I am so fired up! I'm gonna go right now and drink, like, 1,000 Red Bulls so I can draft a new bill to undo abstinence only."
Ben Wyatt," Man, you are just a machine."
Ben Wyatt, Get stuff done.
Ben Wyatt," Hey, why don't you send it to me when you have a draft? I'll try to help."
Leslie Knope,You're the greatest.
Leslie Knope," But you're gonna have to take out a lot of cursing, 'cause like I said, I am very fired up."
Ben Wyatt," Well, you go get 'em."
Ben Wyatt, I love you.
Leslie Knope, I love you too.
Leslie Knope, What are you wearing?
Ben Wyatt,I can't do that right now.
April Ludgate,"Yo, you ready to go?"
Ben Wyatt,"Why, yes, I am, April! Let's go now!"
April Ludgate,What's wrong with you?
Ben Wyatt,"Wonderful! Hey, be careful out there."
Ben Wyatt, Traffic is nuts on the streets and roads.
April Ludgate," Oh, no!"
April Ludgate,They got you!
Ben Wyatt," Terrific! Hey, I'm hungry."
Ben Wyatt,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ah, ha, ha."
Ben Wyatt," Let's go eat some batteries I mean, human food."
April Ludgate," Hey, uh, batteries I mean, human food sounds good to me."
April Ludgate, Wonderful.
Ben Wyatt, Let's go.

Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, I think he might be having a heart attack."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Are you serious?
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,So much stuff is happening right now.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, call 911."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Just breathe, okay?"
Ann Perkins,You're gonna be fine.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, geez!"
Tom Haverford,Did a dinosaur just fart?
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, get a grip."
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, guys."
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,Apology not accepted.
Ann Perkins,"Stop talking, moron."
Tom Haverford,I wish I could stop smelling.
Tom Haverford,Dude.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, Jerry, did you eat farts for lunch?"
Leslie Knope,Tom!
Leslie Knope,Jerry's having a heart attack.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, I didn't know that."
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, you okay?"
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I've got some magazines and those boring word jumbles you like to do."
Tom Haverford,"Is there anything else you need, J?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe some GasX?
Jerry Gergich,"Ha ha, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"How is he, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Give it to me straight.
Ann Perkins,He's great.
Ann Perkins,He should be out of here in a day or two.
Tom Haverford,"Doctor, medically speaking, how would you describe what happened to Jerry?"
Dr. Harris,He had a mild heart attack.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but he also exhibited excessive flatulence."
Tom Haverford,Is there a term for having a heart attack while releasing so much gas?
Dr. Harris,Not really.
Dr. Harris,Gastrointestinal distress is common during a cardiac event.
Tom Haverford,I just want to hear the doctor say that Jerry had a fart attack.
Tom Haverford,Is that too much to ask?
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Jerry Gergich,"Look at all the balloons and the flowers and the food and my goodness, you're so sweet to come visit this often."
Dr. Harris,"Well, they did cause it."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,That's okay.
Jerry Gergich,I'm glad this happened.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, I could do without the mess of hospital bills, but no, this was a wakeup call."
Jerry Gergich,I'm gonna make some changes.
Jerry Gergich,I want at least another 30 years with Gayle and my girls.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, Jerry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You are gonna have the future that you've always planned.
Leslie Knope,Just leave it to us.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I have arranged for the Parks Department to throw a huge garage sale fundraiser for Jerry to help pay for his hospital bills."
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee municipal employee health care plan is kinda crappy.
Leslie Knope,One time I sprained my wrist and our insurance claimed that having a wrist was a preexisting condition.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, how much should I sell this hat for?"
April Ludgate,"I don't know, eight cents?"
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, this is the hat I was wearing the first time I ever heard Vitalogy by Pearl Jam."
April Ludgate,"Oh, $900."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that sounds about right."
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, you're not selling anything?"
Ron Swanson,I am selling this table.
Ron Swanson,I made it.
April Ludgate,So when am I gonna meet your new lover?
Ron Swanson,I'm afraid things have hit a rough patch with Diane.
Ron Swanson,She was not pleased with my babysitting performance and left me a very loud message on my cell phone.
April Ludgate,I'm sure she'll get over it if you just say you're sorry though.
Ron Swanson,"I like Diane, but I'm not sure if I'm ready for a whole family."
Ron Swanson,"If the kids ever wanted to come to my place, I'd have to take a whole week off work just to undo the alarms and tripwires."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, that's my name."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's my Chris Traeger box."
Ann Perkins,All these boxes represent stuff from different eras of exboyfriends.
Chris Traeger,Oh Here are those ankle weights I bought you that you liked so much.
Ann Perkins,"Recently Leslie pointed out that sometimes when I date someone, I kind of adopt that person's personality."
Ann Perkins,The evidence is fairly damning.
Ann Perkins,Chris Traeger exercise phase.
Ann Perkins,Andy Dwyer my grunge phase.
Ann Perkins,Tom Haverford my needless shopping phase.
Ann Perkins,Also my credit card debt phase.
Ann Perkins,Ann Perkins.

Jennifer Barkley," Mr. Kurtzwilder, it might be helpful if you told us why you want to be governor of Florida."
Extra,"Well, I guess you could say mine is the classic Florida success story."
Extra,"I went to SFU law school, I was working at a small firm in Orlando, and one day, bam, just like that, gator eats penis."
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me?
Extra,"Well, that was my first high profile case."
Extra,It was a classic Florida divorce.
Extra,"Guy cheats on his wife with Dan Marino's masseuse, one day she cuts his junk off, throws it in the Everglades."
Jennifer Barkley,Why not?
Extra,Damn alligator ate it.
Extra,"And that case, that case made my career."
Extra,"Now, I just wanna give something back."
Jennifer Barkley,"Frankly, your path to victory is narrow."
Jennifer Barkley,"Governor Scott might be vulnerable, but you have very little name recognition."
Ben Wyatt,But the Barkley Group is the best at what we do.
Ben Wyatt,We're not in the business of losing elections.
Ben Wyatt,We can get you where you wanna go.
Morris,"I'm just saying, you should have put ""spoiler alert"" on all those Death Canoe tweets."
Morris,"Also, not safe for work."
Morris,"You know, a lot of what you wrote was really profane."
Donna Meagle,"That movie's 25 years old, Morris."
Donna Meagle,"And if you don't like how I tweet, don't follow me."
Morris,What are you doing now?
Morris,I'm talking to you.
Donna Meagle,I'm live tweeting this dumbass conversation.
Tom Haverford,You like that coat?
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,But $200?
Extra,It's used.
Tom Haverford,"I paid 150 for it, then added the scorpion."
Extra,You can't sell clothes at a tag sale for more than they're worth.
Tom Haverford,"Um, watch me."
Diane Lewis,Got a minute?
Ron Swanson,Sure.
Ron Swanson,II didn't expect to see you after the yelling that occurred.
Diane Lewis,"Yeah, I was a bit stressed, but I'm not here to make excuses."
Diane Lewis,I just wanted to say that I am sorry for the way I reacted.
Ron Swanson,Apology accepted.
Diane Lewis,Do you wanna say anything to me?
Ron Swanson,Oh.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,You look nice today.
Diane Lewis,You broke my daughter's tiara.
Diane Lewis,You ruined their Halloween.
Diane Lewis,Don't you feel a little bit bad about that?
Ron Swanson,Okay  Um.
Diane Lewis,Too late.
Diane Lewis,Goodbye.
April Ludgate,"Dude, you're totally blowing this."
Ron Swanson,I'm not gonna apologize.
Ron Swanson,"It wasn't even a real tiara, for God's sake."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, well, relationship over."
Ron Swanson,Too bad.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, you are so sad."
Ron Swanson,I am not.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, she's right."
Andy Dwyer,I've trained extensively in the art of observation.

April Ludgate,Shh.
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is our final auction item."

Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we need some big bids Oh, excuse me one second."
Leslie Knope,"Um, can you just okay."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, how was the meeting?"
Ben Wyatt,Kurtzwilder wants me to run his campaign from Florida.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm not exactly sure when the job would even starts, but it would probably mean putting our plans on hold."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, you know, obviously you gotta take it, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, I mean, I'm not making any decisions until we talk about this and everything it would mean."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I'm flying back to Washington."
Ben Wyatt,I'll call you when I get there.

Leslie Knope,"Either way, it's for a good cause."
Leslie Knope,Let's raise some money.
Leslie Knope,"Please, we need to do this for Jerry and his future."
Leslie Knope,"This could be great, you know?"

Ben Wyatt,"It's over, we're screwed."
Leslie Knope,He brought his girlfriend?
Leslie Knope,"He wasn't supposed to bring his girlfriend, Ben."
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, Ben!"
Julia Wyatt,Your father brought his little plaything.
Steve Wyatt,"Hiya, Benny."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Dad, hi."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,Unh.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ulani."
Ben Wyatt,Thought you weren't coming.
Steve Wyatt,"Ulani is my girlfriend, and she's important to me, and I need her here."
Leslie Knope,"Ulani, hi, I'm Leslie."
Leslie Knope,What a wonderful surprise.
Leslie Knope,We're so happy that you're here.
Ulani,"What the hell, Steve?"
Ulani,They didn't know I was coming?
Julia Wyatt,We didn't know it was spring break.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, thanks, everybody, for coming."
Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry you all have to go home.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Red Vines anyone?"
Steve Wyatt,We're a Twizzlers family.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are off to a rocky start, but we are gonna fix this."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we will."
Ben Wyatt,I called a cab.
Ben Wyatt,It's outside.
Ben Wyatt,"I gave the driver 100 bucks to sit and wait, so whenever we're ready to go like, maybe right now all we have to do is walk outside."
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to be here now, with you and your parents."
Leslie Knope,Help me make this work.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,Best thing to do is distract them with innocuous talk  about the stuff they care about.
Leslie Knope,"Great, like what?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they're white people from Minnesota, so hockey, fishing, skiing, sailing, and after a few drinks, put on a Prince album."
Ben Wyatt,Don't mention the Green Bay Packers or the state of Iowa.
Ben Wyatt,"And also, I have enough frequent flyer miles to get us to Australia tonight."
Ann Perkins,Everything okay?
Leslie Knope,"Uh, slight speed bump."
Leslie Knope,"Everything is terrible, but I am going to fix it with my secret weapon."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well I will make sure that everything else runs smoothly."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you are such a good friend."
Leslie Knope,"You are a beautiful, talented, brilliant, powerful musk ox."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ox, for keeping this ship afloat."
Ann Perkins,You got it.
Ann Perkins,"Guys, I need your help, okay?"
Ann Perkins,"Chris is in the back room, and he's crying."
Ann Perkins,"Go in there, calm him down, make him feel better."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie and Ben have enough to deal with, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why is Chris crying?"
Ann Perkins,"Uh, he's emotional."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, why is Chris emotional?"
Ann Perkins,"Because he's in therapy right now, and it's dredging up a lot of stuff for him."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, wait, like what kind of stuff?"
Ann Perkins,"Like, I don't know, his friends are getting married, and he's not dating anyone."
Andy Dwyer,Why isn't he dating anyone?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, why don't you date him?"
Ann Perkins,"Because I'm dating myself right now, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I'mI'm trying to figure out how to make me happy.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, why is it always about you, Ann?"
April Ludgate,Self centered much?
Ann Perkins,"Just go, okay?"
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Tom Haverford,Ron in 60 seconds.
Ron Swanson,Tom.
Ron Swanson,I haven't seen you tonight.
Tom Haverford,I've been working on my presentation.
Tom Haverford,"I just came by to congratulate Leslie, and then I'm heading back."
Ron Swanson,I admire the work ethic.
Ron Swanson,I'm always looking for new investments.
Ron Swanson,"Ever since I got my first job at the age of nine, I have put all my money into gold, which is currently at an all time high."
Ron Swanson,So I have a certain amount of money.
Ron Swanson,I've said too much.
Ron Swanson,Looking forward to tomorrow.
Tom Haverford,Yes About that.
Tom Haverford,"I was wondering, is there any chance we could reschedule?"
Tom Haverford,"I just want to make sure everything is up to my worldclass ""standees."""
Ron Swanson,"I like to keep my appointments, son, and I like others to do the same."
Tom Haverford,"Of course, yes."
Tom Haverford,"No problem, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow."
Tom Haverford,I think you're gonna be very impressed with our presentation.
Ron Swanson,"""Our presentation""?"
Ron Swanson,Who else is joining you?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ricka ricka ricka ricka!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Swanson.
Ron Swanson,JeanRalphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's me.
Ron Swanson,I didn't realize you were a part of this.
Tom Haverford,Of course he is.
Tom Haverford,He's my business partner.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Clean!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Business partner, now and forever."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold up!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Forever 21.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,21 gun salute.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Salute your shorts.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Kaboosh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I just free associated all over the ""moussetache."""
Tom Haverford,That's just one of many skills he brings to this business partnership.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What are those, shrimp?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ah!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Rethink that move, son."
Ulani,Let's just drive back.
Ulani,I feel weird.
Leslie Knope,"Steve, you like sailing, right?"
Steve Wyatt,"Not any more, since Julia got the boat in the divorce and then sold it to a scrapyard because she's terrible."
Leslie Knope,"Well, at least you don't have to deal with all that boat upkeep now, right, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Yech, no thankee."
Leslie Knope,Let's talk about something other than sailing.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you head in the other room?
Leslie Knope,I have a surprise that there she goes.
Leslie Knope,"There's a surprise for you, so, um, head on in."
Steve Wyatt,I don't like surprises.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, you gave it a try, but this quilt thing is not going to work."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, on three separate occasions, I have used a quilt to mend fences."
Leslie Knope,"In ninth grade, a quilt ended an argument between my two best friends, and a quilt settled the Donna Jerry parking lot feud of 2006."
Ben Wyatt,What was the third time?
Leslie Knope,Right [Bleep] now.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I still don't think it's gonna work, but I am really attracted to you right now."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,"Police, open up!"
Andy Dwyer,We have a warrant!
Andy Dwyer,"Just kidding, it's us."
Andy Dwyer,"Ha, we got you!"
Chris Traeger,Andy and April.
April Ludgate,We have someone who wants to see you!
Chris Traeger,Champion!
Chris Traeger,Come here.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, big boy."
Chris Traeger,"You are such a brave, good dog, with so much spirit."
Chris Traeger,You've overcome so much.
Chris Traeger,You are the most wonderful dog in the whole world.
Chris Traeger,And I am so happy for you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, I have a surprise for all of you."
Leslie Knope,Voila!
Leslie Knope,The Knope Wyatt unity quilt!
Leslie Knope,"It represents our two families coming together, and there is a personalized square for each member of our joint family, see?"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Sweetheart, this is lovely."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Mom."
Ulani,Where's my square?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're not technically"
Steve Wyatt,Not technically what?
Julia Wyatt,Not technically an adult.
Steve Wyatt,"This is a very thoughtless omission, Leslie, and as far as I'm concerned, if there's no Ulani square, this is not a legitimate unity quilt."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that old Chestnut."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I will make an Ulani square.
Leslie Knope,"Very, very easy."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Look, this is your square now."
Leslie Knope,"What does ""Ulani"" mean?"
Ulani,"""Cheerful."""
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,Look at that.
Leslie Knope,Unity!
Leslie Knope,It's that simple.
Leslie Knope,All we had to do was
Julia Wyatt,I don't want her name on my quilt.
Leslie Knope,It's not your it's everyone's quilt.
Leslie Knope,It's a unity quilt.
Ulani,I think it's mean that you didn't do a square for me.
Steve Wyatt,It's a disaster is what it is.
Julia Wyatt,"You can say that again, Steve."
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben, they're agreeing."
Leslie Knope,It's working.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm thinking we junk everything except the mannequins."
Tom Haverford,Ron's gotta see how dope the outfits are.
Tom Haverford,That's the business.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why are we going to Ron?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ron should be coming to us!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,We created Entertainment 720.
Tom Haverford,Which was a huge failure.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I don't know
Tom Haverford,"Look, a bank's not gonna give us a loan, and Ron loves my entrepreneurial spirit."
Tom Haverford,"Trust me, he's our best chance at getting startup money."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I hear that.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Let's go clubbing.
Tom Haverford,"No, we gotta work."
Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear me say we gotta junk most of the presentation?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tommy, I will always be there for you, no matter what, but right now, I cannot be there for you because I have to go."
Tom Haverford,"I hate to say this, but Sometimes you've gotta work a little, so you can ball a lot."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That was beautiful.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That changed me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll give you ten minutes.
Ann Perkins,"You have to try to eat something, okay?"
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,"Wow, that's amazing."
Ann Perkins,See?
Ann Perkins,There you go.
Chris Traeger,This one's not as good.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, Chris, here's the plan."
Andy Dwyer,I'm just gonna list off happy things until you're cheered up.
Andy Dwyer,"Pizza, the beach, rock and roll music "
April Ludgate,and I'll list terrible things to bring you back down.
April Ludgate,"Smallpox, botched surgery, snails crawling out of your mouth."
Chris Traeger,This is weirdly working.
Chris Traeger,It's evening me out.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, keep going, keep going."
Andy Dwyer,Laughter.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your mouth.
Andy Dwyer,The beach.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out  out of your mouth.
Andy Dwyer,Cute cats.
April Ludgate,Snails crawling out of your butt.
Andy Dwyer,Dave Matthews Band.
April Ludgate,Dave Matthews Band.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, Dad, Leslie worked really hard on this, so can you just cool it for, like, 30 seconds?"
Steve Wyatt,"Sure, I can."
Steve Wyatt,But your mother can't.
Steve Wyatt,See?
Steve Wyatt,"She's ruining your quilt, just like she ruined our marriage!"
Ben Wyatt,Mom!
Ulani,"Oh, I didn't know we could cut that."
Julia Wyatt,"It had to be done, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,It absolutely did not have to be done.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Look, champagne!"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, why don't we just forget about the quilt  and just raise a glass?"
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,Toasts are fun.
Ben Wyatt,They usually signify the end of a party.
Ben Wyatt,"Here you are, Ulani."
Ulani,"I'm good, thanks."
Julia Wyatt,"Oh, by all means, go ahead and take it, Ulani."
Julia Wyatt,"Or, wait, are you even old enough to drink?"
Ulani,"Yes, Julia, I am, but I can't because I'm pregnant."
Ben Wyatt,You're what?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, boy."
Steve Wyatt,"I didn't mean to steal your spotlight, but the cat's out of the bag."
Steve Wyatt,"Young Ben is going to have a new baby sister, huh?"
Steve Wyatt,"Still firing bullets, son."
Julia Wyatt,I cannot be in the same room as him.
Ben Wyatt,What about the wedding?
Julia Wyatt,I'm talking about the wedding.
Ben Wyatt,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Wyatt family."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,It's like the war of the Wyatts out there!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's so brutal!"
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Were you and Dad ever like that?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Well, like any married couple, honey, your father and I fought occasionally, and sometimes he won the argument, and sometimes I won."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"But usually, we forgot what we were arguing about and just had sex."
Leslie Knope,La la la la la.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"Anyway, the important thing is that we always ended up on the same team."
Marlene Griggs-Knope,And in the same bed.
Marlene Griggs-Knope,"God, I miss that man."
Leslie Knope,How can you be so wise and so inappropriate at the same time?
Marlene Griggs-Knope,I'm a parent.
Tom Haverford,I can't figure out how to phrase this mission statement.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Let me get a shot at it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I'm actually pretty good at this stuff.
Tom Haverford," See? You just googled, ""Amanda Bynes side boob."""
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What's wrong with you? Why is your safesearch on? That is amateur hour, Tom."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Listen, we've been at this for an entire evening."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," I say, why don't we cut our losses? If it was such a good idea, we would be millionaires by now."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Hello.
Tom Haverford," Look, man, I believe in this idea."
Tom Haverford," Do you? You know I love you, but I don't think you're as serious about this business as I am."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Oh, yeah, no, I'm definitely not."
Ben Wyatt," Hey, I got your text."
Ben Wyatt, What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,I grabbed all of the brownies from the dessert table and four bottles of wine.
Leslie Knope, Get in the car.
Leslie Knope, We're going to Australia.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie
Leslie Knope, I am so sorry for everything.
Leslie Knope," I love you, and I want to be on your team."
Leslie Knope," I am on your team, but I think that our team should be far away from here."
Ben Wyatt," Normally, I would get in the cab with you, but I am so sick of them ruining everything, and I really liked that unity quilt."
Leslie Knope, It was a good quilt.
Ben Wyatt, It was an awesome quilt.
Ben Wyatt," Look, my parents are insane, but they need to be at our wedding."
Ben Wyatt, You know what?
Ben Wyatt,It's time for this team to come up with a new plan.
Leslie Knope,I agree.
Leslie Knope," Phase one of our new plan, you get in the backseat of this cab, and we hardcore make out for 15 minutes."
Ben Wyatt, I would love to do that.
Ben Wyatt, I'm just not sure if the driver would be okay with it.
Extra," For another 100 bucks, you can do whatever you want."
Ben Wyatt, Let's do this.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Swan song!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What up, my man? Ow, are you kidding me?"
Ron Swanson, JeanRalphio.
Ron Swanson, I thought you and Tom were working on your presentation.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," No, I decided it was best if I took my talents elsewhere."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you know what I mean?
Ron Swanson,You abandoned your friend?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"God, no."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," He fired me, straight up."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Talked about how I wasn't serious enough about the project, how he needed to grow up."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Anyway, I have an amazing investment idea for you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Condoms with pictures on them.
Ron Swanson,Pass.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Good.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Smart.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I think you made the right decision.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Take care.
Ann Perkins, Oh.
Ann Perkins, Chris?
Ann Perkins,Seems like the storm has passed.
Chris Traeger, Indeed it has.
Chris Traeger, I can't believe that I spent the entire party in a room being happy sad on a night that means so much to my two best friends.
Ann Perkins," I mean, you're going through a lot."
Ann Perkins, You need to purge all this stuff that's been building up.
April Ludgate," This lesbian nurse is right, Chris."
April Ludgate, You can't keep it all bottled up.
Chris Traeger, Maybe you're right.
Chris Traeger, Maybe all of my emotions tumbling out like this means that I can get a clean start.
Ann Perkins," Well, for that, you're gonna have to visit the bathroom first."
Ann Perkins,Right?
April Ludgate,No.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
Chris Traeger," You are, without a doubt, the queen of toilet humor."
Ann Perkins, That's all I ever wanted to be.
Ben Wyatt, This was supposed to be a happy occasion.
Ben Wyatt," You were supposed to come here, celebrate your son's engagement, maybe bury the ax? And not in each other's back."
Leslie Knope, But it did not work out that way.
Leslie Knope, So here is the new plan.
Leslie Knope," I don't expect you to like each other, but you have to come to the wedding, okay? We'll seat you far away from each other."
Leslie Knope, You don't even have to socialize.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, in fact, we insist that you don't."
Ben Wyatt, But you do have to show up and tell us that you had a great time.
Ben Wyatt, That's the deal.
Ben Wyatt," You can either take it, or you can take it."
Julia Wyatt, I can take it.
Julia Wyatt, I'm sorry.
Steve Wyatt,"I'm sorry too, Benny."
Ulani, Sorry.
Ulani, Whatever.
Julia Wyatt," Aw, what a beautiful apology."
Steve Wyatt,Julia
Ben Wyatt,Guys.
Steve Wyatt, Sorry.
Leslie Knope," Ben's parents are insane, but he is not."
Leslie Knope, He's amazing.
Leslie Knope, And that's all that matters.
Leslie Knope, I guess he might become insane as he ages.
Leslie Knope, I should keep an eye out for that.
Leslie Knope," Also, for the record, my unity quilt worked."
Leslie Knope," So technically, I am three for three with unity quilts."
Ben Wyatt, We only have 30 bucks  left.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Leslie Knope," Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope," Get ready, driver."
Leslie Knope, We're gonna make out so hard in the back of your cab.
Ron Swanson," Are you okay, son?"
Ron Swanson,Did you get any sleep?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, not really."
Tom Haverford, I stayed up most of the night.
Tom Haverford, But that's not important.
Tom Haverford, Let me tell you about Rent A Swag.
Tom Haverford,Now
Ron Swanson,"No need, Tom."
Ron Swanson, I'm in.
Ron Swanson," I like doing business with serious people, and when you removed yourself from the company of that moron, you showed me you're a serious person."
Ron Swanson,You have your start-up money.
Tom Haverford, Wow.
Tom Haverford, I appreciate it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Tommy ""T""! You just missed the craziest of crazies."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Clubs.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Girls.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Dancing.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Naked.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Mom? Argument.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Police.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Fleeing the scene.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Hiding in a Dumpster.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Coming here.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Crashing on your couch for a week 'cause  technically, I'm homeless  Hey, ""moussetache."""

Joe Biden,"On behalf of the president and myself,  I wanted to "

Joe Biden,"I mean  I'm confident you could do that job or any other, but "
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I will."

Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's actually the same accounting firm I almost joined last year, and they gave me a great package Three weeks of vacation, matching 401(K), and a pretty sweet windbreaker."
Chris Traeger,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm getting married, and I wanted a good stable job, so I'm going back to Accounting."
Ben Wyatt,"So just call me Bond, municipal bond."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that joke killed at the accounting firm."
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,If it isn't Mr. Looks and Professor Books.
Tom Haverford,He's Looks.
Ben Wyatt,I got it.
Tom Haverford,"Of course you do, Books."

Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm off."
Tom Haverford,This is actually a crazy coincidence.
Tom Haverford,I have a new company and could use your help on the math side of things.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, what's the new company?"
Tom Haverford,We specialize in making stacks on stacks on stacks on stacks.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Pass.
Tom Haverford,I'm kidding.
Tom Haverford,It's a real idea.
Tom Haverford,"So get this Kids are always growing out of their clothes, so their parents don't want to buy 'em nice things."
Tom Haverford,"I'm gonna rent my upscale clothing to middle school kids, because I discovered I'm roughly the same size as the average Pawnee 12 year old."
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a really great idea.
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,"Can you take a look at the business plan, tell me what do you think?"
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,Why not?
Tom Haverford,Awesome.
April Ludgate,"Washington, D.C."
April Ludgate,has more dog parks per capita than most cities.
April Ludgate,"Pawnee only has two dog parks this one and that one, which is also an active parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"Can you say ""per capita"" again?"
Leslie Knope,"I want to take a picture of you saying ""per capita."""
April Ludgate,Stop.
Leslie Knope,I am so proud of you.
Leslie Knope,Now stand next to the screen and think about all the strong female role models in your life.
April Ludgate,Gross.
Leslie Knope,April came to me with an idea to build a dog park in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"I recognized her potential a long time ago, and she's finally living up to it."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I am so proud of her, I could cry."
Leslie Knope,And here we go.
Leslie Knope,One tiny critique.
Leslie Knope,"If you do want to be taken seriously, you might want to think a little bit about how you present yourself."
April Ludgate,"No, this is publicity for Orin's new performance art show."
April Ludgate,He's an animal living on a human farm.
April Ludgate,And you can go and feed him from your own hand.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, that's horrifying, and so is Orin."
Leslie Knope,You should not be friends with him.
April Ludgate,"So, after reviewing all the options, I found that the best location for the dog park is Lot 48, the one behind Ann's house."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I've been trying to put a park there for four years.
Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, April, that lot is mine."
Leslie Knope,"I've been doing slow, painstaking work so I don't want to whip out the legalese on you now, but I got dibs."
Leslie Knope,"What we are gonna do is we're gonna take your enthusiasm, we're gonna bundle it up, and we're gonna find a new place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,Doesn't that sound fun?
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, cheese."
Leslie Knope,Good girl.
Jerry Gergich,"Good morning, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, something is different about my computer."
Andy Dwyer,Aha.
Andy Dwyer,It's gone.
Andy Dwyer,A game is the foot.
Andy Dwyer,"See, part of the police academy entrance exam is investigating a crime."
Andy Dwyer,"So about a month ago I told everyone in the office that, at some point, they should steal something from my desk so I could practice."
Andy Dwyer,Let's do this.
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, hey, did you guys take my glasses too?"
Andy Dwyer,They got my sunglasses too.
Donna Meagle,I was in Miami last weekend.
Donna Meagle,I took my talents to South Beach.
Andy Dwyer,How do you spend your time in Miami?
Andy Dwyer,Maybe fencing stolen computers?
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I took your government computer from Indiana to Miami to sell it on the black market for 150 bucks."
Andy Dwyer,"Haha, you don't know it, but you just gave yourself away."
Ben Wyatt,"Gotta say, I'm impressed."
Ben Wyatt,"Your mission statement made sense, and you didn't use one R. Kelly lyric."
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,So you want to be my CFO?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I already have a job, but I'll help as a friend."
Ben Wyatt,As long as you take what I say seriously.

Tom Haverford,"Yeah, it was a disaster."
Tom Haverford,Too bad we didn't see it coming.
Tom Haverford,"All right, what's my first move?"
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think any of the four previous locations would work, but there's something about this place."
Leslie Knope,"It just has a really good energy here, you know?"
Leslie Knope,lots of natural light.
April Ludgate,It's tiny and awful and loud.
April Ludgate,"And it's zone 14B, industrial waste cleanup site."
April Ludgate,We should technically be wearing Hazmat suits right now.
Ann Perkins,It seems like the kind of place a ska band would go to shoot heroin.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, this is a great place for a dog park."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, there's already a dog here."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I had that exact doll when I was a kid.
Ann Perkins,This is this is traumatic for me.
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry, but lot 48 is the only one that works."
April Ludgate,And I'm definitely bringing it up at the next city council meeting.
Leslie Knope,"April, please, I beg of you, I will do anything to keep you from doing that."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Saw off your pinky toe.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Shave your head.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Have sex with Jerry.
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,"Well, I tried to be reasonable."
Leslie Knope,I have created a monster.
Leslie Knope,And now I need to destroy her.
Leslie Knope,"What do I do, Joe?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie, look into my eyes, take a deep breath, and everything will be fine."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Joe."
Leslie Knope,"God, he's good."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for agreeing to see me."
Ron Swanson,I didn't.
Ron Swanson,You just walked in here and started talking.
Leslie Knope,I don't have time for a history lesson.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am trying to remove parking meters, and there is a guy in Public Works who's being a real thorn about it."
Ron Swanson,Which guy?
Leslie Knope,Ricky Jordache.
Ron Swanson,Never heard of him.
Ron Swanson,What's his deal?
Leslie Knope,He's new.
Leslie Knope,"He used to be a slacker, but now he's realizing his full potential, but at what cost?"
Leslie Knope,"He's smart, and he's beautiful, and I think of him in many ways as a daughter, but that would be crazy 'cause he's a man and his name's Ricky."
Leslie Knope,Here's my question.
Leslie Knope,How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too meish?
Ron Swanson,Sometimes I'd just give you busy work.
Ron Swanson,I once had you put together a brochure about different kinds of Indiana topsoil.
Leslie Knope,That soil brochure was not busy work.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, people still refer to Mulch Ado About Nothing."
Ron Swanson,"And if you were particularly amped up about a project, I'd take you to JJ's and distract you with waffles."
Leslie Knope,Those were distraction waffles?
Leslie Knope,I thought they were friendship waffles.
Ron Swanson,Breakfast food can serve many purposes.
Leslie Knope,"But what if this person, this Ricky, who is real, doesn't like waffles or anything."
Ron Swanson,Everybody has something they're passionate about.
Ron Swanson,"Just figure out what it is, express an interest in it, and divert his attention."
Extra,"Howdy, neighbors."
Extra,Welcome to human farm.
Extra,Here's your animal feed.
Extra,Please don't feed the animals.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is really, really cool."
Leslie Knope,"I like the statement it's making that, you know, we're all in cages in a way."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's actually about death and the city."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I see that now.
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Orin."
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Wicks, if you've read our proposal, you'll see that an alliance between RentASwag and Sweetums could be mutually beneficial."
Jessica Wicks,"Well, I must say it's a much better idea than the last one you had, that gourmet French food thing."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my escargot delivery service, Snail Mail."
Tom Haverford,So you want to partner up and make history?
Tom Haverford,"I mean, you've already made history as the world's most beautiful CEO."
Jessica Wicks,"I'm really sorry, cutie."
Jessica Wicks,The company's laying low right now due to a small mishap.
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, yes."
Ben Wyatt,"The Sweetums molasses storage vat exploded, resulting in a slow moving ecological disaster."
Tom Haverford,"Well, all press is good press."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this was bad press."
Ben Wyatt,A lot of homes were very gradually flooded.
Jessica Wicks,People died.
Jessica Wicks,"Actually, speaking of, we're starting up a nonprofit foundation to restore our name."
Jessica Wicks,Any interest in running it?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm I'm sorry, you want me to run your nonprofit wing?"
Jessica Wicks,"I know that Bobby Newport is my stepson, but the work you did on Leslie's campaign was amazing."
Jessica Wicks,Your name is on our short list.
Tom Haverford,"Just to clarify, it's a no to me on all fronts, and you're offering Ben a job?"
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,"Been looking at your file all day, Jerry if that even is your real name."
Jerry Gergich,It's not.
Jerry Gergich,My real name is Gary.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, Gary if that even is your real name Somebody stole my computer."
Andy Dwyer,"Now, if you're a criminal, look at me, you have to tell me legally, or else it's considered entrapment."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Andy."
Jerry Gergich,It wasn't me.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, really?"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, so we know it's not Jerry, unless he was lying to me."
Andy Dwyer,I can never tell when people are lying to me.
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully that doesn't come up in my police work.
Leslie Knope,I think we should do more stuff like this.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I think Pawnee needs an amazing arts program."
Leslie Knope,Maybe you should just drop everything and coordinate it.
April Ludgate,I'm not stupid.
Leslie Knope,What is that supposed to mean?
April Ludgate,It means that the only reason you brought me here is to distract me from the dog park.
April Ludgate,You hate this show.
Leslie Knope,I love this show.
April Ludgate,What's your favorite part?
Leslie Knope,The heavy handedness.
April Ludgate,"You know what, I have to go talk to Councilman Jamm right now."
Leslie Knope,Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm?
April Ludgate,"Because I told him about the dog park idea, and he loves it."
April Ludgate,He thinks it's a great idea.
April Ludgate,"He's gonna support my motion at the city council meeting tomorrow, and he gave me a really cool dental mirror to check out my molars."
Leslie Knope,"Our dispute aside, you should be careful with Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"He's a snake, I'm telling you."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like I should trust you out of all people right now."
Orin,Moo.
Orin,Moo.
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, weirdo."
Leslie Knope,Aren't you supposed to be a sheep?
Orin,No.
Orin,You are.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shut up."
Ben Wyatt,Tom would make a great profile for your show.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this is a guy who's learned through an unbelievable series of bonehead business moves."
Tom Haverford,"Not to mention in the last month alone three people have confused me for a shorter, Indian Ryan Gosling."
Extra,"It's interesting, but I think I need to wait until the business has been around for a few months, make sure it's viable."
Extra,"You're the guy who ran the congressional campaign  in Washington, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"What, are you gonna offer him a job?"
Extra,Yes.
Extra,"We're launching a new political chat show, and we need correspondents."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you, but I'm a little shaky on live TV."
Extra,That's okay.
Extra,People want authenticity.
Extra,Think about it?
Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear him?
Tom Haverford,He stinks on TV.
Tom Haverford,He sweats.
Tom Haverford,He stutters.
Tom Haverford,"It's like The King's Speech, but the first part, before he's fixed."
Extra,That was my favorite part of the movie.
Tom Haverford,What is happening?
Andy Dwyer,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Yup.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,I know you did it.
Chris Traeger,Did what?
Andy Dwyer,Don't play stupid and handsome with me.
Andy Dwyer,You stole my computer so that I could practice for my police exam.
Andy Dwyer,You're as guilty as you are sexy.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, another computer was reported stolen from the offices on the other side of the courtyard."
Chris Traeger,I don't think this is part of your police training.
Chris Traeger,I think City Hall was robbed.
Andy Dwyer,I can't tell if you're lying to me.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Chris Traeger,I think.
Andy Dwyer,Like a real crime?
Andy Dwyer,That's even better.
Councilman Howser,"Next order of business: It's agenda item 280B, a motion to construct a dog park on municipal lot 48."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, you have the floor."
April Ludgate,"Thank you, Councilman Jamm."
April Ludgate,Your help and general nonawfulness is much appreciated.
April Ludgate,"Leslie, members of the Council, I believe that municipal lot 48 should be a dog park."
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,Boo.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it sounds like there's considerable opposition to this, so I'm sorry, Ms. Ludgate, you should go now."
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,I just heard one hag booing.
Councilman Howser,"Ladies, please, let's keep this civil."
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilman, Pawneeans, satisfied customers of Jamm Orthodontics, as we discuss what type of park to put on lot 48, I had a thought."
Jeremy Jamm,How about no park?
Jeremy Jamm,Who here thinks parks are stupid?
Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show that everyone is raising their hands.
Jeremy Jamm,"I happen to know for a fact that Pawnee's favorite fast food restaurant, Paunch Burger, needs a new location."
Jeremy Jamm,"Now, seeing as how the future of lot 48 is open for debate, I move we sell it to Paunch Burger for a nice profit."
Jeremy Jamm,You don't even have to be Asian to do math that simple.
April Ludgate,You told me you wanted a dog park.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, psych."
April Ludgate,That's not fair.
April Ludgate,You lied to me.
Jeremy Jamm,You just got jammed.
Leslie Knope,I hate when he says that.
Leslie Knope,I told you that Jamm was a snake.
April Ludgate,"Well, it takes a snake to know a snake."
Leslie Knope,So now I'm a snake?
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,"You deceived me for two straight days, and you eat mice."
Leslie Knope,I don't eat mice.
April Ludgate,"Yes, you do."
April Ludgate,You're a mouse eater.
April Ludgate,Mouse eater.
April Ludgate,Mouse eater.
Ron Swanson,Enough!
Ron Swanson,You are friends and coworkers.
Ron Swanson,"In this office, we treat each other with respect."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, April, how is that dog park coming?"
April Ludgate,"Get out, Jerry."
Ann Perkins,This is private!
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, guys."
Ann Perkins,We are not leaving here until you two figure this out.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, guard the door."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, sir."
Ann Perkins,No one leaves the Octagon.
Ann Perkins,I dated an ultimate fighter.
Ann Perkins,It was like a thing he said.
Andy Dwyer,"What's the play here, officer?"
Andy Dwyer,"You gonna set up a perimeter, maybe bug a few phones?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I know."
Andy Dwyer,"We could put out a dummy computer for them to steal, fill it with explosives first, Boom, take 'em all out."
Extra,"Yeah, we're not doing any of that."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I love your enthusiasm, but we don't really have the kind of money to launch a massive investigation."
Andy Dwyer,You're just gonna fill out this stupid report and that's it?
Andy Dwyer,"As a future cop, you have to understand, I cannot let this guy go."
Extra,"Look, man, this is what most police work is."
Extra,Just writing stuff down.
Extra,It's not superhero time.
Extra,"If it sounds boring, maybe you ought to do something else."
Chris Traeger,Maybe we should find the person who stole his positive attitude.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man."
Tom Haverford,Get any more job offers since I last saw you?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but it was just a management position at Urban Outfitters."
Ben Wyatt,I turned it down.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, man."
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can't hack this.
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, my accounting job isn't boring."
Tom Haverford,"If it was remotely interesting, there would be a show on A&E about it."
Tom Haverford,They have a show about storage unit auctions.
Ben Wyatt,Fair point.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, if you're passionate about this, keep at it."
Ben Wyatt,Things will turn around.
Ben Wyatt,Also can you tell me what time that show about storage units is on?
Tom Haverford,9:30
Ann Perkins,"All right, I'm gonna have to force this."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, maybe you want to admit that you haven't been the greatest role model."
April Ludgate,I don't care.
April Ludgate,Orin's my role model.
Ann Perkins,"April, maybe you want to admit that you've been a little selfish and inconsiderate."
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I ever wanted was for you to show the enthusiasm you showed for your dog park, and, when you did, I blew it."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry that I outsmarted you at every turn.
Ann Perkins,April.
April Ludgate,"And I know I have a lot to learn from you, and I'm sorry that I disrespected your stupid dream."
Ann Perkins,A lot of love in this room.
Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."
April Ludgate,Me too.
Leslie Knope,I love you very much.
April Ludgate,I love you too.
April Ludgate,I don't want to do this in front of her.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Okay, Ann, since you're such a genius, what do we do now?"
Ann Perkins,"Neither of you want Jamm to win, nor do I, because I hate Paunch Burger, but, if there is one in my backyard, I will eat there, like, every night, and that is no good."
Ann Perkins,"So I say we stop playing dirty with each other, and we start playing dirty with Jamm."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,We'll have triple sex with him.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,"It's very uncool, but it's not illegal, technically, but it is a dick move."
April Ludgate,I love it.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Captain."
Andy Dwyer,Status update: My new suspect the dude who runs carpet emporium.
Andy Dwyer,"The way I figure it is, criminals love to wrap things up in rugs."
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, he yelled at me when I tried to unroll 'em all, so"
Chris Traeger,"Andy, while I appreciate your dedication to finding this criminal, I think you might want to take into account what the policeman said."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, gosh, if I can't even investigate bad guys, why become a cop at all?"
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,"When I get bummed out, I take my shirt off because the bad feelings make me feel sweaty."
Andy Dwyer,"You know what, maybe I should bail on being a cop."
Chris Traeger,City Hall needs a new parttime security guard for the weekends.
Chris Traeger,You want to do that?
Chris Traeger,Look at it as a way to feel out whether you want to be a police officer.
Chris Traeger,"But, keep in mind, if you take this job, you must keep your clothes on at all times, even if you get sad."
Andy Dwyer,No deal.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'll do it."
Chris Traeger,That a boy.
Andy Dwyer,I'll do it.
Andy Dwyer,I promise.
Andy Dwyer,"And I get a gun, and I can point it in people's faces."
Chris Traeger,Incorrect.
Jeremy Jamm,Hey.
Jeremy Jamm,What the hell is going on?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,"The dogs are here because there's no dog park in your neighborhood, and the kids are here because there's no human park in your area."
Leslie Knope,They all needed a place to play.
Jeremy Jamm, My front lawn?
April Ludgate," That's right, and they're gonna keep using it until there's an actual park nearby."
Jeremy Jamm," Hey, hey, lady, get that thing off my gnome."
Jeremy Jamm, He is dryhumping my garden gnome.
Jeremy Jamm,Stupid beast.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, we just need a little bit more time to design our park."
Leslie Knope," And, if you plow through and ignore us, this is gonna be your life."
Jeremy Jamm, I'll call the police.
Ann Perkins," Yeah, sic the police on a bunch of kids and puppies."
Ann Perkins,That's a great photo op.
Jeremy Jamm,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm, Gentleman's agreement.
Jeremy Jamm," In 90 days, we'll put our plans to a vote."
Jeremy Jamm,Winner take all.
Leslie Knope,Deal.
Jeremy Jamm," Great, now call off the actual dogs."
Jeremy Jamm, I want these kids off my lawn.
Jeremy Jamm, I want that hula hoop off my 'Vette.
Jeremy Jamm, Right now.
Leslie Knope," Hey, Jamm."
Leslie Knope, You just got knoped.
Leslie Knope, And ludgated.
Leslie Knope, And perkinsed.
Jeremy Jamm,Ha-ha.
Jeremy Jamm, Nice try.
Jeremy Jamm, It didn't work.
Jeremy Jamm, You just got jammed.
Leslie Knope," Okay, so let's get to work."
Ann Perkins," Wait, wait, wait, do you never just take a second to enjoy things?"
Leslie Knope,"I just said, ""let's get to work."""
Leslie Knope,How else do people enjoy things?
Barney,"I know you changed your mind the last time we offered you a job, but we are just thrilled that you changed it again."
Ben Wyatt, Thank you.
Ben Wyatt, Me too.
Barney, This is our best office.
Barney," As you can see through the window, you have a great view of the billing department."
Barney,"Hey, Sharon!"
Extra, Shh.
Barney, Sorry.
Barney, She's fun.
Barney," So, please, if there's anything we can do to make you happier in your new job, just let me know."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, no, this is great, Barney."
Ben Wyatt, Thank you.
Ben Wyatt, But I have to quit again.
Barney, What
Barney, ohh! Is this a classic Ben joke?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt, I'm really sorry.
Ben Wyatt, But I just don't want to do this.
Ben Wyatt, I need to move my life in another direction.
Barney, This is disappointing.
Barney, Again.
Barney, Maybe someday we'll figure out the magic formula that gets you to work here.
Ben Wyatt," Well, formulas are my formula for moolah."
Barney," Ted, get in here! Ben's quitting again, but you gotta hear what he said."
Ben Wyatt," Leslie's been saying for weeks I should do something I love, and she's right."
Ben Wyatt, And I'll help Tom or maybe try to do that TV thing or maybe work for the Sweetums foundation.
Ben Wyatt, I don't know.
Ben Wyatt, Life is short.
Ben Wyatt," Why be an accountant, you know? I mean, other than the stability and the health plan and the above-average pay."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, God, this better work out."

Extra,"Support for Pawnee Community Radio comes from listeners like you and from the new film The Shadows of Seven Heads, the dramic tale of an Israeli soldier who falls in love with conjoined Palestinian sextuplets."
Extra,Out soon from Focus Features.
Derry Murbles,"Welcome to ""Thought For Your Thoughts."""
Derry Murbles,"I'm your host Derry Murbles, sitting in for Nina Joplin, who is touring the country performing a spokenword opera about pearshaped women."
Derry Murbles,My guest today is City Councilwoman Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"It is a pleasure to be back, Derry."
Leslie Knope,Your show last week on dolphin lactation was just riveting radio.
Leslie Knope,"Derry, my team and I are trying to build a park, and we need input on the design from you, the citizens of Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,So I guess I'm here to send out the Bat Signal.
Derry Murbles,"A Bat Signal, for listeners who might not know, refers to the children's character ""the Bat Man"" a strong gentleman who fights crime nocturnally."
Leslie Knope,That's correct.
Leslie Knope,Well put.
Leslie Knope,This park is going to be a celebration of Pawnee by Pawnee and for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, send in your plan or your resume And quick."
Leslie Knope,Please.
Leslie Knope,Hurry.
Leslie Knope,This is all gonna fall apart if you don't hurry.
Derry Murbles,"Coming up after the break, movie reviews with Ken Tucker who is filling in for David Bianculli who's in New York filling in for Ken Tucker."
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, would you like to introduce the next segment?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"""Now it's time for 'Jazz Plus Jazz Equals Jazz, ' ""today we have a recording of Benny Goodman played over a separate recording of Miles Davis."""
Derry Murbles,Research shows that our listeners love jazz.
Leslie Knope,"All right, so this is a letter from what looks like a federal penitentiary."
Leslie Knope,"""Here's a model of what I thought the park could look like."
Leslie Knope,"Also, I'm innocent."
Leslie Knope,"Please find me a lawyer."""
Leslie Knope,I'm getting kind of worried.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, we have not received one usable idea so far."
Ben Wyatt,Hang on.
Ben Wyatt,Look at this guy.
Ben Wyatt,"""30 years of experience ""with a degree in architecture from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen."""
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Beautiful fountain.
Leslie Knope,Perfectly manicured shrubbery.
Leslie Knope,This is like Parks Department porn.
Leslie Knope,This guy is great.
Leslie Knope,I don't care if he's some junkie war criminal pimp.
Leslie Knope,I am not gonna change my mind.
Ben Wyatt,His name's Wreston St. James.
Ben Wyatt,He's from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I've changed my mind."
Leslie Knope,"I'm not being melodramatic when I say that people from Eagleton are snobby and evil, and they look down on Pawnee, and they would most likely exterminate everyone who isn't from Eagleton if they weren't so busy being obsessed with themselves."
Leslie Knope,"God, that was close."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes when I rant about Eagleton, I forget to breathe, and I pass out."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We cannot have someone from Eagleton design a park for Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,We have had a blood feud that has lasted for 200 years.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we don't have a lot of time, and he is the first decent candidate."
Ben Wyatt,So let's at least go meet the guy.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's a good idea."
Leslie Knope,Then we can reject him face to face.
Leslie Knope,I like your plan.
Tom Haverford,"Friends, former lovers, acquaintances, Jerry, I introduce you to the future home of RentASwag!"
Ann Perkins,Yikes.
Tom Haverford,"Much like women in '90s standup comedy routines, Tommy be shopping."
Tom Haverford,I started a business where I rent my fancy clothes to teens so their parents don't have to buy them nice things they'll just grow out of.
Tom Haverford,"So if you see a 14 year old kid wearing a Louis Vuitton cravat, you know who to thank."
Tom Haverford,Me.
Tom Haverford,And Louis Vuitton for making some dopeass cravats.
Ron Swanson,"Son, I love wildlife, but is a store the best place for it?"
Jerry Gergich,Help.
Tom Haverford,"The place needs some work, but this is a great location."
Tom Haverford,"Lots of foot traffic, no metered parking."
Tom Haverford,And it's well within my fiscal range.
Donna Meagle,"Good use of the word fiscal, Tommy very upscale."
Chris Traeger,Very impressive.
Chris Traeger,Watching you gives me faith that anyone can reinvent themselves.
Tom Haverford,Tommy Timberlake is dead.
Tom Haverford,Long live Thomas M.
Tom Haverford,"Haverford, responsible tycoon."
Jerry Gergich,Help.
Jerry Gergich,I can't move.
Leslie Knope,He designed this place?
Leslie Knope,What a dump.
Wreston St. James,Ben!
Wreston St. James,Leslie.
Wreston St. James,Hi!
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Wreston St. James,Wreston St. James.
Wreston St. James,Thank you so much for coming.
Ben Wyatt,"No, thank you."
Wreston St. James,"Well, what do you think of our newest park?"
Leslie Knope,Eh.
Leslie Knope,"In a word, underwhelming."
Leslie Knope,And a little inconvenient.
Leslie Knope,There's no trash cans anywhere.
Leslie Knope,"What am I supposed to do with my garbage,  just throw it on the ground?"
Extra,"Oh, hey."
Extra,Thank you for the trash!
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, I have to say,  this park is incredible."
Wreston St. James,Thank you.
Wreston St. James,"Its official name is ""Five Mile Grounds"", but we like to call it ""Wide smiles abound."""
Ben Wyatt,Because of all the smiles that occur?
Leslie Knope,It's so boring.
Wreston St. James,"Come on, I'll take you guys on a little tour."
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,He seems super cool.
Leslie Knope,He seems cool.
Leslie Knope,Just you wait.
Leslie Knope,"Well, they always wine and dine you first, but the fact of the matter is Eagletonians are, without exception, snobby, condescending jerks."
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee side of our border with Eagleton And this is the Eagleton side.
Andy Dwyer,Ah.
Andy Dwyer,Uhh.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, babe, it's me."
Andy Dwyer,"Will you come down here, please, and keep me company?"
Andy Dwyer,I'm so bored.
Andy Dwyer,I need you.
April Ludgate,"If I come down there, can I at least break something?"
Andy Dwyer,"Of course, baby."
Andy Dwyer,Anything.
Andy Dwyer,You know that.
Andy Dwyer,Chris gave me this great job as a weekend security guard at City Hall.
Andy Dwyer,Only one problem it's a terrible job.
Andy Dwyer,"I did everything I was supposed to do, and I walked around the building four times."
Andy Dwyer,Only 20 minutes has gone by.
Andy Dwyer,Ugh!
Andy Dwyer,Thought maybe ten minutes had gone by since I started talking.
Andy Dwyer,It's only been 15 seconds.
Andy Dwyer,"Ohh Oh, babe, thank God you're here."
Andy Dwyer,"I got so bored, I started thinking about existence ""Do I matter?"""
Andy Dwyer,Do any of us?
Andy Dwyer,"Is there a master plan in the works, a grand design?"
Andy Dwyer, Just dumb stuff like that.
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,Who cares?
Andy Dwyer,I thought being a security guard would be exciting.
Andy Dwyer,Nope.
April Ludgate,Wait a minute.
April Ludgate,Isn't this how all great Bert Macklin cases start?
April Ludgate,It's quiet.
April Ludgate,A little too quiet.
Wreston St. James,"As you can see, we like to keep things quite immaculate."
Wreston St. James,I remember when Pawnee had that massive sewage overflow in Circle Park whatever happened with that?
Leslie Knope,We totally fixed it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, except for the smell."
Ben Wyatt,The scientists think it's going to linger for another 40 years.
Leslie Knope,Can we just cut to the chase here?
Leslie Knope,Why would a fancy Eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny Pawnee park?
Wreston St. James,"Well, I heard your plea on the radio, and you were so passionate about the project."
Wreston St. James,It doesn't matter if it's a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park.
Wreston St. James,It's about the people.
Wreston St. James,We're here to serve them.
Extra,"Hey, Mr. St. James!"
Wreston St. James,"Oh, our balloon artisan is out of balloons."
Wreston St. James,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,I have chills.
Ben Wyatt,Look at my arm.
Leslie Knope,Why are you so charmed by him?
Leslie Knope,You're like a Southern belle when Rhett Butler comes around.
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Rhett Butler.
Ben Wyatt,That's who he reminds me of.
Ben Wyatt,Or Bono!
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No one from Eagleton has ever wanted to help anyone from Pawnee for any reason.
Leslie Knope,"In 1988, we were hit by a tornado."
Leslie Knope,"We asked Eagleton for help, and they claimed they weren't home."
Leslie Knope,An entire town claimed they weren't home.
Leslie Knope,I don't trust that guy for a second.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, look what Wreston commissioned from the balloon artisan."
Ben Wyatt,It's us.
Tom Haverford,"Great work, team."
Tom Haverford,"Donna, you and your work are ravishing, as usual."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, great organizational skills."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Genuine praise.
Tom Haverford,It's a tip I picked up from Lee Iacocca's autobiography.
Tom Haverford,A small connection between you and your workers helps build loyalty.
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Tom Haverford,How's the old ticker?
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, uh, the rehab is grueling"
Tom Haverford,Great!
Tom Haverford,Glad to hear it.
Tom Haverford,"Yo, Roomba, drop a beat!"
Tom Haverford,RentASwag is gonna be the opposite of Entertainment720.
Tom Haverford,This is my last chance.
Tom Haverford,"If this goes down in flames, I will have nothing except my looks."
Tom Haverford,I could always pimp myself out to hot older ladies.
Tom Haverford,I need to remember that.
Leslie Knope,"May, 1817."
Leslie Knope,"A scrappy group of frontiersmen and women arrive at a hardscrabble chunk of land and call it Pawnee, Indiana."
Wreston St. James,We owe them a debt of gratitude.
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"June, 1817, the richest among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like cowards to form Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Recognize any of your ancestors among the meanies?
Wreston St. James,"Actually, like most people from the area, I have ancestors on both sides."
Wreston St. James,That's why I think this rivalry is just a little silly  and selfdefeating.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you may not know this, but Leslie was actually born in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,Do not blame me for the sins of my mother.
Wreston St. James,"Look Ms. Knope, I'm really trying here, but I just don't know if our working together is such a great idea."
Leslie Knope,Oh running away so soon.
Leslie Knope,Typical.
Leslie Knope,"You know, say what you want about Pawneeans, but we never give up."
Ben Wyatt,"We have a mural called ""The Many Surrenders of Pawnee."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look who's paying attention to me now!"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Can I speak to you privately for a minute?
Andy Dwyer,The name is special agent Bert Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"Tell me who you are, who you work for, and don't bother trying to lie to me, because I'm amazing."
April Ludgate,"My name is Judy Hitler, and I am the spoiled only daughter of Adolf."
April Ludgate,"And I'm going to tell my Daddy you were mean to me, Bert Macklin."
April Ludgate,He's not going to like it very much.
April Ludgate,So untie me!
Andy Dwyer,"Nice try, Miss Hitler, but you have something that I want."
Andy Dwyer,Where's the necklace with all of Germany's war secrets?
April Ludgate,I don't know what you are talking about.
Andy Dwyer,I think you do!
April Ludgate,I don't!
Andy Dwyer,"Now, you give me that war ending necklace, or I will resort to torture."
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"I will show you where it is, damn it."
April Ludgate,"You're too good, Macklin."
Andy Dwyer,"Don't you do it, Hitler."
Andy Dwyer,Don't you dare fall in love with me.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Hitler, you sexy bastard."
Andy Dwyer,No!
April Ludgate,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,MmMm!
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Chris Traeger,I am just filled to the brim with questions.
Chris Traeger,Why are you using this wood?
Chris Traeger,Is it more pliable?
Chris Traeger,What are these metal latches?
Chris Traeger,Are they copper or brass?
Chris Traeger,Is one better?
Chris Traeger,"And if so, why?"
Ron Swanson,"If I tell you, then you won't have learned anything."
Chris Traeger,Another in a long line of lessons from the great Ron Swanson.
Chris Traeger,"My therapist, Dr."
Chris Traeger,"Richard Nygard, suggested that I try some non exercise based hobbies."
Chris Traeger,So I've been studying woodworking with Ron.
Chris Traeger,I made this.
Chris Traeger,"Before I started, it was bigger."
Ron Swanson,Here.
Ron Swanson,I have designed something very important.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you start work on that right away?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, sir!"
Ron Swanson,It's a flight of stairs that leads to nowhere.
Ben Wyatt,Were you listening to him when he was talking about serving the public and making our communities better?
Ben Wyatt,"You know who he sounds like, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Idi Amin.
Leslie Knope,Or Lord Voldemort.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,You.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you've been very rude to him, and you need to apologize."
Leslie Knope,Ha ha ha.
Leslie Knope,"You are a laugh riot, Ben."
Leslie Knope,I am never going to apologize to someone from Eagleton.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,So you can kiss your park and four years of work goodbye.
Ben Wyatt,Up to you.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Ben Wyatt,You can do it.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to.
Ben Wyatt,You can You can do it.
Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, this has been a strange day."
Ben Wyatt,But we wouldn't want to leave you with the wrong impression of Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,Have you guys seen Hitler?
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, we would love to have you design the park, and in the spirit of reconciliation, Leslie would like to apologize."
Leslie Knope,"I may have allowed my prejudices, my totally legitimate prejudices against Eagleton affect my feelings towards your involvement in this project, and so therefore, I would like to say that I'm I'm I'm Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,That's not what I want to say.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,My mouth is kinda dry.
Leslie Knope,My mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,This is Canada Dry.
Leslie Knope,Drink Canada Dry if your mouth is dry.
Leslie Knope,That's nothing.
Leslie Knope,What I want to say is I'm s I'm sor I'm sor
Leslie Knope,He's a human being.
Leslie Knope,You're a human being.
Leslie Knope,You can just just say I'm sor
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that I I'm sorry, very sorry, that I was rude."
Leslie Knope,It's too soon.
Wreston St. James,"You know what, as a gesture of good will, I'd like to waive my fee."
Wreston St. James,I'll design the park pro bono.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,That's very nice of you.
Wreston St. James,I've been working up a little model of the design.
Wreston St. James,"Why don't I bring it over, and we can all go through it together."
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,And then you can come to our wedding.
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Wreston St. James,What?
Ben Wyatt,"It's in May, and we haven't planned it yet, but save the date."
April Ludgate,I was never here.
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
April Ludgate,Aah!
Tom Haverford,"Well done, team."
Tom Haverford,What do you think of the place?
Ann Perkins,Do you really like this yellow paint?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I know it was on sale, but it looks a lot like dried phlegm."
Donna Meagle,"For real, Tom."
Donna Meagle,This place is sad.
Donna Meagle,I think one of the mannequins tried to commit suicide.
Chris Traeger,"I think what's important is we all had a goal, and we achieved it."
Ann Perkins,So you like the place?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, it's quite terrible."
Tom Haverford,This is the best I can do for now.
Tom Haverford,And I'm $46 under budget.
Tom Haverford,Now I have a small treat for you guys for all your hard work.
Tom Haverford,Pizza party!
Jerry Gergich,One small pizza for all of us.
Jerry Gergich,With no toppings.
Tom Haverford,"Cheese is a topping, Jerry."
Tom Haverford,"And why are these lights blaring, by the way?"
Tom Haverford,Does someone here own stock in the electric company?
Ron Swanson,"If there were more food and fewer people, this would be a perfect party."
Andy Dwyer,"You can't run, Hitler."
Andy Dwyer,82nd airborne is everywhere!
Andy Dwyer,History channel.
Andy Dwyer,Ho ho ho!
Andy Dwyer,What is this?
Andy Dwyer,"A child spy, sent to steal the necklace?"
Andy Dwyer,"Bert Macklin, FBI!"
Andy Dwyer,Freeze!
Extra,I didn't do anything!
April Ludgate,"Yeah, bad call, Bert."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, I'm just kidding, buddy."
Andy Dwyer,I'm just playing around.
Andy Dwyer,My name's really Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,I'm a security guard.
Andy Dwyer,What's your name?
Extra,Joey.
Extra,"I was with my mom, and I got lost."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, gosh, don't worry about that."
Andy Dwyer,"I've gotten lost here about 500 times, and I work here."
Andy Dwyer,"What do you say we go find your mom, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,She's not in there.
Andy Dwyer,I'll bet.
Andy Dwyer,Let's try this way.
Extra,Hello?
Extra,"Ms. Knope, Mr. Wyatt?"
Extra,We're from Wreston St. James' firm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Where's Wreston?
Extra,He's on his way.
Extra,He wanted us to get started.
Ben Wyatt,Aw!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I guess go ahead."
Extra,"We present the Crown Jewel of Pawnee containing the sights, sounds, and most importantly, smells that define your city."
Extra,There are several drool buckets for your more slackjawed citizens.
Extra,We also have food troughs full of cheeseburgers and public showers with instructions for those who've never showered before.
Leslie Knope,You have five seconds to get out of here Or I will rip your throats out.
Ben Wyatt,Out.
Ben Wyatt,Now.
Extra,"Oh, hey, my backyard is bigger than your park."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, stay back, stay back."
Leslie Knope,"I told you that Eagletonians are awful, terrible people."
Leslie Knope,They call their boogers Pawnee caviar.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm on your side, and I'm furious too."
Ben Wyatt,But this just doesn't make sense to me.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm gonna talk to Wreston, and I'm gonna get to the bottom of this."
Leslie Knope,Any excuse to talk to Wreston.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am gonna think about a revenge plan."
Leslie Knope,I know what we're gonna do.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna find out where he lives.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna drive to his house.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna set it on fire and watch it burn.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we can't do that."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,We can't.
April Ludgate,"All right, so"
April Ludgate,Does this look familiar?
Andy Dwyer,"No, not at all."
April Ludgate,I was talking to Joey.
Extra,Joey!
Extra,Mommy!
Extra,There you are.
Extra,"Oh, God, I was so worried."
Extra,Thank you so much.
Extra,You'll never know how much I appreciate it.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, just doing my job, ma'am."
Extra,"Thank you for saving me, Andy."
Extra,"Thank you, too, miss Hitler."
Extra,What?
April Ludgate,Don't worry about it.
April Ludgate,Wow.
April Ludgate,You made those losers very happy.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I didn't."
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin did.
April Ludgate,No
Andy Dwyer, FBI.
April Ludgate,"Actually, Bert Macklin kinda made that little boy cry."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, he's a rogue agent who refuses to play by the rules."
April Ludgate,"Seriously, I think Andy Dwyer makes a better real cop than Bert Macklin."
April Ludgate,Maybe it's time for Bert Macklin to hang up his shades.
Extra,Can I get you something to drink?
Ben Wyatt,"Iced tea, please."
Ben Wyatt,"And can I ask you, how are there palm trees here?"
Extra,"Well, Eagleton lies on top of a hot spring which creates a microclimate zone."
Extra,We are truly blessed.
Wreston St. James,"God, I'm so sorry I'm late."
Ben Wyatt,"What the hell happened, man?"
Wreston St. James, I had nothing to do with that stupid prank.
Wreston St. James," In fact, that's why I'm late."
Wreston St. James," I was firing the two people who were responsible, and I was escorting them out of the building."
Ben Wyatt, Well Good!
Wreston St. James,"Full disclosure, Certain people in the firm wanted to promote them, but I insisted they be fired."
Ben Wyatt," If you swear to me that you're serious, maybe we can salvage this."
Wreston St. James, I would really love to.
Wreston St. James, But what about Leslie? I just doubt that she can ever get over the bad blood between our towns.
Ben Wyatt, I think you're wrong.
Ben Wyatt, Leslie is a very forgiving person.
Leslie Knope," Revenge! Ha ha hal This is for Pawnee, you buttfaced pompous jerk! Whoo! I love you, Ben."
Leslie Knope, Pawnee forever! You want a stupid tie? I'll give you a stupid tie.
Leslie Knope," Ha ha! Wreston, suck it."
Leslie Knope, Now we're even.
Ben Wyatt, Leslie.
Ben Wyatt, Huh?
Ben Wyatt,"He didn't do it, and he fired the people who did."
Tom Haverford," Attention, please."
Tom Haverford," I've been going over the books, and I'm missing 9 dollars."
Tom Haverford," Now, I'm not angry at whoever took it."
Tom Haverford, Just come forward.
Tom Haverford," You'll be served with a lawsuit, and we will move on with our lives."
Ann Perkins," Hey, buddy, let's go get some breakfast, okay?"
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Tom Haverford," It was your idea, so you're paying."
Tom Haverford, You're driving.
Tom Haverford, I'm not chipping in for gas.
Ann Perkins, Okay.
Ann Perkins, All right.
Tom Haverford, I'll have the pancake breakfast.
Tom Haverford," Oh, let me also get 12 eggs, uncooked, and some toast."
Tom Haverford,"20 slices, untoasted, in a row in a bag."
Extra, You want a carton of eggs and a loaf of bread.
Ann Perkins," Yeah, just the pancake breakfast is fine."
Tom Haverford, Don't offer to pay if you're gonna be cheap.
Ann Perkins," Listen, man, I know you don't want to repeat the mistakes of Entertainment 720, and that's great, but you're gonna need a little bit of the old Tom to make this business work."
Tom Haverford, No.
Tom Haverford, That Tom ruined everything.
Ann Perkins," Yes, he did, and that Tom made you a horrible boyfriend and a terrible employee and drove you to bankruptcy."
Tom Haverford, Are we nearing the point?
Ann Perkins,"But your swagger and your showmanship and your confidence is part of you, and in small doses, it can help."
Ann Perkins, You can't have RentASwag without the swag.
Tom Haverford, I barely have enough cash to get everything set up.
Ann Perkins, I know.
Ann Perkins, Take this.
Ann Perkins, We all chipped in.
Ann Perkins, Use it to spruce up the store.
Ann Perkins, And in return you can give us like one share of stock in the company.
Tom Haverford, Like a mini public offering.
Tom Haverford," ""Smort"", Ann."
Tom Haverford, Smort.
Tom Haverford, This is a cause for celebration.
Tom Haverford," Waiter! Eight strips of bacon, uncooked, in a sealed package."
Wreston St. James," I call it the Pawnee Commons, a celebration of Pawnee's history and people."
Leslie Knope," A Wamapoke themed playground Food trucks from local restaurants, Li'l Sebastian fountain."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's perfect."
Wreston St. James,Thank you.
Leslie Knope, I can't see myself fighting you on more than 60% of these ideas.
Wreston St. James,I'd expect no less.
Wreston St. James, I'm just glad you like it.
Wreston St. James, I've never met two people more passionate about their hometown.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, I'm actually from Minnesota."
Wreston St. James, Why do you know so much about Pawnee?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm in love with a woman from here."
Ben Wyatt," A strange, passionate, goof ball of a woman."
Leslie Knope, Me.
Leslie Knope, He's in love with me.
April Ludgate," I'm sorry to see you go, Macklin."
April Ludgate," You didn't always play by the rules, but damn it, you were a hell of an agent."
Andy Dwyer, Today I say goodbye to the only life I've ever known.
April Ludgate," Well, some of the boys chipped in and we got you This."
April Ludgate," It isn't much, but it's something to remember us by."
Andy Dwyer,40 years undercover.
Andy Dwyer, I never even met my family.
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,And this is all I have to show for it? Totally worth it.
April Ludgate," It's been a pleasure serving with you, son."
Andy Dwyer," If you ever need me, you know where to find me, In bed next to you, probably having sex with you."
Tom Haverford, Welcome to the new new RentASwag now with 30% more swag.
Tom Haverford," I used the money you guys gave me to add a little flair, and I took everything I own in my house and brought it here, except for my bed."
Tom Haverford, I basically live here now.
Ron Swanson," I hate all of this, which probably means it's good for your business."
Chris Traeger," Ron, my woodworking project, it's for displaying shoes!"
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson, That was always the plan.
Tom Haverford," All right, RentASwag team, I have one more little surprise for you pizza party! Part Two."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, wow! Two pizzas."
Ann Perkins, And toppings!
Tom Haverford,Only on half.
Tom Haverford, I'm not Zuckerberg.

Diane Lewis,"Oh, yeah."
Diane Lewis,He's not a big sharer.
Diane Lewis,I don't even know what his middle name is.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's Ulysses."
Diane Lewis,I can see why he didn't tell me that.
Ron Swanson,"Mary, mother of God."
Ron Swanson,That's Christian Becksvoort!
Ron Swanson,He's the modern master of the Shaker style.

April Ludgate,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Mine was The time he slipped on a cinnabon and landed in a bunch of garbage.
April Ludgate,My favorite Jerry moment was when he ate a bowl of glue.
Andy Dwyer,My favorite Jerry moment is when you switched out his potato soup with glue and he didn't know.
Andy Dwyer,"You're so cute when you're bullying, babe."
Donna Meagle,You know what?
Donna Meagle,Ann was right.
Donna Meagle,This is mean.

Diane Lewis,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Smart, funny, independent, and sexy?"
Leslie Knope,Diane Lewis?
Leslie Knope,More like Diane Sawyer.
Donna Meagle,Whoa!
Donna Meagle,What is going on at the Gergiches?
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,Jerry's having a Christmas party!
Tom Haverford,I can't believe he didn't invite us.
Tom Haverford,How dare he!
Tom Haverford,What'd we ever do to him?
Andy Dwyer,It's probably just family.
April Ludgate,And Ben and Chris.
Andy Dwyer,And Ann.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even know she knew Jerry.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,The Gergiches really go all out.
Ben Wyatt,This is incredible.
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,This is literally the best nonfat eggnog I've ever had.
Ben Wyatt,"Remain calm, but I think you just drank some of the regular, full fat eggnog."
Ben Wyatt,"Chris, one cup won't kill you."
Chris Traeger,"No, but it will add exactly 440 calories."
Chris Traeger,But you know what?
Chris Traeger,I'm fine.
Chris Traeger,You only live once.
Chris Traeger,Mmm!
Chris Traeger,"I don't know if you know this, but things with fat in them taste way better than things with no fat."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Chris everybody knows that."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, guess why my thumbs are up."
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,Because I'm giving you my 100% approval about Diane.
Leslie Knope,She is perfect for you.
Leslie Knope,She gets you.
Leslie Knope,"She is at the bar right now ordering a Lagavulin, neat for you."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, she's even putting up with all this stupid, boring woodworking stuff."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, but, you know, it's not the Super Bowl, guys."
Leslie Knope,Let's take it down a notch.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, you have my approval."
Ron Swanson,I don't need your approval.
Leslie Knope,But you have it.
Ron Swanson,Don't need it.
Leslie Knope,But you got it.
Leslie Knope,This could end up being the best night in Ron Swanson's life.
Leslie Knope,"I am so, so happy for him"
Tammy 2,"Hello, you gorgeous craftsmen."
Tammy 2,"Wow, look at this room."
Tammy 2,"So much wood, ready to be worked."
Leslie Knope,[Bleep] me!
Leslie Knope,"Alert alert, alert, alert."
Ron Swanson,"She's here, isn't she?"
Tammy 2,"Oh, hey, Ron."
Tammy 2,What a coincidence.
Tammy 2,"Gosh, I never dreamed you'd be here."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, this is Diane."
Ron Swanson,"Diane, this is a piece of human garbage named Tammy, who is also my exwife."
Tammy 2,Twice exwife.
Tammy 2,We were married twice.
Leslie Knope,And divorced twice.
Leslie Knope,Everything is done.
Leslie Knope,They are totally done.
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, what are you doing here?"
Tammy 2,"Oh, I just have a little something I need to get drilled."
Leslie Knope,Can I speak with you for a moment?
Leslie Knope,"Everything's fine, we're just gonna chat."
Leslie Knope,"Shouldn't you be at the library, forcing people to borrow books?"
Tammy 2,"Leslie, you and I both know that the library closes at 3:00 p.m."
Leslie Knope,Of course it does.
Tammy 2,"Besides, I like to keep tabs on Ron."
Leslie Knope,So you can ruin his life?
Tammy 2,"So I can have fun with him, and sometimes ruining his life can be a part of that, sure."
Leslie Knope,"This may be the hardest challenge yet for Leslie Knope, emotional guardian."
Leslie Knope,"I need to protect a sweet couple from a sex crazed demon librarian who makes me question my stance on using the ""B"" word."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, maybe just this once."
Leslie Knope,"No, Leslie, fight it."
Leslie Knope,Fight it.
April Ludgate,It looks warm in there!
April Ludgate,Warm and happy.
Donna Meagle,"Mm, look at that gingerbread man."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I don't see any gingerbread cookies.
Donna Meagle,"I'm talking about that jackedup, light skinned dude."
Donna Meagle,Look like Blake Griffin.
Andy Dwyer,You guys!
Andy Dwyer,There's a buffet in the house!
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even know you could do that!

Ann Perkins,"Well, well, well."

Ann Perkins,And why is that?
April Ludgate,"I need a place to deliver this baby, Ann."
April Ludgate,It's coming out of me right now.
April Ludgate,I'm pregnant.
Ann Perkins,This is a lovely party thrown by a lovely man and his lovely family.
Ann Perkins,There's no place for meanies.
April Ludgate,"Aw, forget it, I'm coming in."
April Ludgate,Ow!
April Ludgate,Get off me.
Ann Perkins,Wait.
Ann Perkins,"You're so weak, really?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, I'm barely even doing anything."
Ann Perkins,Are you iron deficient?
Ann Perkins,Let me look at your palm.
April Ludgate,Ow.
April Ludgate,"It's because of your man strength, Man Perkins."
Tom Haverford,"Let us in, Ann."
Tom Haverford,"It's cold outside, and I can't wear mittens 'cause they're unflattering to my hands."
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, guys."
Ann Perkins,This is your penance.
Ann Perkins,You can come in if you do something nice for Jerry.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I already did something nice for Jerry."
Donna Meagle,I drove here to take him to Jerry Dinner.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Donna."
Ann Perkins,You can come in.
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,What about us?
Tom Haverford,What?
April Ludgate,Donna!
Donna Meagle,"Merry critches, bitches!"

Tammy 2,"Oh, my gosh."
Tammy 2,What a coinkydinky.
Tammy 2,"Look, we're sitting at the same table!"
Leslie Knope,"Tammy, this table is reserved."
Tammy 2,A guy traded me his seat for a peek and a squeeze.
Tammy 2,"That's my boob and my butt, respectively."
Tammy 2,"Remember that, Ron?"
Diane Lewis,Subtle.
Extra,"Well, you know, they asked me if I would host this event, and I said, ""Would I?"""

April Ludgate,I'm going to call a cab.
Tom Haverford,Why does everyone act like Jerry's the victim here?
Tom Haverford,He's the one that didn't invite us to his Christmas party.
Tom Haverford,Jerry Filter!
April Ludgate,Jerry Filter!
Andy Dwyer,Who's Jerry Filter?
Tom Haverford,"Unsurprisingly, Jerry sends a lot of annoying emails."
Tom Haverford,"So a while ago, I put a filter on all our accounts."
Tom Haverford,Everything from Jerry goes directly to spam.
Tom Haverford,and Here's our invitation.
April Ludgate,There's three years of nice messages on here.
April Ludgate,"""Congratulations on your wedding."""
April Ludgate,I'm rooting for you kids.
April Ludgate,Jerry.
Tom Haverford,"""Hope you have the best birthday, Tom."""
Andy Dwyer,I just tied my high score in Snake.
Extra,"Our next award is for ""Achievement in Chairs."""
Extra,"The nominees are: Asa Christiana for chair, Ron Swanson for chair,  H.W. Davenport for chair."
Tammy 2,"So exciting, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron, this is your moment."
Leslie Knope,Tune her out.
Leslie Knope,She's not even here.
Extra,And the winner is Ron Swanson for chair.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Ron Swanson,This award is the only one I'd ever give a damn about.
Ron Swanson,"I made my first chair when I was five, but the quality of the wood was wanting, so when I turned nine, I used my factory wages to purchase some beautiful local walnut."
Ron Swanson,"Uh, thank you for this Uh, this all good night good."
Ron Swanson,Uh There it is.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you're looking at a picture of Millie."
Ben Wyatt,"You want to take off, grab some vegan fries?"
Chris Traeger,She really was delightful.
Chris Traeger,I truly wish her all the best.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, maybe going to therapy 1000 times a week is helping. I mean, if you'd seen that picture a month ago, you would have fallen apart."
Chris Traeger,It's just a picture.
Gayle Gergich,Millie!
Millicent Gergich,"Hi, mom!"
Millicent Gergich,We wanted to surprise you and come home early.
Millicent Gergich,"Oh, hey, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Extra,"Let's take a moment now to remember those woodworkers who are no longer with us, and the beautiful coffins they all designed themselves."
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Diane Lewis,Have you seen Ron?
Diane Lewis,He disappeared after the speech and I can't find him anywhere.
Leslie Knope,Diane ugh.
Leslie Knope,The stuff with Tammy is so complex and weird and gross.
Leslie Knope,It just would probably be better if you let me handle it.
Diane Lewis,I'm not worried about Tammy.
Diane Lewis,"I mean, I'm a middle school vice principal."
Diane Lewis,I deal with hormonal psychopaths all the time.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Diane Lewis,What concerns me is you.
Leslie Knope,You who?
Diane Lewis,You you.
Leslie Knope,You me?
Diane Lewis,You're the one who's been at his side all night.
Diane Lewis,"You're the one who's been protecting him, you're the one who knows all the intimate details of his romantic history with that monster."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you misunderstand."
Leslie Knope,I'm happily engaged.
Diane Lewis,"You and Ron have an intimacy that I just don't understand, so if there is a threat to my relationship with Ron, it's not Tammy."
Diane Lewis,It's you.
Extra,"Okay, folks, fasten your seatbelts."
Extra,It's the big one: Best Desk.
Ron Swanson,Where's Diane?
Ron Swanson,I need her.
Leslie Knope,She left.
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,Tammy ruins everything.
Leslie Knope,"No, she left because of me."
Leslie Knope,She's threatened by our relationship.
Ron Swanson,That's ridiculous.
Ron Swanson,I don't think of you romantically.
Ron Swanson,"You're pro government, you never stop talking, and you have blonde hair."
Ron Swanson,You're my worst nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, one man's ""worst nightmare"" is every other man's ""total package."""
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, I don't think it's about dating."
Leslie Knope, I kind of see where Diane is coming from.
Leslie Knope," We are close friends, and I'm very involved in your life."
Ron Swanson, I wouldn't say we're close.
Leslie Knope," By Swanson standards, we're close."
Leslie Knope, I know when your birthday is.
Ron Swanson, So does BaskinRobbins.
Leslie Knope, I know that you secretly love artichokes and plums.
Ron Swanson,"Keep your voice down, woman! Fine, we're friends."
Ron Swanson, So what do I do? Tammy's waiting for me in my car.
Leslie Knope," I think you should take my car and go get Diane, and I will handle Tammy."
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
Ron Swanson," Protect your eyes, she's a gouger."
Leslie Knope, Good to know.
Millicent Gergich," Chris, I'd like you to meet my fiance, Carl."
Chris Traeger,Well.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, there."
Chris Traeger, Hi.
Chris Traeger, How did you two meet?
Extra,Whitewater rafting.
Millicent Gergich," He was the young rafting instructor all the girls were into, and I was the young rafting instructor all the guys were into And then we got together."
Chris Traeger," Ah, so random, right? What a story! I felt like my heart was whitewater rafting."
Chris Traeger," Well, I won't keep you guys."
Chris Traeger, It's good to see you.
Chris Traeger, Mwah.
Chris Traeger," Oh, little tip, there is fat in the eggnog."
Millicent Gergich, Okay.
Ben Wyatt, So how'd it go? You okay?
Chris Traeger,I'm fine.
Chris Traeger," If therapy has taught me anything, it's that I need to face my fears, even when my fears are engaged to a man with the chiseled jawline of a young me."
Chris Traeger," Thank you, Ben."
Ben Wyatt, Thank me?
Ben Wyatt, For what?
Chris Traeger,For looking out for me tonight.
Chris Traeger, You're a good friend.
Ben Wyatt, Hey So Gayle and Jerry I've thought about it a lot.
Chris Traeger, There's no logical explanation.
Tammy 2," Well, hello there, Big"
Tammy 2, Gross! Leslie? Where's Ron?
Leslie Knope,"Too late, Tammy."
Leslie Knope, Ron's gone.
Leslie Knope, You'll never get him back.
Tammy 2, Wanna bet? That relationship is weak.
Tammy 2," All I have to do is find Ron within the next few hours, and he's toast."
Leslie Knope," Few hours, you say?"
Tammy 2,Leslie! Stop this car! Where are we going?
Leslie Knope, I don't know.
Tammy 2, You're gonna regret this!
Ann Perkins,"Well, hello again."
Ann Perkins," You ready to be nice to Jerry? Because it's so cold out here, it reminds me of my wife's lasagna."
April Ludgate, I actually like that one.
Jerry Gergich," Hey, guys! I thought you weren't coming."
Jerry Gergich," I you know, never got your RSVP."
April Ludgate," Hi, Jerry."
April Ludgate, We got you a gift.
April Ludgate, Merry Christmas.
Andy Dwyer," Yeah, just we took up a collection to pay your hospital bills, since you almost farted yourself to death."
Tom Haverford," Every time we did something mean, we put a dollar in a box."
Jerry Gergich, Wow.
Jerry Gergich, I'm the luckiest man on earth.
Jerry Gergich," Okay, well, come on in! It's a party."
Jerry Gergich," Uh Oh, jeez."
Tammy 2,Give me the keys!
Leslie Knope,No!
Tammy 2,Give 'em to me!
Leslie Knope,"Never! Hey, game over, Tammy."
Tammy 2,What?
Tammy 2,You!
Tammy 2, Ah! I'm going in!
Tammy 2,"Oh, my God, I am so turned on right now."
Leslie Knope, What is wrong with you?
Tammy 2,"Oh, yeah, tell me you're not feeling this."
Leslie Knope, You are so crazy!
Tammy 2,I got 'em! I got 'em.
Leslie Knope, No! No!
Tammy 2,Ah! You'll never catch me!
Leslie Knope, Come back here Ow! You are not gonna ruin this night!
Tammy 2, Get away from this car!
Tammy 2,No! What are you doing? You're crazy!
Tammy 2,Ron! Ron!
Leslie Knope,"Ha! You're too late! No! No, no, no, no, no, no!"
Diane Lewis,"She just knows you so well, and I was starting to wonder if I was ever gonna get to that point."
Diane Lewis, I'm worried that maybe there isn't room in your life for another woman.
Ron Swanson," At this very moment, Leslie is throwing herself in front of a freight train named Tammy for me and you."
Ron Swanson," Leslie is a wonderful, loyal friend, who is very important in my life, but I would sooner visit Europe than have something romantic happen between us."
Ron Swanson," Although, if you'd like to visit Europe, I like you so much, I'd be willing to risk it."
Diane Lewis," But not France, right?"
Ron Swanson,"God, no."
Ron Swanson," See? You know me pretty well already, but you're about to get to know me even better."
Ron Swanson," I brought you here because I want to show you something that almost no one knows about certainly not Tammy, and not even Leslie Knope."
Extra," Ladies and gentleman, and especially the ladies, put your hands together for the one, the only, my man, Mr. Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson, A mighty fine holiday evening to you all.
Extra,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,"It might be cold outside, but it's about to get warm all up in my jazz."
Ron Swanson," I, of course, am Duke Silver, and I would like to dedicate this first song To my duchess."
Extra, You're so lucky.
Extra, I'm going to kill you.
Leslie Knope, I think it's time to officially retire as Ron's emotional guardian.
Leslie Knope," That's Diane's job now, and she seems more than up to the task."
Leslie Knope," I mean, I'd do anything for Ron even spend a whole night fighting his crazy ex-wife."
Leslie Knope, But I think I'm safe.
Leslie Knope, She's gotta be tired by now.
Tammy 2, Hi.
Ron Swanson,Officer Skorggel.
Extra, I pulled over a Tammy Swanson for driving erratically.
Extra," Ran the plates, saw it was your car."
Extra, Figured it was stolen.
Tammy 2," Hey, Ron, why don't you get me out of these handcuffs, so I can put you into these handcuffs."
Diane Lewis," Yes, please officer, get her out of those cuffs."
Diane Lewis, I want this to be a fair fight.
Ron Swanson," Officer, did you see any sign of a passenger?"
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Ron Swanson,There we go.
Leslie Knope, Hey!
Leslie Knope,Help.

Ann Perkins,"Mr. Hotate, hi."
Ann Perkins,Thank you for coming.
Ann Perkins,Would you like some water?
Ken Hotate,Water?
Ken Hotate,Like fire water?
Ken Hotate,"That's racist, and I do not appreciate it."
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, no, no."
Ann Perkins,I didn't mean it like that.
Ann Perkins,"I just meant, you know"
Ken Hotate,I'm just messing with you.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,He's funny.
Leslie Knope,This guy's funny.
Leslie Knope,He does that sometimes.
Ken Hotate,But seriously.
Ken Hotate,I'll have a whiskey.
Leslie Knope,"Ken Hotate is the leader of the Wamapoke people, and we are trying to get them involved in our Pawnee Commons project."
Leslie Knope,Ken and I get along great.
Leslie Knope,"But historically, Pawnee's relationship with the Wamapoke has been more Murdery."
Ken Hotate,What about and I'm just spitballing here a large neon advertisement for the Wamapoke casino?
Ken Hotate,"We have a new slogan that I'm quite proud of: ""Our slots are downright filthy."""
April Ludgate,I think it's a slam dunk idea.
April Ludgate,I think we're done here.
Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think we are.
Leslie Knope,I don't know if we could put that in a public park.
Ken Hotate,"In that case, the playground will be great."
Ken Hotate,Why don't we retire to my longhouse and smoke the ceremonial peace pipe to celebrate?
Ann Perkins,Is he joking?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,"Well, well, well."
Ann Perkins,If it isn't Mr. Best Man and Bachelor boy.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, Maid of Honor, are you ready for the bachelorette party?"
Ann Perkins,"Uh, more than ready."
Ann Perkins,"We've got dancing, Jello shots, private karaoke, and anything that can be penis shaped will be penis shaped."
Leslie Knope,Ohhh!
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"As Leslie's maid of honor, I really need her bachelorette party to go well."
Ann Perkins,Which is why I'm stress eating gummy penises.
Leslie Knope,What are you losers doing for your bachelor party?
Chris Traeger,I told Ben he could do whatever he wants.
Chris Traeger,Sky is the limit.
Chris Traeger,"We have Haverford, Swanson, Dwyer Jerry forced his way in there somehow things are bound to get crazy."
Ben Wyatt,The game is Settlers of Catan.
Ben Wyatt,The object is be the first to build a civilization on this fictional island.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe this is what you want to do for your bachelor party.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, guys, we don't have to play this game if you don't want to."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I'm nationally ranked, so it isn't even really fair."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, this is your night."
Chris Traeger,We do what you want to do.
Chris Traeger,"Come on, let's play."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm not a big bachelor party kind of guy, so when the guys asked me what my perfect night would be, I told them the truth beer and board games."
Ben Wyatt,They thought I was kidding.
Ben Wyatt,I was not kidding.
April Ludgate,"Is this gonna be one of those cool bachelorette parties where things get out of control and we murder someone, and then we all have to take a blood oath to never reveal our secret?"
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Then I might have to leave early.
Leslie Knope,What the hell?
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, well, well."
Jeremy Jamm,Don't you ladies look nice For once?
Jeremy Jamm,Just kidding.
Jeremy Jamm,I've actually always been attracted to this one.
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, what the hell are you doing?"
Kathryn Pinewood,We're laying the groundwork for Pawnee's newest restaurant.
April Ludgate,"""Future home of Paunch Burger."
April Ludgate,"Start drooling, fatties""?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, the deal was that both of us had three months to get our proposals together, and then we put it up for a vote."
Leslie Knope,We still have two weeks left.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, that's true."
Jeremy Jamm,"However, here's the problem."
Jeremy Jamm,"Turns out, I don't care."
Jeremy Jamm,You can't stop this train.
Jeremy Jamm,Make all the ruckus you want.
Jeremy Jamm,"By the time this all gets cleared up, the people will be frothing at the mouth for that beef."
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Aw, sweet!"
Bjorn Lerpiss,A new Paunch Burger.
April Ludgate,Their burgers will kill you!
April Ludgate,They're full of wasps!
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Yeah, but they taste real good."
Kathryn Pinewood,"Yes, they do, sir."
Jeremy Jamm,"Once again, open invitation."
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm still technically married, but my wife knows the deal."
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm sorry, what's this?"
Ben Wyatt,"Seven contiguous segments, giving me longest road and a sweetass ten points for the win."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, booyah!"
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,All right.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, come on over here."
Chris Traeger,Gather round.
Chris Traeger,I want to propose a toast.
Chris Traeger,"To our new Lord of Catan, Ben Wyatt, a great friend and a wonderful man."
Chris Traeger,May you and Leslie find eternal happiness together.
Jerry Gergich,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for indulging me.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you want to stick around?"
Ben Wyatt,I got a bunch of Homeland episodes burning a hole in my DVR.
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"On principle, I cannot stand idly by and watch a bachelor party peter out like this."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I know you said no strippers 'cause they make you sad."
Ben Wyatt,Correct.
Tom Haverford,Then let's go get a drink at Essence.
Tom Haverford,It's the hot new bar in Eagleton.
Tom Haverford,Things Magazine said it's the next big thing.
Chris Traeger,"But, Tom, this is Ben's night."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, believe me, if the group's happy, I'm happy."
Jerry Gergich,I'd go.
Andy Dwyer,If you guys spot me.
Andy Dwyer,It sounds expensive.
Tom Haverford,"Just so you know, it's not your typical bar."
Tom Haverford,They specialize in molecular mixology.
Tom Haverford,It's kind of like an experimental new way to consume alcohol.
Ron Swanson,"Son, there's no wrong way to consume alcohol."
Extra,Here's your Bud light.
Andy Dwyer,I ordered a beer.
Extra,That is a beer.
Extra,And here's your Nimbus Martini.
Extra,May I go ahead and chisel your aromasphere?
Tom Haverford,Please!
Ron Swanson,This is the wrong way to consume alcohol.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, that's a pretty stiff cloud."
Extra,Who ordered the Scotch?
Ron Swanson,Right here.
Extra,"Hold out your hands, please."
Ron Swanson,What's happening?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, this is a sort of play on Scotch."
Tom Haverford,It's a whiskey infused lotion.
Ron Swanson,Can I ask if this entire establishment is a practical joke of some kind?
Tom Haverford,"If you don't like the Scotch, they have a vodka that's served in the form of a flash of light."
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins,Having fun?
Leslie Knope,"Well, four years of work down the drain, and I have a penis on my head."
Leslie Knope,Jamm is stealing this lot right out from under us.
Leslie Knope,"My dream is dead, Ann."
April Ludgate,Mine too.
April Ludgate,This is why I prefer nightmares.
Ann Perkins,"You are sad drinking right now, and I need you to be happy drinking."
Ann Perkins,Like when we watch Grease together.
Leslie Knope,"I know, Ann, but everything's gonna disappear."
Leslie Knope,"April's mini dog park, the Li'l Sebastian fountain, even the Wamapoke playground."
Leslie Knope,Yet another piece of Wamapoke land plowed over by the white man.
Ann Perkins,Just try to forget about it.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, there's nothing you can do to stop them tonight."
Leslie Knope,"For almost 200 years, Pawnee repeatedly built factories, restaurants, and other stuff on land held sacred by the Wamapoke people."
Leslie Knope,"So we passed a law saying that if any sacred Wamapoke artifact is found on a development site, all construction must immediately stop."
Leslie Knope,It would be terrible if that were to happen on this future Paunch Burger site.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is bad."
Leslie Knope,I should not have done this.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I wonder who that is."
Ann Perkins,"Well, if it isn't Babe Lincoln!"
Ann Perkins,Imagine that.
Extra,"Hello, ladies."
Extra,I'm Abraham Lincoln.
Extra,Who's the lucky Mary Todd?
Ann Perkins,Right here.
Ann Perkins,Right here.
Donna Meagle,"Ah, ah, ah, me first."
Donna Meagle,Me first.
Extra,"Oh, okay."
Donna Meagle,"All right, tear it up, 16!"
Donna Meagle,Emancipate them abs.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ann, not now."
Ann Perkins,"Come on, Leslie, just loosen up."
Ann Perkins,I know for a fact this is a sex dream you've had.
Extra,Looks like it's time for the Gettysburg undressed!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,And we're gonna have to stop now.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I'm just not in the mood for historical nudity."
Leslie Knope,"Please, Mr. president, put your pants back on."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, can I speak with you privately?"
April Ludgate,Is your name Glenn?
Extra,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I sat behind you in middle school band.
April Ludgate,Do you still play the clarinet?
Extra,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"How have you been, man?"
Tom Haverford,"Man, if I ever have a bachelor party, I am definitely coming back here."
Chris Traeger,You never had one before you were married to Wendy?
Tom Haverford,"No, it was a green card wedding."
Tom Haverford,"I did watch the threeway sex scene from Wild Things a few times the night before, but it didn't really count."
Andy Dwyer,I never had a bachelor party either.
Andy Dwyer,"Me and April, we got married with no warning."
Andy Dwyer,I didn't even have time to take a shower before my wedding.
Andy Dwyer,Or after.
Andy Dwyer,"For, like, a week and a half."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy One forbade me from any kind of celebration, and Tammy Two thwarted me by calling in a bomb threat to the steakhouse."
Jerry Gergich,I didn't have one either!
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, really, it's a funny story."
Jerry Gergich,"So two weeks before I married Gayle, I had an emergency appendectomy."
Tom Haverford,Boop!
Tom Haverford,That's me hitting the snooze button.
Tom Haverford,Don't talk again for another ten minutes.
Chris Traeger,New idea!
Chris Traeger,"Tonight, everyone gets the bachelor party they never had."
Chris Traeger,One activity per bachelor.
Chris Traeger,"Welcome to Tom's bachelor party, held in a white airplane hangar from the ice planet Hoth, replete with dangling, beautiful aerialists."
Chris Traeger,To Tom Haverford.
Ben Wyatt,To Tom Haverford!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, hey and to my bride, Rihanna."
Tom Haverford,We truly did find love in a hopeless place.
Tom Haverford,"Waiter, a round of light flash shots for me and my friends!"
Ben Wyatt,Ohhh!
Tom Haverford,Whoo!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, so what happened?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, I buried a bunch of Wamapoke artifacts in the dirt so that people would find them and have to stop developing at the site."
Leslie Knope,"You know, when I say it out loud, it doesn't sound so bad."
Ann Perkins,"No, that's bad."
Extra,"Yeah, that's pretty uncool."
April Ludgate,"Shut up, Glenn."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm was being sneaky, and then I tried to sneaky him back, and it turned to crummy, and I have to undo it."
Leslie Knope,I need your help.
Ann Perkins,You don't mean 
Leslie Knope,I do.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,I'm not doing that.
April Ludgate,"You guys, the penis hats cut your digging time in half."
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Don't be afraid.
April Ludgate,Use the penises.
Ann Perkins,Bachelorette party.
Ann Perkins,Whoo.
Ann Perkins,Perkins does it again.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, I met Gayle right here at Sherm's."
Andy Dwyer,Mmmm.
Jerry Gergich,She was slender.
Jerry Gergich,"Blonde hair, big breasts, long legs."
Jerry Gergich,"Ugh, not my type at all."
Ben Wyatt,"And what was it, exactly, that led to you two hitting it off?"
Ben Wyatt,"Was she ill, or did your father witness her father committing a crime?"
Ben Wyatt,Or was she temporarily blind
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,"All that matters is that you got married, and you're happy."
Chris Traeger,"So as all time best man, I suggest we raise a cone to Jerry Gergich."
Ben Wyatt,Jerry Gergich.
Tom Haverford,Jerry!
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Gergich.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, jeez."
Extra,"No worries, Gary."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thanks, Sherm."
Ben Wyatt,How did you have that ready so fast?
Extra,I always make a backup cone.
Extra,He drops it about half the time.
Chris Traeger,"Andy, you're next."
Chris Traeger,Any activity in the world.
Chris Traeger,What would you do?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, mine's impossible."
Andy Dwyer,I want to see a Colts game.
Andy Dwyer,"I want to see the Colts beat the Patriots 49 to nothing, then I yell at Tom Brady and make him cry, then I hook up with Dave Matthews, and we play golden tee for ten hours."
Andy Dwyer,Alala baby
Ron Swanson,"that's a very specific dream, son."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Jim, Chris Traeger."
Chris Traeger,I need a favor.
Andy Dwyer,I'm dead.
Andy Dwyer,I am dead.
Andy Dwyer,And this is what heaven is like.
Andy Dwyer,I knew it.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, this is where they play the games!"
Jerry Gergich,"You're up, Andy."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys!"
Chris Traeger,"Guys, come on over here."
Chris Traeger,"Andy, I want you to meet Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay."
Jim Irsay,"Andy, good to meet you, my friend."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,"I love your team, sir."
Andy Dwyer,I love them like they're my own children.
Jim Irsay,"You're big enough to play football yourself, it looks like to me."
Andy Dwyer,"I can't tell if you're joking, but I hope you're not."
Jim Irsay,This whole place is yours.
Chris Traeger,Jim Irsay and I became friends while volunteering to mentor Indianapolis teens.
Chris Traeger,I gave them tours of the state house.
Chris Traeger,Jim gave them Colts tickets and autographed jerseys.
Chris Traeger,They preferred Jim.
Andy Dwyer,Reggie Wayne.
Andy Dwyer,"I can't look at you, Reggie Wayne."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,I got married in your jersey.
Andy Dwyer,That's no joke.
Reggie Wayne,That's weird.
Reggie Wayne,But I respect that.
Jerry Gergich,"I'm a big fan, Mr. Luck."
Andrew Luck,"Okay, guy, settle down."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, Mr. Andrew Luck, it's every groom's dream to catch a touchdown pass thrown by you."
Andy Dwyer,Could you do me the honor?
Andrew Luck,"Yeah, let's do it."
Andy Dwyer,Keep the spiral tight.
Andrew Luck,I'll try.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Touchdown, Dwyer!"
Ben Wyatt,Andy!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,Whoo!
Andrew Luck,See ya!
Tom Haverford,"uh, here I go here I go  here I go again "
Chris Traeger,girls what's my weakness?
Tom Haverford, let's call Ann real quick.
Tom Haverford,Rub it in.
Ann Perkins,Hello?
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Tom Haverford,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,"We're having the time of our lives, and I'm calling you to rub it in!"
Chris Traeger,Whoo!
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Ann Perkins,Really.
Chris Traeger,"We went to an insane bar, played football with the Colts."
Tom Haverford,With the Colts!
Andy Dwyer,The Colts!
Ben Wyatt,Football!
Chris Traeger,Now we're going to a steakhouse.
Chris Traeger,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"Uh, well, we're surrounded by hot guys."
Ben Wyatt,We're surrounded by hot guys.
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Ann Perkins,"Oh, Donna just ripped off a stripper's underwear with her teeth."
Ann Perkins,Whoo!
April Ludgate,"Ann, who are you lying to?"
Ann Perkins,Shh.
Tom Haverford,No!
Extra,Can I take a break?
Extra,My hands are tired.
Donna Meagle,Uhuh.

Ron Swanson,"Gentlemen, welcome to the Steak House of St. Elmo."
Andy Dwyer,Whoo!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ron Swanson,Tonight we eat something's flesh!
Ron Swanson,I want meat!
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, are you sure this is our table?"
Tom Haverford,There's only four settings.
Extra,"Excuse me, sir."
Extra,This is not your table.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I thought you said the Gergich party."
Extra,"No, no, I said the Gingrich party."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry."
Tom Haverford,"Damn it, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,But you know what?
Jerry Gergich,"Gingrich, Gergich."
Jerry Gergich,I wonder if we're related.
Newt Gingrich,"I don't think so, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Extra,"One rare porterhouse, one rare sirloin, and a rasher of bacon."
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Ron Swanson,"It's the lord's work you're doing, John."
Ron Swanson,I'd like four more glasses of Lagavulin in liquid form.
Extra,That's not something you really need to specify.
Ron Swanson,You'd be surprised.
Ben Wyatt,"So, bachelor boy, how's it going with Diane?"
Ron Swanson,Hmm.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna be very candid with you all.
Ron Swanson,I like her.
Chris Traeger,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,Wow!
Chris Traeger,"Okay, okay, okay."
Chris Traeger,"There are so many things that I could say about Ron, but I think that the best man's speech should represent the groom."
Chris Traeger,So I will just say To Ron.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, to Ron!"
Tom Haverford,To Ron!
Ben Wyatt,To Ron.
Ron Swanson,Just perfect.
Ron Swanson,"Perfect, Chris."
Extra,"Here you are, sir."
Extra,And I thought you might also like to know that your meal has already been taken care of  by Mr. Hibbert.
Tom Haverford,What?
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Hey!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, whoa!"
Roy Hibbert,"What's up, Jello shot?"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man."
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
Tom Haverford,Roy Hibbert.
Tom Haverford,Entertainment 720 reunion.
Roy Hibbert,"Hey, Tom."
Roy Hibbert,I am not paying for that guy.
Roy Hibbert,He owes me a lot of money.
Tom Haverford,It's true.
Ann Perkins,Coffee?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, please."
Leslie Knope,"Take extra cream, 30 sugars."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe I tried to exploit the Wamapoke for my own personal gain.
Ann Perkins,"Well, we got most of the artifacts, and even if we didn't, they probably won't find them."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, and if they do, you'll just go to jail."
April Ludgate,"But you can make wine in your toilet and fight people, which is a super cool way to live."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Tweep.
Leslie Knope,I tweeped.
Leslie Knope,I called Tweep.
Jeremy Jamm,"Look, I'm telling the truth here, lady."
Jeremy Jamm,We haven't found any American Indian artifacts.
Jeremy Jamm,Or regular Indian.
Jeremy Jamm,"Japanese, Muslim, Jewish, none of those weird countries."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Weird countries?
Leslie Knope,Shauna MalwaeTweep.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm so glad that you're here."
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,Nothing?
Extra,Found something!
Extra,There's other stuff too.
Extra,"Arrowheads, more pottery."
Extra,I also found some weird looking gummy candy.
Kathryn Pinewood,"All right, shut it down."
Kathryn Pinewood,This is a P.R. nightmare.
Kathryn Pinewood,We can't do anything until the Indian Affairs Commission weighs in.
Jeremy Jamm,This is [Bleep]ing bull[bleep].
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"Lesie, Ken Hotate is right over there, you need to talk to him before the meeting and come clean."
Leslie Knope,He's gonna be so mad.
Leslie Knope,The zodiac killer never confessed.
Leslie Knope,Why do I have to?
April Ludgate,"Leslie, I want the Pawnee Commons as bad as you do."
April Ludgate,"Actually, that's not true."
April Ludgate,You want everything a thousand times more than I do.
April Ludgate,But we do not want to win this way.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, April, I wish you weren't right, but you are."
Leslie Knope,"You have turned into a very beautiful, wise, and fertile government employee."
April Ludgate,Stop.
Ann Perkins,"It's kind of weird when she just starts raining compliments on you, huh?"
April Ludgate,Don't try to bond with me.
Ann Perkins,Can't win.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys, I had these Tshirts made."
Chris Traeger,They're not exactly a summary of the party  we ended up having.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa.
Chris Traeger,But they're a good memento.
Ron Swanson,Madness indeed.
Ben Wyatt,I love this!
Ben Wyatt,Usually you can only get board game tshirts in XXL.
Chris Traeger,I just remembered.
Chris Traeger,We left Jerry back at the gas station in Martinsville.
Chris Traeger,I'll go get him.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that guy's the best."
Tom Haverford,I feel bad he didn't get to have his moment last night.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you know what we should do for him?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, get him a pet snake, but I keep it."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"In 1921, several Wamapoke families were removed from their homes so that Pawnee could install a bumper car track."
Leslie Knope,"In 1951, Pawnee made it illegal for people to, ""Dance or smell like a native American."""
Ken Hotate,Why are you telling me all this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I want to raise the bar of awfulness so that when I confess something to you, you have perspective."
Leslie Knope,Those artifacts found at lot 48 were placed there by me.
Leslie Knope,I wanted to delay construction on the Paunch Burger and buy some more time for my park project.
Ken Hotate, That is not great.
Leslie Knope, It sucks.
Leslie Knope," I'm very, very sorry."
Leslie Knope, I have great respect for the Wamapoke culture.
Leslie Knope, And this isn't even about the Pawnee Commons.
Leslie Knope," I just hope that you can forgive me, Ken."
Ben Wyatt, Hey!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys."
Chris Traeger, What are you doing here?
Ben Wyatt,Congratulations.
Ben Wyatt, You have won the award for Best Man.
Tom Haverford," Full disclosure I voted for Ryan Gosling, but you came in a close second."
Ben Wyatt," Now, you've never been married, so you didn't get your own bachelor party."
Tom Haverford, But let's look ahead.
Tom Haverford, The year is 2018.
Tom Haverford," America is thriving under president Nick Cannon, and tomorrow, Chris Traeger's getting married."
Ron Swanson, Who's the lucky lady? Maybe she's an upbeat gal who's nuts about fitness.
Jerry Gergich, Maybe she owns a juice bar in Snerling.
Andy Dwyer, Maybe it's April.
Andy Dwyer, Maybe I die.
Andy Dwyer, Skydiving explosion.
Andy Dwyer, Pbbbt.
Andy Dwyer, And then you go marry April.
Andy Dwyer," And it makes me sad, but if she's gonna be with somebody, I'd like it to be you."
Andy Dwyer," Strange, but sweet."
Andy Dwyer, Only I didn't really die.
Andy Dwyer, I was faking it.
Andy Dwyer, And I come back.
Andy Dwyer, I spy on you from my red Corvette.
Andy Dwyer," And I'm planning to kick your ass, but I see how happy you make her, and I have to walk away."
Andy Dwyer, I have to.
Andy Dwyer," And I do, slowly."
Andy Dwyer, In a rainstorm.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, this isn't really in the spirit of what we're trying to do."
Andy Dwyer," But as time goes by, it eats away at me."
Andy Dwyer, You're out living it up with my wife.
Andy Dwyer, And I'm alone.
Andy Dwyer, In a cave.
Andy Dwyer, Training.
Ron Swanson, Anyone else want to chime in?
Andy Dwyer, I thought you were my friend.
Andy Dwyer, I thought you were my friend!
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what we're trying to say is that you are a great guy, and someday, you're gonna meet somebody who's into all the same stuff that you are."
Chris Traeger," You know, the old Chris would've loved this super fit health goddess you guys are talking about."
Chris Traeger," But our great adventure reminded me that now I just want someone that values the important things in life, friendships, passion, happiness."
Chris Traeger, And dimples are a plus.
Andy Dwyer," Aw, that's sweet."
Andy Dwyer," I forgive you, bro."
Andy Dwyer, You take care of April.
Ken Hotate," After careful examination, we have determined that these Wamapoke artifacts could not have originated in lot 48."
Jeremy Jamm, Boom.
Jeremy Jamm, Knew it.
Leslie Knope, There's something else.
Leslie Knope, I would like to go on record and say that
Ken Hotate," Hold on, Ms. Knope."
Ken Hotate, Please.
Ken Hotate, I would like to go on record.
Ken Hotate," Speaking as a citizen of Pawnee, I do not like the way you went back on your deal with Councilwoman Knope."
Ken Hotate," It reminds me of what the settlers of Pawnee did to my ancestors, taking their land without permission."
Leslie Knope, He really plays white people like a fiddle.
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, It's amazing to watch.
Ken Hotate, You and Leslie had a deal.
Ken Hotate," If that deal is not restored, well, I believe there are six Paunch Burgers in the Wamapoke casino."
Ken Hotate, Perhaps it's time that we revisited those contracts.
Kathryn Pinewood, Is that a threat?
Ken Hotate,"Why, yes, I thought that was obvious."
Kathryn Pinewood, Take the sign down.
Kathryn Pinewood, We'll wait until everything's official.
Leslie Knope," In the spirit of fair play, I suggest we put on these authentic Wamapoke headdresses and dance around the table."
Jeremy Jamm, Absolutely not.
Jeremy Jamm, That sounds highly offensive.
Ken Hotate," Does it, white man?"
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm, It's not offensive.
Jeremy Jamm, So let's do it.
Ken Hotate,You first.
Jeremy Jamm," So clearly, this is not offensive."
Ken Hotate, It is offensive.
Jeremy Jamm,I am very sorry.
Ken Hotate,Take it off.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," Hey, Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, hey, Shauna."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," So I was chasing this story, but it seems like a dead end."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Then I heard about your crazy rotating bachelor party.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Would you mind if I wrote about it?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt, But is that really news?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,To me it is.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," A group of good friends having fun, doing nice things for each other."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," I mean, that's what's important in life, and I want to write about it."
Ben Wyatt," Hey, Chris."
Chris Traeger, Ben Wyatt.
Chris Traeger, And Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Ben Wyatt," Hey, Shauna's doing a story on our group bachelor party."
Ben Wyatt, She said she wanted to write stories about good people doing nice things for each other.
Ben Wyatt, So I figured you two might have a lot to talk about.
Chris Traeger, You may be right about that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Do you have a second right now?
Chris Traeger,I have thousands of seconds.
Chris Traeger, Would you like to have lunch? Are you a vegetarian? A vegan? A pescatarian? Not that it matters.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," Um, I like burgers."
Chris Traeger, Perfect.
Chris Traeger," Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh! Three, ten, bullock! Three, ten, bullock! Give it to me."
Andy Dwyer," How great a day was today? Oh, God, I could die."
Andy Dwyer, Greatest day of my life.
Andy Dwyer, I met Andrew Luck today.
Andy Dwyer, I met Reggie Wayne today.
Andy Dwyer, And I met Jim Irsay.
Andy Dwyer, I'm standing on the field.
Andy Dwyer, Lucas Oil Stadium.
Andy Dwyer, And I'm playing football with my friends.

Paula Horke,"Well it's a pleasure to be here, ladies."
Paula Horke,I didn't think anybody really cared about my time on the city council.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, we do."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you are such an inspiration."
Leslie Knope,Still going strong at 82.
April Ludgate,How old is that handkerchief?
Paula Horke,"Well, it's not a handkerchief."
Paula Horke,It's a receipt.
Leslie Knope,Paula Horke was Pawnee's first female city councilor a huge inspiration to me.
Leslie Knope,"Women have come a long way in Pawnee, but we still have quite a ways to go."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, technically, I'm not allowed to reserve this conference room without my husband or father's signature."
Paula Horke,Government was a real boys' club back in the '70s.
Paula Horke,"They smoked their cigars, they snapped my bra, wore mirrors on their shoes to look up my skirt."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I am happy to report that it is now a pervert free people's club."
Ann Perkins,"Well, except for Councilman Dexhart, who's a selfdescribed pervert."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, and didn't Milton try to kiss you?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, things aren't perfect."
Paula Horke,All the other councilmen used to keep a calendar of my menstrual cycle.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,That is horrible.
Leslie Knope,They don't do that to me.
Leslie Knope,Do they do that to me?
Paula Horke,"I once tried to start a commission to try to get more jobs for women in city government, and they dismissed me, saying that it was because it was just my time of the month."
Paula Horke,"Admittedly, they were right."
Paula Horke,Because of the calendar.
Leslie Knope,Man pigs.
Leslie Knope,All of them.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, I'm gonna get that commission going, because this inequality has gone on long enough."
April Ludgate,"You know what, I think men are better than women."
Leslie Knope,She's kidding.
April Ludgate,"No, I'm not."
April Ludgate,"They provide for us, and we must obey them because they are our masters."
Leslie Knope,"April, stop it."
April Ludgate,"Leslie, you'll never land a beau with that domineering tone."
April Ludgate,We must always walk behind the men.
Leslie Knope,She ugh.

Chris Traeger,An equal gender employment commission.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I don't think this is a good idea."
Chris Traeger,I think it's a fantastic idea.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I didn't know where you were going with that.
Chris Traeger,The lack of women in this government is criminal.
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna ask each department to send two people to a meeting today.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Chris Traeger,And!
Chris Traeger,Andand I can ask Shauna MalwaeTweep to write an article about it for the Pawnee Journal.
Chris Traeger,She's my special friend.
Leslie Knope,That's what you're calling her now.
Chris Traeger,I don't know what to call her.
Chris Traeger,I don't entirely understand the behavior of young people.
Chris Traeger,"Recently, we engaged in something called a ""group hang."""
Chris Traeger,"It was like a date, but there were seven other people there."
Chris Traeger,It was very confusing.
Chris Traeger,I'm not really sure what our label is.
Chris Traeger,"Labels can be bad, but they can also be good."
Chris Traeger,"""Warning: Toxic bleach"" is a good label."
Chris Traeger,Shauna MalwaeTweep has amazing dimples.
Leslie Knope,So the commission?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, right, the commission."
Chris Traeger,I'm gonna get that going right now.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know this text you sent me was a lie and Michael Stipe is not actually here, correct?"
Tom Haverford,Correct.
Tom Haverford,That was a lie.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, no, I knew it was."
Ben Wyatt,I just couldn't live with myself if it had been true.
Tom Haverford,And that's why I sent it.
Andy Dwyer,Where's free Skittles?
Tom Haverford,"Here you go, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,Aw!
Ben Wyatt,He gets his thing?
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I need you two to teach me everything you know about basketball."
Tom Haverford,RentASwag is doing really well.
Tom Haverford,I'm on track to turn a profit in my third month.
Tom Haverford,One problem: All the kids that shop in the store are basketball crazy.
Tom Haverford,It's all they talk about.
Tom Haverford,"I need to be able to schmooze them, and I can't keep referring to basketball players as ""Khloe Kardashian's husband and his friends."""
Tom Haverford,You're just the men to help me out.
Tom Haverford,"One jock, one geek who loves stats."
Tom Haverford,I'll give you a few minutes to cancel the rest of your plans for the day.
Andy Dwyer,No need.
Andy Dwyer,My only plan was to buy Skittles.
April Ludgate,"Wow, Chris."
April Ludgate,Your gender equality commission is a real sausage fest.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're kidding me.
Chris Traeger,I just assumed that some of the departments would send women.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,I am part of the problem.
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Did anyone notice that there are no women on the Gender Equality Commission?
Councilman Milton,"Oh, there's a lady right next to you."
Councilman Milton,"Oh, wait, no."
Councilman Milton,It's just a very beautiful man.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, okay, we are gonna need to rebalance this commission."
Councilman Milton,"Listen, you did a great job setting it up and getting the snacks ready, but we'll take it from here."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Councilman Milton, I did put the snacks together, and they are delicious, I must say, but that is not the point."
Councilman Milton,Round of applause for the girl.
Councilman Milton,She has to leave to get more snacks.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,This is my commission!
Councilman Milton,Ouch.
Councilman Milton,Why so ornery?
Councilman Milton,It's not the 7th yet.
Ron Swanson,Hm.
Ivy Lewis,Your shoes are red now.
Zoe Lewis,Yay.
Ron Swanson,Hooray.
Diane Lewis,Hey!
Ivy Lewis,Mommy!
Diane Lewis,"You survived, huh?"
Ron Swanson,"Indeed, I did."
Diane Lewis,How were they?
Diane Lewis,Really?
Ron Swanson,Couldn't have been better.
Ron Swanson,We had a wonderful time.
Diane Lewis,"Well, that's good."
Diane Lewis,"'Cause my sitter's still out of town, so I really hate to ask you this, but is there any way you could take them again tomorrow?"
Ron Swanson,Of course.
Ron Swanson,I'd be delighted.
Diane Lewis,You're a lifesaver.
Diane Lewis,Thank you.
Diane Lewis,"Girls, you wanna spend another day with Ron?"
Zoe Lewis,Yeah!
Councilman Milton,I believe one problem with hiring women is that they're frail and breakable.
Leslie Knope,Is it possible you're thinking about light bulbs?
Leslie Knope,Or your hip?
April Ludgate,Mm.
April Ludgate,"If I were 300 years older, Councilman."
Leslie Knope,"Incoherent ramblings aside, I've done some research, and the female employment rate in government is abysmal."
Leslie Knope,The number one offender: Sanitation.
Extra,All right!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, stop celebrating."
Leslie Knope,"Why are there no female garbage collectors, Steve?"
Extra,I don't know.
Extra,We hire women for other things.
Leslie Knope,"You have one woman, and she's a secretary."
Extra,"And she's the best secretary we got, except for Dan."
Extra,Dan's awesome.
Extra,Dan.
Leslie Knope,"Garbage collectors make good wages, they have good benefits, and they are the smelly glue that keeps this city together."
Leslie Knope,You need to hire more women.
Dewey,"Not that many women apply, plus it's a very physically demanding job."
Dewey,Your average woman can't handle it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I took extensive notes on ways to maximize our efficiency, because we can't be just as good as the men."
Leslie Knope,We have to be better.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you're totally right."
April Ludgate,Let's rock this.
Leslie Knope,"April, I love you, but I don't need your sarcasm right now."
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Let's get rolling.
April Ludgate,I wanna get into some garbage.
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I love garbage.
April Ludgate,You ever found a dead body in the trash?
April Ludgate,Or body parts?
April Ludgate,"Like, a torso or a head?"
April Ludgate,Please say head.
Extra,"Hey, Dewey."
Extra,Leslie brought binders.
Dewey,What do they say?
Dewey,"""Pick up garbage."
Dewey,"Put in truck""?"
Leslie Knope,"Actually, yeah."
Leslie Knope,That's what's in the binder on every page because I believe in being thorough.
Dewey,All right.
Dewey,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Let's do it, trash people!"
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,Let's feed the beast!
Ron Swanson,Here you are.
Ron Swanson,I had to search the directory for quite a while.
Ron Swanson,I thought your last name was Hanson for some reason.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's Perkins."
Ann Perkins,Always has been.
Ron Swanson,You seem more like a Hanson.
Ron Swanson,"Anyway, I have the girls again today, and they're asking to play with you."
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,I thought they hated me.
Ron Swanson,"No, the opposite."
Ron Swanson,"I don't know what you did to 'em, but it worked like gangbusters."
Ann Perkins,"Or they do hate me, and you're just desperate and tired."
Ron Swanson,"Either way, can you help me?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm out of activities, and they're playing with my land mine."
Zoe Lewis,This thing's cool.
Zoe Lewis,What are these things?
Chris Traeger,Let's play a word association game.
Chris Traeger,"I'll say a word, and then you say the first thing that pops into your mind."

Chris Traeger,"According to Leslie's binder, she and April are making even better time than the guys do on a normal day."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's weird."
Leslie Knope,"You know, with us being women and all, you'd think our boobs would get in the way."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is that accurate Mr. Phlegner?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is Councilwoman Knope ahead of the regular schedule for this route?
Extra,Whatever.
Extra,No comment.
Leslie Knope,Tough stuff.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Are you posing?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't have a photographer with me.

Ben Wyatt,"All right, let's start with the basics."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, why don't you just play some oneonone, see if you can score?"
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, guard him."
Tom Haverford,"Eh, he's too big."
Tom Haverford,I can't see over him.
Tom Haverford,It's not fair.
Tom Haverford,I feel like everyone should be the same size.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you have to create space."
Ben Wyatt,You gotta just dribble around him.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Tom Haverford,Now what?
Ben Wyatt,Shoot!
Ben Wyatt,Shoot the ball.

Ron Swanson,"What is wrong with you, woman?"
Ann Perkins,Sorry.
Ann Perkins,I thought kids liked ghost stories.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, girls!"
Ann Perkins,Did you wanna look through my nurse kit?
Zoe Lewis,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,"Ooh, check it out, bandages!"
Ann Perkins,"We can wrap up the dolls, and pretend they just had surgery."
Ivy Lewis,Yeah!

Zoe Lewis,Yeah!
Ann Perkins,"Here, Zoe, watch."
Ivy Lewis,Do me!
Ivy Lewis,Do me!

Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,"You know what, Ron?"
Ann Perkins,"I can watch them for a little while, if you wanna Take a break."
April Ludgate,This is Stacy Knoblauch's house.
April Ludgate,"I went to high school with her, and she was super mean to me, and now I know that she dyes her hair."
April Ludgate,I knew that wench wasn't naturally blonde.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,She has to use prescription strength deodorant.
April Ludgate,This is the best day of my life.
Extra,"Hey, ladies, someone just called in a pickup."
Extra,We have to make an unscheduled stop.
Extra,Hope you can handle it.
Extra,It's not in the binders.
Leslie Knope,A new challenge?
Leslie Knope,"Bring it on, Stevie boy."

April Ludgate,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Nothin' but net.
Andy Dwyer,Nice!
Andy Dwyer,You are officially a baller.
Tom Haverford,"I've been a baller since birth, son."
Tom Haverford,"Now, I'm an athlete."
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,You little chumps wanna play some ball?
Extra,Sure.
Tom Haverford,Let's do this.
Tom Haverford,Watch out.
Tom Haverford,Tommy from half court.
Ben Wyatt,This could really only go poorly.
Tom Haverford,He won't get out of my way!
Ben Wyatt,"Tom Oh, my God!"
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Tom, what the hell are you doing?"
Tom Haverford,I'm pivoting.
Tom Haverford,Ben told me to pivot.
Ben Wyatt,"I told you you can pivot, not that you can only pivot."
Ben Wyatt,Stop pivoting!
Tom Haverford,"All right, that's illegal."
Tom Haverford,"I may not know much, but you can't just steal the ball from another player."
Extra,"Hey, aren't you the guy who owns RentASwag?"
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Extra,"You suck at basketball, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you suck at being polite, sir."
Extra,"This has been fun, but we have an actual game tomorrow against guys who can actually play."
Extra,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer for the dunk!
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that wall's so close."
Ann Perkins,"Doctors, the operation is now complete."
Ann Perkins,"Doctor Zoe, could you please use the reflex hammer to see if she's okay?"
Ann Perkins,This is the most fun I have ever had with kids.
Ann Perkins,They even said they wanted to be doctors when they grow up.
Ann Perkins,Hot tip for you babysitters out there.
Ann Perkins,Let your kids play with medical tools all the time.
Ron Swanson,We have a problem.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Girls!
Ron Swanson,This is not a negotiation.
Ron Swanson,Unlock the door immediately.
Zoe Lewis,No!
Zoe Lewis,We're doing surgery!
Zoe Lewis,Only doctors are allowed in here.
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"Stand back, ladies!"
Ann Perkins,"Ron, no, no, no, no!"
Ann Perkins,That's dangerous!
Ann Perkins,"Somebody in here's gotta have keys, right?"
Jerry Gergich,I have keys.
Jerry Gergich,Wha
Ron Swanson, Jerry.
Ron Swanson,"I never thought I would say this, but I am so glad you're here."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, it's gotta be one of these, right?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."
Ron Swanson,"Ladies, no, no, no, no, no!"
Zoe Lewis,The patient needs a haircut.
Zoe Lewis,Her hair is infected.
Ron Swanson,"Hurry, Jerry!"
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, I'm trying."
Jerry Gergich,It's not this one.
Ron Swanson,No.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, I'm not good under pressure like this."
Ann Perkins,"Zoe, stop it, please!"
Zoe Lewis,No!
Ron Swanson,"Zoe, put the scissors down."
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Ann Perkins,No!
Extra,Bakery called this in.
Extra,Needs to go on that truck right there.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, easy, breezy, beautiful."
Leslie Knope,That's the covergirl slogan.
Leslie Knope,I didn't mean to say that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here we go!"
Leslie Knope,On three!
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, move it."
Leslie Knope,"On four, five, six, here we go!"
Extra,You need a hand?
Leslie Knope,"No, no, we don't need a hand."
Leslie Knope,"What, you think Joan of Arc needed a hand?"
April Ludgate,Doing what?
Leslie Knope,Let me tell you something.
Leslie Knope,"We are not leaving until this symbolic feminist obstacle is loaded onto that truck of women's advancement, and you can put that on the record, Shauna."
Extra,"Well, you ladies clearly have everything in hand."
Extra,Dewey and I are gonna head back to base.
Extra,Hope we didn't throw you off schedule.
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Extra,Have fun!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Shauna, maybe not put this part on the record."
Leslie Knope,"You know, leave the earlier part on the record, but if we can't get this fridge onto the truck then maybe not put that on the record, and then just destroy the record altogether."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Okay, guys, I'm gonna go ahead and decide what's on and off the record on my own."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Cool?
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Leslie Knope, The whole city is watching.
Leslie Knope," If I can't move that fridge onto that truck, then feminism is over in this town."
Leslie Knope, I don't know why I thought sneaking up on it would work.
Jerry Gergich, This is the one.
Jerry Gergich, This is
Ron Swanson,Oh! Why do you have so many keys?
Zoe Lewis,We did surgery just like you taught us!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you girls clean up all this hair, and I'm gonna talk to Ron."
Ivy Lewis,Let's cut off our toes!
Ann Perkins,"No, let's not."
Ann Perkins," I'm gonna take this bag, too."
Ron Swanson, You need to fix this.
Ann Perkins, It's not that bad.
Ann Perkins, Nobody got hurt.
Ron Swanson," It's extremely bad! I love this woman, and I just wanna show her that I'm capable of watching her children without something horrible happening."
Ann Perkins, What? Did you just say you love Diane?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson, I did not.
Ann Perkins," Yes, you did! That is so cute!"
Ron Swanson,"For God's sake, Hanson, will you please focus on the larger problem?"
Zoe Lewis,Ron loves Mommy!
Ivy Lewis, Ron loves Mommy!
Ron Swanson,"Girls, girls, I don't know what you think you heard, but please don't tell your mother what you incorrectly think you heard."
Ann Perkins,Ron loves Mommy!
Ann Perkins,Ron loves Mommy!
Ron Swanson, I love nothing!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm gonna have to start writing this up soon.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, Kinda sucks.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, I thought maybe we'd be done in time to grab a drink.
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Have you been to Bistro d'Amour? It's really romantic.
Chris Traeger,Ooh.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," Yeah, it was just gonna be you and me, my sister, a few people from work, and my ex-boyfriend."
Chris Traeger, That's really confusing.
Chris Traeger, I have a request.
Chris Traeger, Could you please make sure that my involvement in this stays off the record? I wouldn't want anyone thinking that you're biased because we're something.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, You don't have to worry about that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, I'm gonna include a disclaimer describing the nature of our relationship.
Chris Traeger, I guess I'll have to wait for tomorrow's paper to find out our status.
Chris Traeger, Why did I have to fall for somebody from the old media?
April Ludgate,Maybe we should just eat the refrigerator.
April Ludgate," We start chewing now, we can finish before the sun comes up."
Leslie Knope," We have to solve this problem, or they are going to point to this forever as a reason to not hire women."
Leslie Knope, I should never have taken the bait.
Leslie Knope," It was just such tasty, righteously flavored bait."
Extra, You here to move the fridge?
April Ludgate,Are you a ghost?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, we are."
Extra, Why you think you can lift it? You are two little canaries.
Extra, Those garbagemen couldn't even lift it.
Extra, They are like giant bears.
Leslie Knope, Hold on.
Leslie Knope, What do you mean?
Extra,"Bears are bigger than canaries, yes? So if bears can't lift the"
Leslie Knope,"No, I understand animal sizes."
Leslie Knope, What do you mean they couldn't lift it?
Extra,"They tried three days ago, and it does not budge."
Extra," They say they're gonna come back with more guys, but they come back with canaries."
Extra," Fly away, little canaries."
Leslie Knope, Those Sanitation goons set us up.
Leslie Knope, You know what? Let's just go.
April Ludgate, What? No! We can't let them beat us.
Leslie Knope, Just call it a tie.
Leslie Knope, Nobody can lift it.
April Ludgate," No, Leslie, we do not want to tie."
April Ludgate, We want to win.
April Ludgate," Those guys suck, okay? We have to prove them wrong."
April Ludgate," Look, all we have to do is get some PCP."
April Ludgate, You can move anything on angel dust.
April Ludgate," My cousin Hesen, he beat off five cops on that stuff."
Leslie Knope," Okay, hold on."
Leslie Knope, Sir! Does this refrigerator still work?
Extra,Works okay.
Extra, We got a new one.
Extra, We don't need it.
Andy Dwyer, So what if those kids think you're the lamest guy in the world?
Andy Dwyer,"That's not who you want shopping at RentASwag anyways, Tom."
Tom Haverford, That's exactly who I want shopping at RentASwag.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, well, then, that sucks."
Ben Wyatt," Look, I wanna show you something."
Ben Wyatt," Okay, this is Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook after a bad loss."
Ben Wyatt," Even the greats get beat, but they get back out there the next day, and they fight."
Ben Wyatt, So let's hit the gym again tomorrow.
Tom Haverford," Guys, I think I just dribbled up an idea."
Tom Haverford," No, double dribbled it."
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, you have learned nothing about basketball."
Andy Dwyer," You're a good friend, Ben."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, thanks."
Andy Dwyer, Can I borrow 1500 dollars? You're not allowed to ask what it's for.
Andy Dwyer, Fireworks.
Ron Swanson," First of all, everyone is fine."
Ron Swanson," No one got hurt, but there was an incident."
Diane Lewis," Oh, my God."
Diane Lewis, What happened?
Ann Perkins,"Diane, this is all my fault."
Ann Perkins, I let them go into my nurse's bag.
Diane Lewis," Well, who has been having fun with scissors?"
Ivy Lewis,Us! Ann taught us how to be doctors!
Diane Lewis,Yay!
Ron Swanson,You're not mad?
Diane Lewis,"No, it's fine."
Diane Lewis, They're kids.
Diane Lewis," Once, Zoe put Ivy in the dryer, so"
Ron Swanson,I'm still incredibly sorry.
Ron Swanson, I feel like I let you down.
Diane Lewis, It is so sweet to me how much you care.
Diane Lewis, This is why I love you.
Ron Swanson, Oh.
Ron Swanson," Well, I love you, too."
Ann Perkins, That's my cue.
Ann Perkins," All right, girls, good hang."
Ivy Lewis,"Bye, Ann!"
Zoe Lewis,"Thanks, Ann."
Ann Perkins, Oh.
Chris Traeger," Hey, Leslie! Shauna just sent me the disclaimer that she's gonna use before she prints the article."
Chris Traeger," ""City manager Chris Traeger was present for this event, and has a personal relationship with the author."""
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's pretty good, right? ""Personal relationship."""
Chris Traeger,It's not romantic.
Chris Traeger, But it is descriptive.
Chris Traeger," No, it's not even descriptive."
Leslie Knope," I know you're not used to this, but maybe you should just try to keep it chill and see what happens."
Chris Traeger, Great advice.
Chris Traeger," Impossible to follow, but great advice."
Leslie Knope," So do you think the soup kitchen could use that fridge? I mean, April and I were gonna haul it onto the truck effortlessly, but if you need it"
Extra,Absolutely.
Extra, This is a godsend.
Extra, Thank you for thinking of us.
Extra," Grab a side, ladies."
Extra, I think all of us can get it on the truck.
Leslie Knope," Not only did we complete the garbage route and move an unmovable fridge, but the Sanitation department hired three new female trash haulers."
Leslie Knope," And, best of all, April gave me this present to commemorate our feminist victory."
Leslie Knope, And it's trash.
Leslie Knope, It's filled with trash.
Leslie Knope, Maybe there's something on the bottom here.
Leslie Knope," Let me see, No, just trash."
Extra, This is Brandon Turnbill for Kids' 46 News.
Extra," I'm here with the star of today's win, Josh Diamond."
Extra," What was the key to the victory, Josh?"
Extra,"Well, uh, everything just came together for us, and we came out on top, and we're gonna try to keep it going next week against Snerling."
Tom Haverford," Thanks, tiny reporter."
Tom Haverford," It was a huge win for Josh and the boys, and after a huge win, be sure to visit RentASwag on Durham Avenue for all your postgame press conference fashion rental needs."
Tom Haverford," We've got everything: Dope suits, pocket squares, Gingham shirts, glasses with no lenses, Tiny cardigans, Fedoras Look at this watch! Whatever swag you need, You can rent at RentASwag."
Tom Haverford," Now, that's basketball."

Ron Swanson,I'm gonna get 12 eggs and part of a dead animal.
Ron Swanson,Dealer's choice.
Ron Swanson,Please and thank you.
JJ,"What can I get you, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,I will have oatmeal and berries.
Ann Perkins,"And I will have catfish and grits, with pumpernickel toast."
Ron Swanson,Explain.
Ann Perkins,"Well, instead of getting swept up in my boyfriends' personalities, I am dating myself and trying new things."
Ann Perkins,"So every time I go out to eat, I order one thing that's typical me and then something that I would never order."
Leslie Knope,"Now I have two best friends, Ann and Ann."
Leslie Knope,Each one more beautiful than the other.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, I also have been documenting all the new things I'm trying on my blog."
Ann Perkins,Check this out.
Ann Perkins,I went skydiving.
Ben Wyatt,Which Ann is screaming like a maniac?
Ben Wyatt,Oatmeal Ann or catfish Ann?
Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, because I instantly blacked out from extreme terror."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, I have an idea for your blog."
Leslie Knope,I think you should take yourself iceskating.
Ann Perkins,That sounds fun.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we'll do a double date: You and you, and me and Ben."
Leslie Knope,"But I have to warn you, I'm very good at iceskating."
Leslie Knope,I can do jumps.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,I probably shouldn't come.
Leslie Knope,I'll embarrass the both of you.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, I know what my next activity is gonna be."
Ann Perkins,And it's a biggie.
Ann Perkins,I want to be a mom.
Ann Perkins,I'm going to the sperm bank today.
Ann Perkins,Can you come?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, today?"
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you know that I fully support any woman's decision especially a beautiful unicorn nurse like yourself in creating the family that she wants."
Leslie Knope,But you are so brilliant and kind and stupid hot.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're definitely gonna find a wonderful guy who loves you and respects you and fills your home with multiethnic genius babies."
Ann Perkins,"Maybe, or maybe not."
Ann Perkins,"You hit the lottery with Ben, and that's great, but not everybody's so lucky."
Ann Perkins,"I've wanted to be a mom for a long time, I'm ready, and I think I'd be good at it."
Leslie Knope,Ann is giving up on love and deciding to have a baby with herself.
Leslie Knope,And she has only been dating herself for six weeks.
Leslie Knope,"If she were dating a guy for six weeks, and they decided to have a kid, I'd be like, ""Congratulations, Ann And Channing Tatum."""
Leslie Knope,Because that is the only scenario that would make sense to me.
Chris Traeger,What a gorgeous herbaceous medley.
Ron Swanson,There's been a mistake.
Ron Swanson,You've accidentally given me the food that my food eats.
Extra,Salad is traditionally the first course at a wedding.
Ron Swanson,Is a gerbil marrying a rabbit?
Ben Wyatt,I'm in charge of food for the wedding.
Ben Wyatt,So I brought in Pawnee's three best caterers and a panel of experts.
Ben Wyatt,Chris loves vegetables.
Ben Wyatt,Ron loves meat.
Ben Wyatt,"And Tom considers himself a foodie, which apparently means taking instagrams of food instead of eating it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so I liked number one, Chris liked number two, and Ron liked number three."
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, what about you?"
Tom Haverford,"Caterer number one's presentation was simple, mm, yet exhausting."
Tom Haverford,"Number two's was subtle and provocative, like a coy Dutch woman guarding a dark secret."
Ben Wyatt,Nothing you're saying is helpful.
Tom Haverford,But number three's told a story a story from a book I wouldn't read but I would watch the movie of.
Ben Wyatt,That's nonsense.
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna go with the first place.
Ben Wyatt,I really loved that appetizer.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, the mini calzone?"
Ben Wyatt,I wouldn't call it that.
Ben Wyatt,It was more like a savory pastry.
Ben Wyatt,"Delicate little dough pocket filled with tomato sauce, cheese, and seasoned meat."
Ben Wyatt,Just a stunning culinary innovation.
Ron Swanson,It was a calzone.
Chris Traeger,It was literally just a small calzone.
Extra,Let me just get some details for your file.
Extra,"Now, are you two a couple?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Tragically, we are both heterosexual."
Extra,"So, Ann, what are you looking for in particular?"
Ann Perkins,Some sperm.
Extra,I meant in terms of a donor?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, you know, nice guy Nice sperm."
Extra,"Flip through this binder, make a note of anyone who interests you, and I'll be back shortly."
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Ann Perkins,This guy went to Harvard!
Leslie Knope,So did the Unabomber.
Ann Perkins,This guys seems healthy.
Ann Perkins,Loves cycling.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so did Lance Armstrong, and he turned out to be a lying drug user."
Leslie Knope,Or a hero.
Leslie Knope,I don't know where we stand on him now.
Joe From Sewage,"Hello, ladies."
Joe From Sewage,Fancy meeting you here.
Leslie Knope,"Whoa, Sewage Joe."
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you remember Joe Fantringham."
Leslie Knope,He is the gentleman who was fired for emailing a picture of his penis to every woman in city hall.
Joe From Sewage,Guilty.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's what the judge said."
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"Joe, you are a donor here, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"Did you hear that, Ann?"
Joe From Sewage,"Big time, me and all my buddies."
Joe From Sewage,"Free money, free porn."
Joe From Sewage,Best job I ever had.
Joe From Sewage,"Also If you're looking to buy some weed, I'm looking as well."
Leslie Knope,Shall we?
Ann Perkins,Yup.
April Ludgate,"Okay, Leslie Knope outfit number eight."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, you look super hot."
Donna Meagle,You realize you've said that about all of them?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, she has, every single time."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause she is super hot.
Andy Dwyer,"Honestly, you'd look hot naked."
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,This suit makes me want to scold a Catholic child.
April Ludgate,"I don't know who Ann Taylor is, but I hate her and I want to kill her."
April Ludgate,"I have to lead a public forum for the Pawnee Commons every day this week, and I hate talking to people."
April Ludgate,"So, to get through it, I figured I'm just gonna basically try to imitate Leslie."
April Ludgate,She still wears this.
April Ludgate,She had the patch sewn in.
April Ludgate,You can't remove it.
April Ludgate,"What's in the pocket, you ask?"
April Ludgate,"A ticket stub from a Fleetwood Mac concert in 1995, and"
Donna Meagle,"This one is terrible, but it is slightly less terrible than the rest."
April Ludgate,"So tomorrow, I lead a public forum in Leslie's Fleetwood Mac sex pants."
Andy Dwyer,Fleetwood Mac Sex Pants.
Andy Dwyer,New band name.
Andy Dwyer,I call it.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,Maybe just Fleetwood Mac.
Ann Perkins,So what's the next move?
Ann Perkins,"Is there, like, a better sperm bank in Eagleton or something?"
Leslie Knope,"Um, you don't want a demon baby."
Leslie Knope,"Look, you're Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,Sperm that is worthy of your perfect eggs does not grow on trees.
Leslie Knope,"I think, ideally, you'd want to know the guy, right?"
Leslie Knope,"You'd want to know his personality, his favorite season of Friends, whether or not he hates jazz hopefully, he does."
Leslie Knope,You'd want to know him.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, Leslie, you're totally right."
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna make a list of all the guys I already know who could be donors."
Ann Perkins,"And then, I'm gonna call them and tell them I'm doing some blog entry on men's health or something."
Ann Perkins,I can interview them and ask them whatever I want.
Ann Perkins,You're a genius!
Ann Perkins,"This is your idea, and I love it."
Ann Perkins,I'll call you later.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"If I don't slow this baby train down, Ann may end up having a baby with some random weirdo instead of her soul mate."
Leslie Knope,I fully believe that a woman should be in charge of what happens to her body.
Leslie Knope,"In this case, the body is Ann's, and the woman in charge of it is me."
Ann Perkins,I was up all night brainstorming and this is the complete official list of candidates for Ann's baby daddy.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, how did you come up with these three names?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, I eliminated everyone in a relationship and the obvious ""No"" s, like Knucklehair Dave from HR."
Ann Perkins,I don't mind the knuckle hair.
Ann Perkins,I just think he's a dick.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,And I was left with those three guys.
Ann Perkins,"Don't forget, they don't know about the sperm donor thing."
Ann Perkins,I don't want them to know.
Ann Perkins,I told them I was interviewing them for a blog.
Ann Perkins,Here comes the first one.
Ann Perkins,Dr. Harris!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there he is."
Dr. Harris,Hi.
Dr. Harris,"Ann, Leslie."
Dr. Harris,Small office.
Dr. Harris,Mine's way bigger.
Dr. Harris,Is this gonna take long?
Dr. Harris,Got a patient coming in.
Ann Perkins,"No, not at all."
Ann Perkins,Please have a seat.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, maybe you should check in on your patient."
Leslie Knope,I know that I hate it when my doctor makes me wait.
Dr. Harris,Guy's got a spinal fracture.
Dr. Harris,He's not going anywhere.
Leslie Knope,Uhhuh.
Dr. Harris,Ooh.
Dr. Harris,The seats in my office are leather.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Chris?
Ben Wyatt,I'm dying.
Chris Traeger,I was dying earlier today.
Chris Traeger,And then I died.
Chris Traeger,Now I'm dead.
Chris Traeger,I had to cancel a date with Shauna MalwaeTweep.
Chris Traeger,And I really like her.
Chris Traeger,Do you think she'll still like me now that I'm dead?
Ben Wyatt,What is this?
Ron Swanson,It's food poisoning.
Ron Swanson,I have it too.
Ron Swanson,I did not sleep for one second last night.
Ron Swanson,And I cracked the bottom of the toilet bowl.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, don't say that."
Chris Traeger,Has anybody talked to Tom?
Chris Traeger,I can't even imagine what that tiny little man must be feeling like.
Ron Swanson,I have voided more than Tom's body weight in the last 12 hours alone.
Ron Swanson,He might have just disappeared off the earth.
Chris Traeger,We need to call him.
Chris Traeger,We must reach out to him.
Chris Traeger,I can't do it.
Ron Swanson,"Ben, extension 7820."
April Ludgate,"Hello, everyone."
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate from the Parks Department.
April Ludgate,And welcome to a public forum about the Pawnee Commons.
April Ludgate,"As Eleanor Roosevelt once said to Betty Ford ""Hillary Clinton is great."""
April Ludgate,"Now, if you all would kindly look under your chairs, you will find a special surprise a flyer with details about the project, and Friendship bands that I've made for each and every one of you."
April Ludgate,"So now, I guess we're Park Pals."
Andy Dwyer,You should see the booger under this chair.
April Ludgate,Andy.
Pete Disellio,"It's nice to see you again, Ann."
Pete Disellio,I was happy to get the call.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Pete, you look great."
Pete Disellio,Aww.
Ann Perkins,So are you still dunking basketballs?
Pete Disellio,"You know, I'm a lot more than just a former high school basketball star."
Pete Disellio,I teach marketing over at Pawnee Community College.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, that's great."
Pete Disellio,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Would you say you value education?
Pete Disellio,I see what's going on here.
Pete Disellio,You want my sperm.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,What are you talking about?
Pete Disellio,When will women in this town stop scheming to get my sperm?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That son of a bitch is astute.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all I need to do is just shoot one more person down and then I can buy some time and convince Ann to wait for her own Ben level soul mate."
Leslie Knope,The last guy is Howard Tuttleman.
Leslie Knope,I know that name.
Leslie Knope,How do I know that name?
The Douche,"I know it's a winter's morn, but it feels like a summer's eve, 'cause ""the douche"" is in the building."
The Douche,"What's up, ladies?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, whoa!"
Tom Haverford,Smells like some vomit took a dump in here.
Tom Haverford,What happened?
Ron Swanson,"We got food poisoning, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Yuck.
Ron Swanson,How do you not have food poisoning?
Ben Wyatt,Because he didn't eat anything.
Ben Wyatt,"He just took pictures and talked about the ""wow"" factor."
Tom Haverford,Not true.
Tom Haverford,I ate everything you did.
Chris Traeger,Are you sure?
Chris Traeger,Is there anything that you didn't eat?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I didn't eat those stupid mini calzones.
Tom Haverford,Haverfood rule number six never eat anything with a sauce I have to dip myself.
Tom Haverford,Drizzle it on for me.
Tom Haverford,I'm not your maid.
Ben Wyatt,The calzones betrayed me?
Ben Wyatt,"Never again, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"As God as my witness, they're dead to me."
Tom Haverford,"All right, well, Tommy feels great."
Tom Haverford,And I'm about to go eat some lasagna.
Tom Haverford,Peace!
Extra,I'm afraid this park will raise my taxes.
April Ludgate,"Ah, well, fear not."
April Ludgate,Between the normal Parks budget and our corporate partners 
Extra,I'm also afraid the park will be noisy.
Extra,And full of spiders.
Extra,And dark at nighttime.
Extra,I'm scared of a lot of stuff.
Extra,Everything's fine.
Extra,I'm fine.
Extra,"I'm Walter, and I'm fine."
Harris,Is this gonna be a topless park?
April Ludgate,I don't think there are topless parks.
Harris,"Well, let's build the first one and be heroes."
Gretel,"If this is going to be a topless park, I won't sign your petition."
Harris,"If she's going to the topless park, I'm not signing the topless park petition."
Harris,"You know, I take that back, I'm still in."
Harris,What's up?
Harris,I'm Harris.
Chance Frenlm,"Yeah, yeah."
Chance Frenlm,Forget whatever that Pawnee Commons is.
Chance Frenlm,I'm with that pervert.
Chance Frenlm,Topless park.
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Chance Frenlm,Topless park!
Ann Perkins,Where'd you go to school again?
The Douche,Northwestern.
The Douche,I studied semiotics.
The Douche,Wrote a thesis on narrative forms in the digital world.
Leslie Knope,"Then you became a morning shockjock and created the sport ""taint ball""?"
The Douche,Yeah.
The Douche,"You know, the douche persona is something I came up with during college."
The Douche,"It started as satire, and, you know, we snowballed to where we are today."
The Douche,"I mean, I know it's a silly thing to do, but it pays the bills."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think, you probably need to get back to the studio, play some fart jokes, make fun of some immigrants."
The Douche,"Actually, a farting immigrant segment would be really funny."
The Douche,"Ay dios Good looking out, Leslie."
The Douche,"You guys ever want to do this again, sans clothing, give me a shout."
Leslie Knope,Gross.
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
The Douche,"Honestly, good luck on this project."
The Douche,It sounds really interesting.
The Douche,"I'm gonna scan a quick pic of them boobies for a little deposit in ""El banco de spanko."""
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
The Douche,Douche nation.
The Douche,You guys know where the library is?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's not gonna work."
Leslie Knope,Back to the drawing board.
Ann Perkins,No need.
Ann Perkins,I choose Howard.
Leslie Knope,You want to have a baby with the douche?
Ann Perkins,"His name's Howard Tuttleman, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,"And I know he plays that obnoxious character on the radio, but he's a good guy, his family is healthy, and he is successful and smart."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you cannot be serious."
Ann Perkins,I am.
Ann Perkins,And I've made my decision.
Ann Perkins,I am sure of it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Douche!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, douche!"
Leslie Knope,Councilman Howser.
Councilman Howser,Councilwoman Knope.
The Douche,"'Sup, Leslie?"
The Douche,You wanna funk this junk in the back of my trunk?
The Douche,That was the douche talking.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, Ann is not interviewing you for her blog."
Leslie Knope,"She's thinking about having a baby, and she's considering you as a possible donor."
The Douche,Wow.
The Douche,"You know, I've thought a lot about having kids."
The Douche,It's the next big step in this grand adventure that we call life.
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I don't think you would be the right man for the job."
The Douche,"Well, frankly, I don't think it's for you to decide."
The Douche,"You know, if we had a little girl, I would name her Elizabeth, after my grandmother."
The Douche,"She was this strong, amazing woman."
The Douche,"And if we had a boy, I don't know, I'd name him something funny, like ""Dick"" or ""O.J."""
The Douche,Guess I have a lot to consider.
Leslie Knope,My God.
Leslie Knope,I have driven Ann right into the belly of the douche.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what's up?"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, nothing."
Ann Perkins,"I was listening to the radio on my way here, and I heard something very interesting."
The Douche,"So, Crazy Ira, remember that chick Ann I used to"
Crazy Ira,"Yeah, she was smoking hot!"
The Douche,"Turns out, she wants to have my baby."
The Douche,"Anyway, her lesbo friend tells me she's on the prowl for some baby beans And it's down to me and some other turdmunchers."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You should be angry.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Howard did that to you.
Ann Perkins,I can't believe you did that to me.
Ann Perkins,"I am making a very important life decision, and you betrayed me."
Leslie Knope,Because I thought you were making a huge mistake.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I get it."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're frustrated with dating, and you think you're not gonna meet someone, but two years ago, I didn't think I would meet someone like Ben, and I did."
Ann Perkins,My idea of a perfect family does not require a soul mate.
Ann Perkins,"I want a baby, that's it, accept it."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Milton, do we have a meeting?"
Councilman Milton,"Oh, no, no, no."
Councilman Milton,"I just wanted to toss my name into the ring, in respect to this Indian woman's vagina."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, how was the forum?"
April Ludgate,"Um, crappy."
April Ludgate,We only got four signatures.
April Ludgate,"Two of them were me and Andy, and one of them said ""Farts McCool."""
April Ludgate,I just don't know how Leslie can be Leslie all the time.
April Ludgate,I was her for two hours and I want to die.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,We've got another forum today.
Andy Dwyer,Let's just hop back in that saddle.
April Ludgate,What should I do?
April Ludgate,Should I wear a blonde wig?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, yes."
Andy Dwyer,That would be so hot.
April Ludgate,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,If you think if you do you think it would help?
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, if you think it'd help you."
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'm feeling so much better."
Chris Traeger,Almost no weird stuff snuck out of my body last night.
Ron Swanson,And I feel like the emptiness of my stomach is gonna lead to a pretty epic breakfast.
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, what do I do?"
Ben Wyatt,"My choice almost killed us, and we can't agree on another one, so"
Chris Traeger,Maybe there's a catering company in Snerling that we should look into.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it has to be from Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,I just know that's what Leslie wants.
Tom Haverford,I got it.
Tom Haverford,"This might sound crazy, but JeanRalphio has started a catering company."
Ben Wyatt,He has?
Tom Haverford,"Now, granted, he is currently standing trial for counterfeiting Euros, but the trial's gonna be over quick."
Tom Haverford,He's definitely guilty.
Ben Wyatt,"Ugh, forget it."
JJ,Dry toast and half a grapefruit for Chris.
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
JJ,Egg whites for Ben.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
JJ,"Egg whites for Tom, and pretty much everything we make for Ron."
JJ,And don't you go sneaking off.
JJ,I'm sending home some free waffles for Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, JJ."
Ben Wyatt,You're the best.
The Douche,"Okay, we're back."
The Douche,"We, uh, got an update on ""Operation Baby douche."""
The Douche,"All right, special guest is Councilwoman Leslie Knope."
The Douche,"How are you, les?"
Extra,"""Me so horny."""
Leslie Knope,That was not me.
Leslie Knope,That was a farcical sound effect.
Crazy Ira,"Did she say ""fartsicle""?"
The Douche,The fartsicle.
The Douche,Frozen farts you can eat.
The Douche,Put it in your facemouth!
Extra,It's cold and it smells.
Leslie Knope,"God, how did you make that so fast?"
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, look, I am here because I want you to stop talking about my friend's womb."
The Douche,"Sorry, Councilwoman."
The Douche,I'm in it to win it.
The Douche,The douche is gonna be a daddy.
Crazy Ira,And Crazy Ira's gonna be the creepy Uncle.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Look, she is a wonderful person, and she does not deserve this."
Leslie Knope,So I need you to lay off.
The Douche,"Okay, I will lay off if you can survive one round with Breasty Bertha in The Jello Pit!"
Extra,Rudy!
Extra,Get in the Jello.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am a city councilwoman, so I am not gonna Jello wrestle."
The Douche,"I mean, this is fun."
The Douche,Don't you want your constituents to know that you got a fun side?
Crazy Ira,"Yeah, show your fun sides."
Leslie Knope,This is not about me and my constituents!
Leslie Knope,This is about you talking about my friend.
The Douche," All right, I will stop talking about your friend if you get in that Jello for one second and say, ""Rudy."""
The Douche,Cause The Cosby Show.
The Douche,Classic.
Crazy Ira, Classic.
Leslie Knope," Fine, I will stand there for one second and say it, and then we're done."
Crazy Ira, Fair's fair.
The Douche,Fair's fair.
Extra, Somebody get me a pudding pop.
The Douche, Oh! Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Rudy.
Leslie Knope," There, happy?"
Crazy Ira,"No, say it like Bill Cosby."
Leslie Knope, Rudy.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
The Douche," Yeah! Oh, she's touching her boobs now."
Leslie Knope," No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope, I'm just standing here.
Leslie Knope," And I am leaving, just like you're gonna leave Ann alone."
The Douche," Oh, she's in there! She's into it now!"
Extra,"Oh, Rudy has fallen into the Jello."
Extra," Theo, now there's Jello all over my favorite sweater."
Crazy Ira, And the gold medal goes to Leslie Knope!
April Ludgate,"Okay, can you give me that bag? I have to go change into my Leslie suit."
Andy Dwyer," You got it, babe."
April Ludgate, Thanks.
April Ludgate, Andy!
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,This is the wrong bag.
Andy Dwyer, What?
April Ludgate, This bag is full of Fruit RollUps and baseball cards.
April Ludgate, I don't have my Leslie pantsuit or my Leslie headband or my Leslie notes.
April Ludgate, I can't do this meeting without my Leslie stuff.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I am so sorry."
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I guess I must have screwed up.
Andy Dwyer," Look, you look amazing in this outfit."
Andy Dwyer, Plus you're the smartest person on the planet.
Andy Dwyer, I think you can do this just being yourself.
Extra," Yeah, so how much money is this whole Pawnee Commons project gonna cost me?"
April Ludgate,"Uh, good question."
April Ludgate,40% wiill be coming from our corporate partners and another 30%
Extra,"Excuse me, ma'am."
Extra, I didn't ask for a math lesson.
Extra, So why don't you just tell me how much it's gonna cost me? And don't use numbers.
April Ludgate," Look, you won't have to pay any extra money, okay? And don't ever call me ""ma'am"" again."
April Ludgate, Thanks.
April Ludgate, Next question.
Harris," Yeah, I wanted to talk more about that topless park idea that a local hero brought up yesterday."
April Ludgate," Yeah, there's not gonna be a topless park, Harris."
April Ludgate," Nobody wants your creepy stoner eyes staring at them while they're enjoying a park, okay? Stop being gross."
Harris, Yeah.
Harris," Shut me down! You scare me, and I gotta say, I kinda dig that."
Harris, What's your deal?
Andy Dwyer,She's married to me.
Ann Perkins, I heard you on the radio.
Ann Perkins,Thanks for doing that.
Leslie Knope,Got dicey.
Leslie Knope, But they did invite me to participate in their topless Jello-lympics
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Leslie Knope,So that's something.
Ann Perkins, It is possible that you were right.
Ann Perkins," This is obviously a huge decision, and I should take my time."
Leslie Knope," I want you to be happy, you know? I guess I just didn't consider that you would take a different path than I did."
Leslie Knope," I tried to impose my dream on you, and that's wrong."
Leslie Knope, And I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope, But I think you do need to take a little bit more time with this decision.
Leslie Knope, Maybe employ a more methodical approach.
Leslie Knope, One that involves colorcoded binders.
Ann Perkins," Is that a drawing of my reproductive system saying ""Let's do this""? "
Leslie Knope,The Knope way involves a lot of uterine cartoons.
Leslie Knope," What can I tell you? Besides, what is more cuter-us than your uterus?"
Leslie Knope,"You ready, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I'm ready."
Leslie Knope,We're in it now.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, we are."
Leslie Knope, Let's make a baby together.
Ann Perkins, You should phrase that differently.
Leslie Knope, Right.
Ben Wyatt," Are you sure you're cool with JJ's Diner catering what you've referred to as ""The wedding of the millennium""?"
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,I thought that I could not love you any more than I already did.
Leslie Knope, But I was dead wrong.
Ben Wyatt,Is that smoke?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Hey! What are you doing?
April Ludgate,Celebrating.
April Ludgate," We got 80 signatures and, like, 30 complaints of excessive rudeness, but who cares?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you should have seen her, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer, She was awesome.
Andy Dwyer," So smart, so hot, so mean."
Andy Dwyer, I wanted to bone her right there in that dirty church basement.
Leslie Knope," No, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, we are burning this awful pantsuit."
Leslie Knope, That's mine.
Leslie Knope, I wanted that back.
April Ludgate," Well, frankly, you should have thought of that before we burned it."

Leslie Knope,"If I could sum up the Pawnee Commons in one word, it would be: Dynamite."
Leslie Knope,"""Dynamite"" stands for daring, youth friendly, natural, amazing, merry, inviting, tourist attractiony, and ecofriendly."
Extra,"Thank you, Councilwoman Knope very, very thorough  and so many acronyms."
Leslie Knope,I know.
Extra,Councilman Jamm?
Jeremy Jamm,"Thank you, Bill."
Jeremy Jamm,"No, please, everyone be seated."
Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show there was a standing ovation.
Leslie Knope,"No, there wasn't."
Ann Perkins,There was not.
Jeremy Jamm,History will decide.
Jeremy Jamm,My plan for lot 48 is simple.
Jeremy Jamm,But why read it when you can shove it right in your face?
Jeremy Jamm,I want to sell this lot to Paunch Burger.
Jeremy Jamm,Here's why.
Jeremy Jamm,We make money.
Jeremy Jamm,They make money.
Jeremy Jamm,They make burgers.
Jeremy Jamm,We eat burgers.
Extra,Mmhmm.
Jeremy Jamm,That's a win win win win.
Jeremy Jamm,Presentation over.
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm out.
Extra,"Oh, man."
Extra,Are there curly fries?
Extra,I love their curly fries.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the planning commission has a week to decide if they want a beautiful, innovative community park or a bunch of greasy lard bombs."
Leslie Knope,I'm not editorializing.
Leslie Knope,Paunch Burger's number one selling burger is the greasy lard bomb.
Leslie Knope,Just give me a hint as to which way you guys are leaning.
Extra,Off the record?
Extra,We're leaning towards Jamm.
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,You know my plan is better for the community.
Extra,"Oh, it's way better, but you're also short 50,000 dollars."
Extra,We can't approve an underfunded project.
Extra,"Hey, get the rest of the money, you get your park."
Extra,You only have a week.
Leslie Knope,"What are we going to do, guys?"
Leslie Knope,How are we going to get that money?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, come on."
Tom Haverford,"Cheer up, little pups."
Tom Haverford,Registering for your wedding is the most important moment of your lives.
Tom Haverford,Love love fades away.
Tom Haverford,But things  Things are forever.
Ben Wyatt,That's beautiful.
Ben Wyatt,Did the Dalai Lama say that?
Tom Haverford,Ooh!
Tom Haverford,A citrus reamer!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, this is the only way to ream citrus."
Tom Haverford,You're gonna need two of these.
Leslie Knope,I don't want a citrus reamer.
Leslie Knope,I don't want any of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Look, all I want is to be married to you and to somehow get 50,000 dollars."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,What if we register for the park instead of the stuff?
Ben Wyatt,We could organize a black tie gala with food and music and maybe a silent auction to raise money.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and people could donate, or they could bid to put their names on everything in the park, like benches, cobblestones, trees, ants, air."
Ben Wyatt,"Right, some of that is possible."
Leslie Knope,You are a genius.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, guys."
Tom Haverford,I'm really feeling these sheets very cozy.
Leslie Knope,I just want to say thank you for all your hard work this week.
Leslie Knope,Give yourselves a hand.
Leslie Knope,But your applause is premature.
Ann Perkins,You just told us to applaud.
Ann Perkins,"Well, if I told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?"
Ann Perkins,"I hope so, because the only way that this gala is going to happen is if you do everything I say."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, I need you to contact three more food vendors on this list, and they need to do it for free."
Tom Haverford,I'm omelet.
Tom Haverford,Get it?
Tom Haverford,"""I'm on it,"" ""I'm omelet""?"
Leslie Knope,"I get it, and I love it, but I don't have time for food puns right now."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm heading out."

Jerry Gergich,Gayle.
Jerry Gergich,My girls!
Leslie Knope,What's the emergency?
Chris Traeger,"Oh, this is just a drill, but I am having so much fun pretending it's real."
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,The disaster preparedness people picked today?
Leslie Knope,Each year every city in Indiana is reviewed by the Department of Emergency Preparedness.
Leslie Knope,"And Pawnee has failed On last year's report, they stated, ""Every time it so much as drizzles in Pawnee, ""the town is in danger of collapsing into Thunderdome style, postapocalyptic mayhem."""
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we don't know how long Leslie's going to be gone, so let's just knock some of this stuff off."
Ann Perkins,Should someone stop Jerry?
Jerry Gergich,Gayle!
Donna Meagle,"Eh, he'll figure it out eventually."
Andy Dwyer,"First, we do the written exam, and then we do the personality evaluation, which I feel like I'm gonna nail, 'cause people always say, ""But he's got a great personality."""
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, quiz me."
April Ludgate,"Okay, what does it mean when an officer calls in a 3542?"
Andy Dwyer,Assault and battery.
Andy Dwyer,"The way I remember that, I picture 35 a salt shakers and 42 batteries."
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,What is the criminal code for arson?
Andy Dwyer,Arson is 533.
Andy Dwyer,You know how I remember that?
Andy Dwyer,I picture 533 salt shakers and batteries lighting a building on fire.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm nervous."
April Ludgate,"Babe, look at me."
April Ludgate,"You are going to pass this test, and you are going to become a cop."
April Ludgate,"And if you don't, I'll just divorce you and marry someone else and then cheat on them with you."
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, that's so sweet."
April Ludgate,"Also, I got you a lucky charm."
April Ludgate,"I found a dead rabbit on the side of the road, and I cut its feet off and made it into a lucky charm."

Leslie Knope,I am the Pawnee Emergency Czar.
Leslie Knope,"And this year, we are more than prepared for your test, but, um, it just so happens, today is a little inconvenient."
Leonard Tchulm,"Good, because the best day for a drill is when it's inconvenient for everyone."
Leonard Tchulm,My mother is getting a colonoscopy today.
Leonard Tchulm,"I'm not even sure there's anyone there to drive her home, so we're all making sacrifices, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm very sorry to hear about your mother."
Leonard Tchulm,"Mm, we're not that close."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leonard Tchulm,"Okay, volunteer victims, please put your identification placards on now and go to your designated areas throughout town."
Leonard Tchulm,"First Responders, return to your stations, and the simulation begins Went past the zero."

Chris Traeger,The doors will not open until Leonard announces that this drill is complete.
Leslie Knope,"The most important event that I have ever organized in my entire life is happening in eight hours, and I am stuck in this room."
Leslie Knope,This is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Maybe this is a nightmare.
Leslie Knope,"Nope, can't fly away."
Leslie Knope,This is real life.
Leonard Tchulm,"And now, I'm going to open one of these ten envelopes at random to determine your simulated disaster."
Leonard Tchulm,Pawnee has been hit by A strain of avian flu.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Avian flu!
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,"This is a simple one, guys."

Jeremy Jamm,"""The Knope Protocol""?"

Leslie Knope,"This is the avian flu, or we call ""H5N1."""
Ben Wyatt,"Donna, are we on schedule for the tent setup?"
Donna Meagle,"The tables showed up, which is good, but there are no chairs, which is bad."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, get some chairs from somewhere."
Donna Meagle,Great leadership inspiring.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,Leslie was gonna go on Pawnee Today  to promote the gala.
Ron Swanson,I'll do it.
Ben Wyatt,"No offense, Ron, but I don't think you'd be great on TV."
Ron Swanson,"I can speak in full sentences, and I won't cry."
Ben Wyatt,Fair point.
Ben Wyatt,I did cry last time.
Ben Wyatt,Godspeed.
Tom Haverford,Mmm!
Tom Haverford,"Smells amazing, Chef."
Tom Haverford,What you cooking?
Tom Haverford,Little coq au vin?
Tom Haverford,Little bouillabaisse?
Extra,"You can stop the asskissing, Haverford."
Extra,I know why you're here.
Extra,I cannot do the gala.
Extra,It doesn't make business sense to cater something that big for free.
Tom Haverford,Please.
Tom Haverford,"If the gala doesn't go perfectly, the lot could become a Paunch Burger."
Tom Haverford,Doesn't that offend your refined Parisian sensibilities?
Extra,I'm from Orlando.
Extra,And I don't care about the Paunch Burger.
Extra,"If it was another French restaurant, maybe I'd worry."
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"Well, you know what?"
Extra,What?
Extra,What?
Extra,What you got for me?
Extra,Get out of my kitchen!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, okay, okay."
Tom Haverford,"I'm sorry, sorry, sorry."
Tom Haverford,Pardon!
Tom Haverford,Pardon!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, can you hear me?"
Brett,Oh!
Brett,"Leslie, you on the TV!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're on mine, Brett."
Leslie Knope,We're having a video conference.
Brett,"Oh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with the avian flu.
Brett,Tight.
Leslie Knope,"No, this is bad news."
Leslie Knope,I need everyone there at Animal Control to eradicate all the infected birds in town.
Brett,"""Kill all birds."""
Brett,"This is for the drill, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Brett,But I'm actually gonna kill these birds for real?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, just pretend."
Brett,Right.
Brett,"So how do I kill 'em like, with a gun?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Brett,I could fill up a bathtub and just drown 'em one at a time.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's forget we ever talked."
Brett,Got it.
Brett,Kill 'em.
Chris Traeger,"Okay, casualty update only four dead, two of whom were already gravely ill and brothers."
Chris Traeger,That family took a terrible hit.
Chris Traeger,"Well, that's great news."
Leonard Tchulm,Not so fast.
Leonard Tchulm,I regret to inform you that someone in this room has begun exhibiting symptoms  Christopher Traeger.
Leslie Knope,What?
Chris Traeger,"A few months ago, the thought of an infectious disease, even hypothetical, would have sent me careening towards Bummerville, but now I am infected with a killer virus, and I feel fine."
Chris Traeger,Therapy!
Leslie Knope,This is highly irregular.
Leslie Knope,We have followed protocol to the letter.
Leonard Tchulm,"No, you did not."
Leonard Tchulm,"Unfortunately, no one contacted the transit department to shut down bus service."
Leonard Tchulm,"So you rode a bus with a contagious man, and he infected you and 39 others."
Chris Traeger,That is impossible.
Chris Traeger,I do not ride the bus.
Chris Traeger,I ride my bicycle behind the bus as a windbreak.
Leonard Tchulm,Doesn't matter.
Leonard Tchulm,Prepare for the diarrhea.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, who was supposed to deal with Transit?"
Jeremy Jamm,"My bad, guys."
Jeremy Jamm,That's my bad.
Jeremy Jamm,"Chris, very sorry."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,I should've had animal control kill you.
Brett,"Oh, who you want me to kill?"
Leslie Knope,No one.
Brett,I'll kill him As soon as I'm done with these birds.
Ron Swanson,Hello.

Leslie Knope,Let me tell him something important.
Leslie Knope,"Fix it, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,Fix it!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Donna Meagle,"I found one chair, got a lead on a second."
Ben Wyatt,Keep me posted.
Extra,So this test will determine whether you have the right personality profile to be a police officer.
Extra,"Just to make sure the machine is working, is your name Andy?"
Andy Dwyer,I don't know how to answer that.
Extra,"A simple ""yes"" or ""no."""
Andy Dwyer,"Well, everyone calls me Andy, but my full name is Andrew, I think, so No?"
Andy Dwyer,Wait.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Extra,Let's move on.
Extra,Scenario a high school aged child asks to hold your service revolver.
Extra,What do you do?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, I give it to him."
Andy Dwyer,"When I was a kid, I always wanted to hold a cop's gun."
Andy Dwyer,"To make that dream come true for another kid Well, that's what being a cop is all about."
Extra,Scenario you pull a car over for speeding.
Extra,You find out that it's your father.
Extra,How do you handle the situation?
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, first, I would be like, ""Dad You're alive?"""
Andy Dwyer,What the hell?
Andy Dwyer,"Also, do you know where my catcher's mitt is?"
Ron Swanson,Shouldn't you be taking her to lie down somewhere?
Extra,"Oh, no."
Extra,"If she ever found out that we took her off camera, we'd all be fired."
Extra,"So just, uh, keep taking calls."
Extra,You're doing great.
Extra,"Three, two"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, again."
Ron Swanson,"I'm Ron Swanson, and I am still taking your calls hopefully, about tonight's gala."
Ron Swanson,You're on the air.
Extra,"Hi, uh, what's wrong with Joan?"
Ron Swanson,"She has a bad hangover, which she is pretending is allergies."
Extra,Is she gonna be okay?
Ron Swanson,Wouldn't know never been hungover.
Ron Swanson,"After I've had too much whiskey, I cook myself a large flank steak, panfried in salted butter."
Ron Swanson,"I eat that, put on a pair of wet socks, and go to sleep."
Extra,That works?
Ron Swanson,It does.
Ron Swanson,"Please call now if you have questions about tonight's gala or one of my other interests Woodworking, uh, novels about tall ships, meat, that sort of thing."
Chris Traeger,I'm afraid I have some very bad news.
Chris Traeger,"""I, Chris Traeger, after several sustained hours of diarrhea, combined with violent coughing and a devastating fever, followed by even more diarrhea, have succumbed to the avian flu."""
Chris Traeger,I'm dead.
Leslie Knope,"I got to say, Leonard, it kind of feels like you're putting us through the ringer here."
Leslie Knope,Can you us an idea how long this is gonna take?
Leonard Tchulm,Uh Probably six to eight more hours.
Leslie Knope,Eight more hours?
Leonard Tchulm,Nine.
Leslie Knope,Are all state emergency drills this intensive?
Leonard Tchulm,"Oh, no, hardly ever."
Leonard Tchulm,Councilman Jamm requested it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leonard Tchulm,Specifically asked that the drill to be done today and said I should give you everything I got.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Guys!
Leslie Knope,Come here.
Leslie Knope,The game is rigged.
Leslie Knope,"Jamm invited Leonard here, and he screwed up the bus thing on purpose to slow us down."
Leslie Knope,"It is with a heavy heart that I say, ""We have been jammed."""
Ann Perkins,"God, that guy is the worst!"
Ann Perkins,"Look, we are stuck in this room until the drill is over."
Ann Perkins,What are we gonna do?
Leslie Knope,The only thing we can do.
Leslie Knope,In order to save our park We have to destroy the entire town.
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are making some changes to the Knope Protocol."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, how much flu vaccine does the hospital still have?"
Ann Perkins,"Enough for 2,000 people."
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you tell the hospital director  to flush them down the toilet.
Ann Perkins,You got it.
Leslie Knope,"Chief Fugleberg, I want you to order your officers to find all the infected birds in the area and perform CPR."
Chief Fugleberg,Sorry.
Chief Fugleberg,Won't they become infected?
Leslie Knope,That's a risk we're gonna have to take.
Leslie Knope,Our top priority is now saving all the birds.
Leslie Knope,And you know what?
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just kick this up a notch?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has been hit with A tornado quake!
Ron Swanson,This is Ron.
Ron Swanson,"Go ahead, caller."
Extra,Hi.
Extra,My Yorkshire Terrier has chewed up the legs on my kitchen table.
Extra,Is there a cheap way to repair that?
Ron Swanson,Great question.
Ron Swanson,Take a walnut and rub it into the legs of your table.
Ron Swanson,That'll mask the scratches.
Ron Swanson,Next thing you want to do is ditch the Terrier and get yourself a proper dog.
Ron Swanson,"Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat, and cats are pointless."
Ron Swanson,Come to the gala.
Ron Swanson,Next caller.
Ron Swanson,"Grapes of Wrath, chocolatechip ice cream, and Johnny Cash."
Ron Swanson,Don't trust big banks or small banks.
Ron Swanson,Banks are Ponzi schemes run by morons.
Ron Swanson,Your house isn't haunted.
Ron Swanson,You're lonely.
Ron Swanson,"Whatever happened to, ""Hey, I have some apples."""
Ron Swanson,Would you like to buy them?
Ron Swanson,"""Yes, thank you."""
Ron Swanson,That's as complicated as it should be to open a business in this country.
Ron Swanson,"I've seen three movies in my life Bridge on the River Kwai, Patton, and Herbie Fully Loaded."
Ron Swanson,My girlfriend's kids love it.
Ron Swanson,It's pretty funny.
Ron Swanson,Next caller.
Ron Swanson,Good morning.
Chris Traeger,And it is a wrap.
Chris Traeger,Everyone in Pawnee is dead.
Chris Traeger,Including Councilman Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm,What?
Jeremy Jamm,"No, no, you can't do that."
Ann Perkins,"It says right there, you're dead, so is everyone you care about."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, well, joke's on you."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't have anyone I care about.
Leonard Tchulm,"Ms. Knope, I'm afraid I have to once again give Pawnee a failing grade."
Leonard Tchulm, This was bad Fort Wayne bad.
Leslie Knope, Bummer.
Leslie Knope, Thank you for your time.
Leslie Knope, I think we're done here.
Leslie Knope," I will see everyone at the gala, and I will see you in hell."
Jeremy Jamm," Yeah, you're too late, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm, That lot is mine.
Leslie Knope, I can't hear you.
Leslie Knope, I'm a ghost.
Leslie Knope," Yeah, well, so am I, so you can hear me! Ghost jammed!"
Jerry Gergich,We got all the way to Muncie before we realized that it was just a drill.
Jerry Gergich," I mean, all I'm saying is you could've called."
Tom Haverford," No one had your cell number, Big ""J."""
Jerry Gergich,I find that hard to believe.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, why is everyone standing around? We have work to do."
Leslie Knope, Status report.
Leslie Knope,Status report! Well
Leslie Knope,"Nope, we don't have time for that."
Leslie Knope," We're gonna have to postpone the gala, but we can't, because the deadline is tomorrow."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, I destroyed the entire town for nothing."
Ben Wyatt," Leslie, it's okay."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, You did all this? How did you get food? 
Tom Haverford,I had a classic stroke of Haverford genius.
Tom Haverford, Who has the most to lose from a new Paunch Burger? Their competitors.
Tom Haverford, I got all the other fast food places in town to donate food.
Tom Haverford," I know black tie and chicky tenders isn't the best mix, but"
Leslie Knope,"No, Tom, I love it."
Leslie Knope," And more importantly, so will all of our more ample citizens."
Leslie Knope, How did you get the word out?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Ron went on Joan's show and kicked ass."
Ron Swanson, I also helped a child perform a tracheotomy on his elderly uncle.
Ron Swanson, It's been a very rewarding day.
Ben Wyatt," Also, I told the firemen they should use the lot as triage and then gave them and all the dead and wounded two free drink tickets."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope, This is great.
Leslie Knope, Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope, Let's start the gala.
Leslie Knope," Oh, and thanks for dressing up, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, Chief Fugleberg."
Chief Fugleberg,Hey.
Chief Fugleberg," That's your buddy Andy Dwyer over there, isn't it? Such a shame."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,Did he fail his test?
Chief Fugleberg,It's weird.
Chief Fugleberg," He got 100% on his written test, first guy in history to do it, but he failed his personality examination."
Chief Fugleberg," He's a sweet kid, just doesn't have what it takes to be a cop."
Chris Traeger," Oh, Andy."
Chief Fugleberg, Too bad.
Chief Fugleberg, He's certainly something of a genius.
Chief Fugleberg, We could use his brains on the force.
Andy Dwyer, Official police wrist lock.
Andy Dwyer, You can't hit me.
Andy Dwyer, Try to hit me.
Andy Dwyer," Or here, no, try, it's this hand."
Andy Dwyer, Wrist lock.
Andy Dwyer," Boom, too much pain, you can't even hit me."
Andy Dwyer, Try to hit me.
Andy Dwyer," If I had my gun, you wouldn't try to hit me, though, is the thing."
Leslie Knope," Uh, if I could have everyone's attention please? I am so happy to announce that as of one minute ago, we have reached our fundraising goal."
Leslie Knope," Every dollar spent here tonight by you, the community, will be poured right back into this wonderful project."
Leslie Knope," And speaking of community, I'd like to thank my community, my friends."
Leslie Knope," It's a lesson that I have learned over and over again, but it bears repeating, No one achieves anything alone."
Leslie Knope," Without further ado, the best band in Pawnee, Mouse Rat."
Andy Dwyer,"  Park  we will build it, the park   it's not built yet, the park   soon there will be a park"
Andy Dwyer, Thank you.
Ann Perkins,I thought you should see why Leslie tanked the drill.
Ann Perkins," Councilman Jamm used you as a stalling tactic, hoping it would kill Leslie's park project."
Ann Perkins," If the test were any other day, Leslie would have aced it."
Leonard Tchulm, I believe you.
Leonard Tchulm, Maybe I'll find my way back here in a month for a redo.
Ann Perkins, I appreciate it.
Ann Perkins, Have you ever thought of being a sperm donor?
Leonard Tchulm, I'm impotent.
Ann Perkins," Yeah, I don't need to know that."
Leslie Knope, This is the best wedding present ever.
Leslie Knope, This is the best night ever.
Leslie Knope, I wish we were getting married tonight.
Ben Wyatt," Well, we only have three more months."
Leslie Knope, I can't wait three more months.
Leslie Knope," God, I just hate the feeling of not being married to you."
Ben Wyatt," Well Let's just do it, then."
Ben Wyatt," Let's get married Here, tonight."
Ben Wyatt," I mean, we're all in black tie."
Ben Wyatt," We've got plenty of food and entertainment And you did want to invite the whole town to the wedding, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Let's get married Tonight.
Leslie Knope,"Breaking news, I've just been handed this."
Leslie Knope, Pawnee has been hit by a devastating earthquake.
Leslie Knope," We go to our reporter, live, Winnifred Makepiece, for the story."
Leslie Knope, Winnifred?
Leslie Knope," Thanks, Jessica."
Leslie Knope, I'm here at the Pawnee Weather Center with celebrated geologist Isabella Winchester.
Leslie Knope," Isabella, can you tell us more about this killer earthquake?"
Leslie Knope,"That's right, Winnifred, the earthquake registered an 8."
Leslie Knope,5 on the Richter scale.
Leslie Knope, That's correct.
Leslie Knope, It was a large one.
Leslie Knope," Thank you so much, everyone."
Leslie Knope," From all of us here at Channel 4 News, I'm Jessica Rabrit."
Leslie Knope, Have a good evening and be safe out there.

Leslie Knope,I wish we were getting married tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just do it then.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie Let's get married.
Ben Wyatt,Tonight.
Leslie Knope,Are we really doing this?
Ben Wyatt,I guess
Ben Wyatt,Why not?
Ben Wyatt,The gala ends at 11:00.
Ben Wyatt,"At 11:01, we get married."
Leslie Knope,"Okay But, wait, my mom isn't here."
Leslie Knope,And your parents aren't here.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that makes it better."
Leslie Knope,But we reserved a space for May 16th.
Leslie Knope,And we just ordered  200 white chocolate top hats.
Ben Wyatt,We did?
Leslie Knope,"You did, actually."
Leslie Knope,It's under your name.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, we can get married May 16th, or June 1st, or July 57th."
Ben Wyatt,"But doesn't it feel right, today?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it does."
Leslie Knope,"Every time you say it, it just feels more right."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, we're getting married tonight."
Leslie Knope,This is really great.

Ben Wyatt,"it was my idea, I'm totally in."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no."
Leslie Knope,We can't this is our wedding day.
Leslie Knope,"This is very bad luck, turn around."
Leslie Knope,We can't look at each other!
Ben Wyatt,"Well, you are aware that we've seen each other several times today."
Leslie Knope,We have two hours to do this.
Leslie Knope,"I want you to get everyone together, and meet me at Ann's house in ten minutes."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, wait, before we get married, there is something we need to discuss."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we've never talked about it, but I really want you to take my last name."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it's just really important to me, symbolically, that Leslie Knope disappears and becomes Leslie Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,Or Councilwoman Mrs. Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,That's fine too.
Ben Wyatt,It's a deal breaker.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, are you messing with me?"
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I had to give it a shot."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, now go, run!"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,Where do I go?
Leslie Knope,Run!
Ben Wyatt,The falcon is entering!
Leslie Knope,The turtledove acknowledges!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, where are you?"
Ben Wyatt,I'm I'm here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's go over the duties right now."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're in charge of the dress and the hair and the makeup."
Leslie Knope,"And I was thinking, like, the sensuality of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with the animal magnetism of Lesley Stahl."
Ann Perkins,Piece of cake.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, we have to get the wedding cake."
Ann Perkins,I'll do that too.
Ann Perkins,I'm perfectly calm.
Ann Perkins,"I feel like every crazy thing Leslie's ever had me do has been, like a drill, and today is the real thing."
Ann Perkins,"I'm ready, because I had the greatest teacher in the world."
Ann Perkins,Leslie.
Ann Perkins,Who is crazy.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, we need rings and marriage licenses."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, let me be on rings."
Chris Traeger,I love what they symbolize.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Andy Dwyer,And I can do the license.
Andy Dwyer,I got a guy that works at City Hall.
Andy Dwyer,That guy's my wife.
April Ludgate,"Um, you also work there."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I'm gonna need you to walk me down the aisle."
Ron Swanson,"It would be an honor, and the first time I won't regret walking down the aisle."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh, yikes."
Ben Wyatt,We need an officiant.
Tom Haverford,I got this.
Tom Haverford,"You can become an ordained minister online in, like, five minutes."
Tom Haverford,Do you want more like a Steve Harvey vibe or straight up Seacrest?
Tom Haverford,Nuh!
Tom Haverford,Never mind.
Tom Haverford,I'll combine 'em Stevecrest.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and, um, Jerry and Donna, I need you guys to just make sure that the gala runs smoothly."
Leslie Knope,Let's say that we're all gonna meet back here in an hour.
Leslie Knope,I love all of you.
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, break!"
Ben Wyatt,Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,We're looking for a couple wedding rings.
Herman,You're gonna wanna look through the jewelry and nails tray.
Herman,There is some beautiful jewelry in here.
Herman,But be careful.
Herman,There's also nails.
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,"Oh, these aren't bad."
Herman,Those are real nice.
Herman,"And they were nipple rings, at one point."
Ben Wyatt,How do you know that?
Herman,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,They were yours.
Ben Wyatt,They were his.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, it's pretty crazy, I'm gonna be a cop tomorrow."
Andy Dwyer,I guess I better commit as many crimes as possible tonight.
Andy Dwyer,Get it out of my system.
April Ludgate,"Ooh, found the marriage licenses."
April Ludgate,And I am going to take all of them.
April Ludgate,"I don't want anyone else in this town to get married, because it makes it less special for us."
Andy Dwyer,"Good call, babe."
Andy Dwyer,Let's roll.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I'm good!
Leslie Knope,It's not finished.
Leslie Knope,Why didn't the seamstress finish it?
Leslie Knope,"If you're not gonna finish something three months early, then don't accept the job."
Ann Perkins,There's got to be something we can do.
Leslie Knope,This wedding is meant to be.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna figure it out.
Leslie Knope,Now how did Cinderella finish her dress so fast?
Leslie Knope,Squirrels and birds.
Ann Perkins,Mm.
Leslie Knope,That's not very helpful.
Ann Perkins,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, we got it!"
April Ludgate,We got it.
Andy Dwyer,Marriage license done.
Leslie Knope,"Wait a minute, hold on."
Leslie Knope,It needs to be signed by somebody at the City Clerk's Office.
April Ludgate,I'll just forge it.
April Ludgate,I forge government documents all the time.
Andy Dwyer,That's true.
April Ludgate,Boom.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,So we didn't find any rings.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we're having a few roadblocks here."
Leslie Knope,Kind of feels like this thing is falling apart.
Ben Wyatt,Don't panic.
Ben Wyatt,I swear there's some rings in this old box of stuff my mom gave me.
Ben Wyatt,Still here at April and Andy's house.
Ben Wyatt,Want to come help me look?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ann, dress duty."
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, license duty."
Leslie Knope,No time for verbs.
Andy Dwyer,"I know you're in a rush, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"I should point out that you said ""duty"" twice."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Donna Meagle,"Aw, shucks, business is boomin'."
Jerry Gergich,Indiana celebrity lookalikes.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, this is a brilliant idea, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,All my favorites are here.
Jerry Gergich,"We got Orville Redenbacher, La Toya Jackson, Axl Rose, David Letterman."
Donna Meagle,"Look, don't tell anyone, but I booked a special surprise."
Donna Meagle,There's a Li'l Sebastian lookalike on the way what?
Jerry Gergich,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my Oh!"
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Donna Meagle,Did you just pee your pants?
Jerry Gergich,Just a dab.
Jerry Gergich,I better go clean up.
Donna Meagle,"You nasty, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Third time this week.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, what the hell!"
Jerry Gergich,What's wrong?
Tom Haverford,"""Your Minister Certification will be emailed to you in 24 hours."""
Tom Haverford,Uhh!
Tom Haverford,But this is America.
Tom Haverford,I want it now!
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, Tom, that's what happens."
Tom Haverford,I had all these great bits written for the wedding too.
Tom Haverford,I was gonna beatbox.
Tom Haverford,There's a dance breakdown.
Tom Haverford,"I'm talking, like, six guaranteed applause breaks."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, you know, I am actually ordained."
Jerry Gergich,I could do the wedding.
Tom Haverford,That's the worst idea I've ever heard.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, you're right, okay."
Tom Haverford,Wait!
Tom Haverford,"What if you do the ceremony, but you don't have any stupid ideas of your own, and you just say the stuff that I came up with?"
Jerry Gergich,Anything to help Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Perfect.
Tom Haverford,Now shut up and start memorizing.
Tom Haverford,We open with Will Smith's monologue from the modern cinematic classic Hitch.
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove?
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove.
Leslie Knope,Falcon?
Ben Wyatt,Turtledove.
Leslie Knope,There's your butt.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Did you find the rings?
Ben Wyatt,"No rings, just a tennis bracelet and a necklace that says ""Wine Chick."""
Leslie Knope,"No rings, no license, no dress."
Leslie Knope,"This idea felt so right, but maybe it's just too crazy."
Leslie Knope,Maybe it wasn't meant to be.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, it's snowing."
Leslie Knope,It's him.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Who?
Ben Wyatt,I can't see.
Leslie Knope,"I don't understand, this is impossible."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Li'l Sebastian?
Extra,"No, no, sorry."
Extra,"Actually, this is Bucky."
Extra,"He's a, uh, licensed Li'l Sebastian impersonator."
Extra,"We're headed to the gala, so folks can pose for pictures with him."
Extra,"200 a pop, if you're interested."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, you."
Leslie Knope,"This is Li'l Sebastian, and this is a sign."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do this.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna pull this wedding off.
Extra,"Come on, Bucky."
Leslie Knope,Li'l Sebastian.
Extra,"Yes, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,"Oh my God, we're running out of time."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, please, tell me that you have sewn a new dress from scratch."
Leslie Knope,"Or several dresses, 'cause I would love some options."
Ann Perkins,"I have an idea, and it might be insane, but I've been watching a lot Project Runway recently In the past eight years."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great, so I trust you, and make it work."
Leslie Knope,No time to do the Tim Gunn voice.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what am I talking about?"
Leslie Knope,There's always time.
Leslie Knope,"Designers, make it work."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you have less than an hour."
Andy Dwyer,"Miss Beavers, this is official police business."
Andy Dwyer,I hope we didn't wake you up.
Ethel Beavers,It's after 10:00.
Ethel Beavers,I've been asleep for four hours.
Ethel Beavers,What do you want?
April Ludgate,We need you to sign this.
April Ludgate,It's a marriage license.
Extra,Ethel?
Extra,Is it robbers?
Ethel Beavers,"No, go back to bed."
Andy Dwyer,"Aww, is that your husband?"
Ethel Beavers,I'm not married.
Ethel Beavers,I was on a date tonight.
Ethel Beavers,"It went well, he's sleeping over."
April Ludgate,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,It'd really mean a lot if you sign it.
Andy Dwyer,It's for Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt.
Andy Dwyer,I think you know them?
Ethel Beavers,"They dragged me out in the freezing cold once, so they could tell each other ""I love you."""
Ethel Beavers,It was annoying.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank you so much!"
Andy Dwyer,You have got an amazing house and a really cool nightgown and seem to be super good at dating.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, so can we adopt you as our grandma?"
Ethel Beavers,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,Cool!
Andy Dwyer,"We love you, Grandma!"
Ben Wyatt,"I guess we could go to a pharmacy, but I really don't want to use like a cheap plastic ring."
Chris Traeger,"I hate to say this, but Ann Perkins has terrible taste in rings."
Chris Traeger,What what is this?
Chris Traeger,It's a toe ring with a brown gemstone?
Chris Traeger,Is this a ruby that's gone bad?
Ben Wyatt,I am out of ideas.
Ben Wyatt,Jewelry store.
Ben Wyatt,"No, that's closed, that's why we're doing this."
Ron Swanson,Perhaps I can be of service.
Ben Wyatt,How?
Ron Swanson,How much do you think Ann would miss this sconce?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I don't know."
Ben Wyatt,It's part of her house.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, okay."
Jerry Gergich,"""When I heard Ben was getting married, I was like, 'to Leslie or to Game of Thrones'?"""
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, horrible delivery."
Jerry Gergich,"""You ever heard Leslie talk about Ben's butt?"""
Jerry Gergich,"""I'm all like, 'damn, girl, you mad sweet on that back meat."""
Tom Haverford,You're murdering my beautiful words!
Tom Haverford,Do you even want to kill at this wedding?
Jerry Gergich,I just want Leslie and Ben to have a nice night.
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford,"I  No, no."
Tom Haverford,It's my fault for believing in you.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, look, um, to be official, I just have to do the vows and the pronouncement."
Jerry Gergich,"So why don't you handle the speech, and then I'll just come in at the end?"
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm not crazy about the part where you do something."
Tom Haverford,"But, I do like the idea me doing something."
Tom Haverford,Let's give it a shot.
Donna Meagle,"Hello, everyone."
Donna Meagle,Got some bad news.
Donna Meagle,The gala ends at 11:00.
Donna Meagle,"The good news is, at 11:01, we'll be holding a special wedding ceremony."
Donna Meagle,Everyone is invited to stay.
Donna Meagle,All the drinks and the food will be on us.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, everything going okay?"
Donna Meagle,Everything would be peachy if it weren't for that dumbass with a megaphone.
Jeremy Jamm,No one wants a park here.
Jeremy Jamm,Parks are stupid.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, butterteeth, what's up?"
Jeremy Jamm,I can fix those chompers for you.
Jeremy Jamm,Just come to Jamm Orthodontics.
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, what are you doing here?"
Jeremy Jamm,What are you doing here?
Jeremy Jamm,Parks are stupid.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, enough."
Jeremy Jamm,You better give me back that megaphone.
Jeremy Jamm,That belongs to my aunt.
Leslie Knope,Why don't I call you a cab?
Jeremy Jamm,Mm.
Jeremy Jamm,"No, this isn't over, Knope."
Leslie Knope,It is over.
Leslie Knope,I won fair and square.
Leslie Knope,"And, in a half an hour, I am getting married over there to the most perfect man in the world."
Leslie Knope,And all my dreams are coming true.
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks."
Leslie Knope,"Knope rules, Jamm Councilman Howser."
Councilman Howser,Leslie.
Councilman Howser,Jeremy.
Jeremy Jamm,You better make sure my aunt gets her megaphone back.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, did I did I do it right?"
Ben Wyatt,How's it look?
Chris Traeger,Terrible.
Chris Traeger,And perfect.
Chris Traeger,I promised myself I was not going to cry tonight.
Chris Traeger,And I have already broken that promise five times.
Chris Traeger,But I will not break it a sixth.
Ben Wyatt,"Go ahead and let it out, buddy."
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Chris Traeger,I have something for you.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Chris Traeger,It is the letter from the statehouse Telling us that we have been assigned to Pawnee.
Chris Traeger,"Dated may 1st, 2010."
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Chris Traeger,We were supposed to be here eight weeks.
Chris Traeger,"I'm so happy that those eight weeks turned into three years, and that you met Leslie, and that we both found a home."
Ben Wyatt,"Damn it, you're transferring your crying thing over to me."
Chris Traeger,"It's okay, buddy, let it out."
Ann Perkins,"I gathered up all the meaningful bills, pictures, documents, and memos from your career."
Ann Perkins,What do you think?
Ann Perkins,Is it okay?
Leslie Knope,It is the most beautiful object I have ever seen.
Leslie Knope,It is like the Ann Perkins of dresses.
Ann Perkins,Yay.
Ann Perkins,It is amazing.
Andy Dwyer,All set.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, wow!"
Andy Dwyer,You look amazing.
Ann Perkins,Right?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,I'm not supposed to see you before the wedding.
April Ludgate,"No, that's the groom"
Andy Dwyer,I ruined it!
April Ludgate,"Andy, that's the groom."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I saw him too."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm just gonna cover my eyes, just to be safe."
April Ludgate,"Okay, so we're ready out there."
April Ludgate,For your wedding or whatever.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, the license, the rings, the officiant, everything?"
April Ludgate,"Yes, it all came together."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, boo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, Leslie Knope, boo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Here comes the boo   all dressed in boo   boo, Leslie Knope   boo, boooooooo  Boo!"
Ben Wyatt,"Dude, what are you doing?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm being awesome.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boo, boo, Leslie, boo."
Ron Swanson,"My friend, I don't think you understand what a bad idea this is."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't think you understand that I would have got a cut of that new Paunch Burger if she hadn't screwed everything up.
Jeremy Jamm,"So sorry, guys!"
Jeremy Jamm,"This wedding is canceled, 'cause the bride is a bhole."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,Check this out.
Jeremy Jamm,Stink bomb!
Jeremy Jamm,Who knows what that does?
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Stink bomb?
Ann Perkins,Are you joking?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Where did you even get a stink bomb?
Jeremy Jamm,"Amazon, baby, that's how."
Jeremy Jamm,"You are looking at a prime customer, everybody."
Jeremy Jamm,Two days free shipping for this guy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's get this party started with another one, gang!"
Ben Wyatt,No!
Tom Haverford,It's terrible!
Tom Haverford,"Jerry, you do the wedding."
Tom Haverford,Who cares?
Ben Wyatt,"Come on, man, just go home."
Jeremy Jamm,And who's gonna make me?
Ron Swanson,It's your wedding day.
Ron Swanson,I'll handle this.
Jeremy Jamm,Here comes the bride.
Ron Swanson,"Time to go, sir."
Jeremy Jamm,No.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, get off me, what the hell, man?"
Jeremy Jamm,Don't you touch me.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ron Swanson,I'll give you that one.
Ron Swanson,But if you do it again 
Jeremy Jamm,If I do what again?
Jeremy Jamm,"What, kick your ass?"
Jeremy Jamm,Is that what you like?
Jeremy Jamm,You want me to just pound
Ben Wyatt,Ooh!
Jeremy Jamm,Ow.
April Ludgate,"Yay, best wedding ever."
Jeremy Jamm,Ow.
Jeremy Jamm,You broke my tooth.
Leslie Knope,"Well, good thing you're an orthodontist."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it is a good thing."
Jeremy Jamm,You see my house?
Jeremy Jamm,Five bathrooms.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,For what?
Ron Swanson,"I've never presented a bride on her wedding day, so I'm not 100% sure of the duties involved, but I don't think you're supposed to punch a man in the mouth during the service."
Leslie Knope,"I think that's exactly what you're supposed to do, if that mouth is attached to a drunk jerk face."
Ron Swanson,"Well, please, don't worry about me."
Ron Swanson,Just go and get married.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ron Swanson,Leslie.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope,Listen to me very carefully.
Leslie Knope,"I lost my father when I was ten, I don't have any brothers, and Ken Burns never wrote me back."
Leslie Knope,So I am not getting married without you there to walk me down the aisle.
Leslie Knope,End of discussion.
Andy Dwyer,"Better get used to this, honey."
Andy Dwyer,Gonna be a lot of late nights for me here.
Andy Dwyer,Graveyard shift.
Andy Dwyer,You coming to bring me coffee while I interrogate murderers.
April Ludgate,"You've had all night to get something out of him, Dwyer,  we gotta let him go."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, Captain."
Andy Dwyer,I'm this close to getting a confession.
April Ludgate,"You're never gonna break him, Dwyer."
April Ludgate,He's a psychopath.
April Ludgate,"He chopped off both of his arms, so he wouldn't leave any fingerprints."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, he did?"
Andy Dwyer,"Well, how did he murder the person?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Chief Fugleberg."
Andy Dwyer,"It's me, Andy Dwyer, pre reporting for duty."
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, about my new partner."
Andy Dwyer,Is it a dog?
Chief Fugleberg," Oh, has Chris Traeger not told you?"
Andy Dwyer, Told me what?
Ann Perkins," Hey, Ron, we posted bail."
Ann Perkins, You're free to go.
Jeremy Jamm,"Wait a minute, what? He punched me in the teeth."
Jeremy Jamm, This is an outrage.
Extra, I think we have a pretty clear picture of what went down.
Extra," Sleep it off in the cell, Councilman."
Ann Perkins," Leslie, I'm so sorry."
Ann Perkins, I think we missed it.
Ann Perkins," The gala's over, they're taking it all down."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, it's okay."
Leslie Knope," I mean, I guess it just wasn't meant to be, after all."
Leslie Knope, We'll get married in May like we planned.
Ann Perkins," You know what? I have some champagne, back at the office."
Ann Perkins," Let's go back there, have a drink, toast to Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope, Fun.
Leslie Knope, That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope," It'll be good, 'cause I actually have some work I need to get started on."
Jeremy Jamm, I got five bathrooms.
Leslie Knope, I love the first floor of City Hall at night.
Leslie Knope, When all the fluorescents are half-off.
Leslie Knope, Just makes the informational fliers look so beautiful.
Ron Swanson, I've never willingly been here later than 5:04 p.m.
Ron Swanson," Before we go inside, I'd like to say something."
Ron Swanson, You are a wonderful person.
Ron Swanson, Your friendship means a lot to me.
Ron Swanson, And you look very beautiful.
Leslie Knope," Okay, weirdo."
Leslie Knope, Let's go.
Leslie Knope," Hoo, boy."
Ron Swanson, All set?
Tom Haverford,"Mmhmm Jerry, everything I wrote is wrong."
Tom Haverford," There's, like, 20 minutes of Hitch quotes before I even say Leslie's name."
Tom Haverford, What do I do?
Jerry Gergich,"You know what, Tom? Just speak from the heart, okay? You'll do great."
Tom Haverford, We are gathered here tonight to join Leslie Knope and Benjamin Wyatt in marriage.
Tom Haverford, It's been a long and winding road for these two lovebirds.
Tom Haverford, And they're so impatient to begin their lives together they've moved their wedding date up three months.
Tom Haverford," So I say, let's keep it short and sweet."
April Ludgate," Yes, just do it already."
Tom Haverford," I assume, and hope, you prepared your own vows? Ben, you want to say some stuff about Leslie?"
Ben Wyatt," In my time working for the state government, my job sent me to 46 cities in 11 years."
Ben Wyatt," I lived in villages with eight people, rural farming communities, college towns."
Ben Wyatt, I was sent to every corner of Indiana.
Ben Wyatt, And then I came here.
Ben Wyatt," And I realized that, this whole time, I was just wandering around, everywhere, just looking for you."
Tom Haverford," Leslie, do you want to say some stuff about Ben now?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages."
Leslie Knope, But I don't have them with me today.
Leslie Knope, Although maybe there's a copy of them in my office.
April Ludgate, No.
Ben Wyatt," That's fine, that's fine."
Ben Wyatt,I think we can just keep going.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope," Here's what I'll say, then."
Leslie Knope," The things that you have done for me, to help me, support me, surprise me, to make me happy, go above and beyond what any person deserves."
Leslie Knope, You're all I need.
Leslie Knope, I love you and I like you.
Ben Wyatt, I love you and I like you.
Jerry Gergich," And now, with the power vested in me by the state of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife."
Jerry Gergich," You may now kiss the well, oops, okay."
Ron Swanson,Lagavulin all around? Don't bother answering.
Ron Swanson, I am already pouring.
Ron Swanson, You don't have to drink yours.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer," Just this once, I thought I nailed something."
April Ludgate," Well, I'm still proud of you."
April Ludgate, You worked hard and you got really close.
Andy Dwyer, Close only counts in horse grenades.
April Ludgate,What?
Andy Dwyer,It's a saying.
Andy Dwyer," Because if you're playing horseshoes, and then you throw a grenade at a horse, it doesn't have to be that close, and you can still blow the horse's legs off."
Andy Dwyer, It's from the movie Seabiscuit.
Chris Traeger, How's it going in here?
April Ludgate,Good.
April Ludgate, I was just telling Andy that I'm proud of him.
Andy Dwyer, Oh.
Andy Dwyer," And I was just explaining to April that I'm a failure, and she should leave me for Orin."
Chris Traeger," Andy, this is a very important moment for you."
Chris Traeger, How we deal with tragedy defines who we are.
Chris Traeger, I used to be terrible at it.
Chris Traeger, Beyond terrible.
Chris Traeger, You are not going to let this deflate you.
Chris Traeger," You are going to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and we will figure out what the next step is."
Ann Perkins, Chris can be very Paternal.
Andy Dwyer, I look around this room.
Andy Dwyer," If it weren't for Leslie Knope, none of us would be here."
Andy Dwyer," So, Leslie, this song, which is for Li'l Sebastian, is for you."
Donna Meagle,"  Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing   you trade your legs for angel's wings   and once we've all said good-bye   you take a running leap, and you learn to fly"
Andy Dwyer,"Bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian, miss you in the saddest fashion"
Leslie Knope,There were a lot of signs that Ben and I miss you in the saddest fashion should get married tonight.
Leslie Knope," But, truth be told, we just really wanted to get married."
Leslie Knope," When you're in love, everything seems like a sign."
Leslie Knope, I love my husband.
Leslie Knope, I love my job.
Leslie Knope, And I love my friends.
Leslie Knope, Even though they really can't handle their booze.
Ben Wyatt," Hey, we should just go, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Careful.
Andy Dwyer,  Spread your wings and fly   spread your wings and fly
Ron Swanson,It's not rocket science.
Ron Swanson," I removed the sconce Fired up my grandfather's torch, heated up the pieces in a cast-iron bucket."
Ron Swanson, Liquefied the metal.
Ron Swanson, Pour it into a mold.
Ron Swanson, Obviously keep it over a low flame to achieve a nice temper.
Ron Swanson, Cooled it in antifreeze.
Ron Swanson, And just forged and shaped the rings.
Ron Swanson," Any moron with a crucible, an acetylene torch, and a cast-iron waffle maker could have done the same."
Ron Swanson, Whole thing only took me about 20 minutes.
Ron Swanson, People who buy things are suckers.

Leslie Knope,"Well, the honeymoon was amazing."
Leslie Knope,We saw the bus stop where a young Barack Obama used to sit and wait for the bus.
Leslie Knope,Theoretically.
Ben Wyatt,It's possible.
Leslie Knope,Then we went and visited Honolulu City Hall.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,You know.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, what was it like?"
Leslie Knope,It was amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it looked amazing, but it was closed."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, bummer."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I have presents!"
Leslie Knope,"Um Chris, we got you an Acai tree because the Acai berry is a superfood."
Chris Traeger,And a super gift.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, we got you some coffee, because you said, and I quote, ""I like my coffee like I like my men."
Leslie Knope,"Dark, rich, and full bodied."""
Donna Meagle,"Yes, indeed."
Leslie Knope,"Ann, we got you some very rare Hawaiian fertility tea, guaranteed to help you have a baby."
Ann Perkins,That's so nice.
Ann Perkins,Where'd you find that?
Leslie Knope,"Well, the busboy at our restaurant told us about a guy who we met in a parking lot, and then he had a backpack full of this stuff, and I'm just realizing now that it's not tea."
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna throw it away.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, this is the Hawaiian god of anger."
Ben Wyatt,It reminded us of you when you're at work.
Ron Swanson,A handsome gentleman.
Leslie Knope,We did not forget Jerry.
Ben Wyatt,"Right, right."
Leslie Knope,"We got Jerry some earbuds, and a bag of peanuts, and the Skymall catalog."
Jerry Gergich,Same thing you got me from your trip to Washington!
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, we got you an autographed portrait of your personal hero."
Tom Haverford,No way!
Tom Haverford,Scott Caan from Hawaii five0!
Ben Wyatt,"April, as requested, we threw that box you gave us into that volcano."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, as you requested, got you a three pack of white Tshirts from Target."
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,All mine are dirty.
Andy Dwyer,"Thank you, Hawaii."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,It's great to be here at the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,"There's so many wonderful, talented journalists here."
Leslie Knope,Also here are some reporters from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,I love the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Some people say that it's a useless tabloid.
Leslie Knope,But I don't think it's useless.
Leslie Knope,I think it's great for housebreaking puppies.
Leslie Knope,I am prepping for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.
Leslie Knope,It's an annual affair where the media and the government roast each other.
Leslie Knope,My number one target the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,they rake me over the coals.
Leslie Knope,"Today, I take those burning coals, I shove them back down their throats, and I watch their melting flesh drip off their worthless faces!"
Leslie Knope,It's all in good fun.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need more jokes, people."
Leslie Knope,"Ben is having his first day at work, so he cannot help me."
Leslie Knope,So I need you guys to pick up the slack.
Ron Swanson,I have a joke for you.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Ron Swanson,The government in this town is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently.
Leslie Knope,"That's not really a joke, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I disagree.
Ron Swanson,I find it hilarious.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Chris!"
Ann Perkins,Got to run to a meeting.
Ann Perkins,With Ron.
Chris Traeger,Great idea!
Chris Traeger,I'll run to my next meeting.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, the door was open."
Ron Swanson,I wish this office had only walls.
Ann Perkins,"Chris broke up with his girlfriend a week ago, and I have decided to ask him to be the father of my baby."
Ann Perkins,Except I cannot work up the nerve to do it.
Ann Perkins,Turns out they don't make greeting cards for asking your exboyfriend if he will artificially inseminate you.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, Ron, I could use your advice on how to be blunt and honest."
Ann Perkins,"I want my friend to do something for me, and I don't know how to ask him."
Ron Swanson,What do you want him to do?
Ann Perkins,Plant ficuses.
Ann Perkins,In my front yard.
Ann Perkins,Grossest metaphor ever.
Ron Swanson,I've seen your house.
Ron Swanson,You'd have more success if he planted ficuses in your backyard.
Ann Perkins,"No, I don't think so."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, what if he thinks I'm asking too much of him, and I ask him to plant the ficuses, and he doesn't want to, and he gets weird about it, and it ruins our friendship?"
Ron Swanson,Then plant the damn ficuses yourself.
Ann Perkins,I wish that were possible.
Jessica Wicks,We are so excited to have you working with us here at the allnew Sweetums Foundation.
Jessica Wicks,This is your office.
Ben Wyatt,This is incredible.
Ben Wyatt,And look at that art.
Jessica Wicks,"Ah, yes."
Jessica Wicks,My late husband.
Jessica Wicks,He was so decrepit.
Ben Wyatt,I really like helping people.
Ben Wyatt,Running the new Sweetums Foundation charity allows me to do that and work in an office with more mahogany wood than currently remains in the Amazon rain forest.
Ben Wyatt,"So, win win."
Ben Wyatt,Except for the rain forest.
Jessica Wicks,I need you to select your first charity by tomorrow.
Jessica Wicks,Sweetums' public image is currently at an alltime low.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, there's even a rumor going around that the chocolate is made of rat parts."
Jessica Wicks,Well You know what they say about rumors.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,They're mostly true.
Ben Wyatt,Including the rat thing?
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,What are you gonna do?
Jessica Wicks,It's where all the flavor comes from.
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, would you look at that."
Jessica Wicks,There is a smudge on my tail.
Jessica Wicks,Oh!
Jessica Wicks,All better.
Extra,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, where politicians and the media make fun of each other."
Extra,"But, if you ask me, we should be making fun of the food."
Extra,"""I am not the cook."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, well, well."
Leslie Knope,If it isn't Kim Terlando from the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Do you happen to have a can opener?
Leslie Knope,'Cause I'm about to open this on you.
Kim Terlando,"Did you make that can of ""whoop ass"" for this exact moment?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I came prepared."
Kim Terlando,I'd expect nothing less.
Kim Terlando,Good luck with your speech.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck."
Leslie Knope,It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, look, it has one."
Leslie Knope,That's how ready I am.
Kim Terlando,I'm glad you're so confident.
Kim Terlando,Nice to see you.
Leslie Knope,It was nice to see you too.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, can I talk to you for a second?"
Chris Traeger,Absolutely.
Chris Traeger,I cannot wait.
Chris Traeger,One second.
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, sir."
Chris Traeger,I think I accidentally got the meat option.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, and I got the veggie option."
Chris Traeger,"Shauna MalwaeTweep, my exgirlfriend."
Chris Traeger,It seems like you and I have a classic mix 'em up.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Yeah, fancy meeting you here."
Chris Traeger,"This isn't awkward for you, is it?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Chris, it's okay."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,You wanna switch?

Ben Wyatt,"I'm super swamped, and I need your help."
April Ludgate,Pass.
Ben Wyatt,You came down here to pass on helping me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I wanted to see what your face looked like when I said no."
April Ludgate,It was totally worth it.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, are you okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,It's just that life is pointless and nothing matters and I'm always tired.
Andy Dwyer,"Also, I can't sleep, I'm overeating, none of my old hobbies interest me."
April Ludgate,"Ever since Andy failed the police academy exam, his selfesteem has hit rock bottom."
April Ludgate,He's always sad and sweaty.
April Ludgate,He's usually happy and sweaty.
Ben Wyatt,"I have to pick our first charity by tomorrow, and there's a million applications."
Ben Wyatt,Can you guys help me sort 'em out?
April Ludgate,You know what?
April Ludgate,This sounds like fun.
April Ludgate,"Babe, come on."
April Ludgate,Let's help him.
April Ludgate,It'll be fun.
Tom Haverford,"Well, it sounds like you guys got it covered."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna head out.
Tom Haverford,Actually have my own charity to attend to.
Tom Haverford,Tommy's tummy foundation.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, they bring me fancy lunches here."

Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"Crab, caviar?"
Tom Haverford,"On behalf of Tommy's tummy foundation, I'm happy to accept this generous donation."
Extra,Please welcome Kim Terlando.
Kim Terlando,"Thank you, Martin."
Kim Terlando,It's nice to be here among all of these excellent journalists.
Kim Terlando,And also the people that work with me over at the Pawnee Sun.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,That was my opener.
Kim Terlando,"Now I love working at the Sun, okay?"
Kim Terlando,"And I know you all think it's just a useless tabloid, but it's not."
Kim Terlando,It is great.
Kim Terlando,For housebreaking puppies.
Leslie Knope,Those are my jokes.
Leslie Knope,She's stealing my jokes.
Kim Terlando,Some people say that the Sun has a problem with the truth.
Kim Terlando,"There's no problem, we just ignore it."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, stop laughing."
Leslie Knope,Those are stolen jokes!
Leslie Knope,Totally dead.
Leslie Knope,What am I gonna do?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"I just opened up a can of ""whoop ass"" on myself!"
Councilman Milton,I remember the very first Correspondents' Lunch.
Councilman Milton,I rode here in a horse and buggy.
Councilman Milton,"No, no, no, that wasn't a joke."
Councilman Milton,I actually did.
Councilman Milton,That also was not a joke.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, Kim told all my jokes, all of them."
Leslie Knope,She must have gotten a copy of my speech.
Leslie Knope,Did anybody lose their copy?
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Chris Traeger,Right here.
Ron Swanson,Mine is right here.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, jeez."
Leslie Knope,Go stand in the corner and think about what you've done.
Leslie Knope,And no dessert!
Leslie Knope,"I need new material, and it needs to be great, and it needs to knock people on their butts, and it needs to transcend the genre of roast comedy."
Leslie Knope,"Perkins, go."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, wow."
Ann Perkins,"Um, okay, so Councilman Milton is old, right?"
Ann Perkins,And he's wearing a green tie.
Ann Perkins,"So, like, maybe there's something there, where, like, he went to school with his high school buddies that were dinosaurs."
Ann Perkins,And his tie is green.
Ann Perkins,They're green.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Ann, you're too beautiful to be funny."
Leslie Knope,It's not your fault.
Leslie Knope,You've never had to compensate for anything.
Leslie Knope,The rest of you ugly nerds need to give me some jokes stat.
Andy Dwyer,Ben?
Andy Dwyer,Ben?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,I think I might have found something that's actually pretty cool.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, just put it aside, and I'll read it later."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"Andy found it, and he's gonna tell you about it right now."
April Ludgate,"Go, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, it's the Redwood Music Program."
Andy Dwyer,It's an after school music class for at risk kids.
Andy Dwyer,It'll keep them off the street.
April Ludgate,Whoa.
Andy Dwyer,"And the streets, as you know, are dangerous."
Andy Dwyer,Example I fell in a sewer grate once.
Andy Dwyer,I was there all day.
Andy Dwyer,"In conclusion, we cannot let our children live in the sewer any longer."
Andy Dwyer,"Redwood Music Program go, your honor, amen."
Ben Wyatt,That's a great idea.
Ben Wyatt,Anyone else come across anything good?
Ben Wyatt,Tom?
Tom Haverford,"Um, yeah."
Tom Haverford,I got a good one.
Tom Haverford,It's called the Clean Sheet Foundation.
Tom Haverford,That's my pick.
Ben Wyatt,They provide legal assistance to the KKK.
Ben Wyatt,This is your pick?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Can you pass the bonbons?
Joan Callamezzo,Perd Hapley is here today.
Joan Callamezzo,"Or, as Perd would say, ""My name is Perd Hapley, and the person I see here today is me."""
Perd Hapley,Everyone seems to be laughing now.
Ann Perkins,Do you see what is happening with Chris and Shauna?
Ann Perkins,They are flirting like crazy.
Ann Perkins,It's disgusting.
Ann Perkins,They're in public.
Ron Swanson,That's called a conversation.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, there are no ficuses, okay?"
Ann Perkins,I wanted to ask Chris to be the father of my baby.
Ron Swanson,Good God.
Ron Swanson,And the metaphor you chose was planting ficuses in your front yard?
Ann Perkins,"I was gonna wait till he was single to ask him, but now he's flirting with Shauna again."
Ann Perkins,What do I do?
Ron Swanson,It's been nice talking to you.
Ann Perkins,What?
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just do impressions.
Leslie Knope,"""I'ma Borat."""
Leslie Knope,There's one.
Leslie Knope,But I need to do someone that no one has heard before.
Leslie Knope,"Like, I don't know, Neve Campbell?"
Leslie Knope,What does Neve Campbell sound like?
Donna Meagle,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"Someone, [bleep] tell me what Neve Campbell sounds like."
Donna Meagle,Just keep it short and get the hell out of there.
Joan Callamezzo,Thank you.
Joan Callamezzo,Our next guest has asked me to read this.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I forgot I did this."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, no"
Joan Callamezzo,"Strap on your adult diapers, everyone."
Joan Callamezzo,"""Because you're about to wet yourself from laughter."
Joan Callamezzo,Give it up for Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"""Whassup,"" Pawnee?"
Leslie Knope,Um Borat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's my time."
Leslie Knope,They're giving me the light.
Leslie Knope,"So, uh, I did great."
Extra,"Thank you, Leslie Knope."
Extra,You know what they say.
Extra,"Drama is hard, and sometimes comedy is not in our wheelhouse."
Ben Wyatt,"Tom, do you have to run that right now?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, Ben!"
Tom Haverford,These smoothies will just blend themselves!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Think I have our winner.
Ben Wyatt,It's called Rural Ambucare.
Ben Wyatt,They want to buy an ambulance for people who live far away from the hospital.
April Ludgate,Ambulances are dumb.
April Ludgate,When has an ambulance ever helped anyone?
April Ludgate,What about Andy's music thing?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is a great service that will help a lot of needy people."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's totally fine."
Andy Dwyer,I'm happy for them.
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Andy Dwyer,You know what I'm gonna do?
Andy Dwyer,"I'm gonna head out to, uh, the car."
Andy Dwyer,"It's a little hot in here, a little sweaty."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm terribly disappointed."
Tom Haverford,But I'm sure the doctors or giraffes or whatever you decided to help will be thrilled with the whatever you decided to whatever.
Tom Haverford,I'm outtie.
Tom Haverford,"Great job, team."
Ben Wyatt,What?
April Ludgate,"Ever since Andy failed the police exam, he's been really depressed."
April Ludgate,Picking out a dumb charity is the most excited he's been in weeks.
April Ludgate,You're so selfish.
Ben Wyatt,Selfish?
Ben Wyatt,I'm running a charity.
April Ludgate,"Oh, it's all about what you're doing, isn't it?"
April Ludgate,Classic Ben!
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, forgot the oysters."
Tom Haverford,Great work today.
Ann Perkins,Christopher.
Ann Perkins,"""Christoefur."""
Ann Perkins,It's like you have furry toes.
Chris Traeger,Hilarious.
Ann Perkins,I have a question for you.
Ann Perkins,It's something very important.
Ann Perkins,Which is What is your Spirit animal?
Chris Traeger,Jaguar.
Chris Traeger,Why do you ask?
Ann Perkins,Doing a survey.
Ann Perkins,"Well, survey completed."
Ann Perkins,So take her easy.
Perd Hapley,"Uh, you didn't ask me."
Perd Hapley,"But if you had, the answer I would have given is Doggie."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, Ann wants to ask you something right now."
Ron Swanson,"Go, Ann."
Ann Perkins,In front of Perd?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,No more delays.
Ron Swanson,Go.
Ann Perkins,I want to have a baby.
Ann Perkins,Will you be the sperm donor?
Perd Hapley,The story of this situation is it's extremely personal.
Ann Perkins,Think it over.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, permission to leave the corner."
Leslie Knope,Denied.
Jerry Gergich,"But, look, I did not lose your speech after all."
Jerry Gergich,I forgot.
Jerry Gergich,I put it in my shoe for safekeeping.
Jerry Gergich,"It's a little moist, but it is still here."
Leslie Knope,"Well, then how did Kim get the speech?"
Leslie Knope,Wait a minute.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun has been one step ahead of me for months.
Leslie Knope,They knew that Kernston's withdrew its sponsorship of the Commons before I even announced it.
Leslie Knope,They asked me about the sewage eruption in Ramsett Park right after Ron emailed me about it.
Leslie Knope,And Kim asked me if I liked the first season Army Wives just moments after Netflix did.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee Sun hacked my email.
Leslie Knope,I've been hacked!
Donna Meagle,"Okay, smashing your phone won't stop hacking."
Jerry Gergich,That's also my phone.
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, quiet!"
Leslie Knope,This is serious.
Leslie Knope,"Well, the police said they're gonna launch an investigation to see whether or not I was hacked."
Leslie Knope,"But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month."
Chris Traeger,There is nothing more disgusting than an invasion of privacy.
Chris Traeger,And I should know.
Chris Traeger,I've had many women steal my undershirts.
Leslie Knope,I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.
Leslie Knope,"So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever."
Leslie Knope,I need to know what they might use against me.
Ron Swanson,You can't hack into a typewriter.
Ron Swanson,That's all I have to say.
Leslie Knope,"Can it, Unabomber."
Leslie Knope,This is an emergency.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Andy Dwyer,You wanted to talk to me?
Andy Dwyer,Or probably not.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I don't even want to talk to me."
Ben Wyatt,"No, I wanted to talk to you."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"I just wanted to thank you so much for your help, Andy."
Ben Wyatt,Sorry we didn't wind up choosing the after school music program.
Andy Dwyer,I totally get it.
Andy Dwyer,"The music program would be effective, but the ambulance is gonna help people right now who are in trouble and will probably look good in the media."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's exactly right."
Extra,"Your morning tea, Mr. Wyatt."
Andy Dwyer,Imagine all the money you could save if you didn't have to pay for this expensive stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Am I right?
Andy Dwyer,"You could help, like, a zillion more charities."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's also exactly right."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I should have thought of that.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, let me tell you something else that's interesting, Ben."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Andy Dwyer,I farted five minutes ago.
Andy Dwyer,Didn't even smell it till just now.
Andy Dwyer,That's how tight my pants are.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyhow Later days, dudes."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, nothing too bad so far."
Donna Meagle,"There's a ""Top Ten Ben's butt 2012 slide show."""
Donna Meagle,You emailed it to Ben and Ann And The Huffington Post?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I'm not embarrassed by that."
Ron Swanson,Who is Todo Toadfoot?
Ron Swanson,"You wrote him an email about riding your dragons to Pelennor Fields and signed it ""Dimple Broadbelt of Buckland."""
Leslie Knope,"Yes, that's Ben and my fantasy Lord Of The Rings pen pal letters."
Leslie Knope,I am a little embarrassed by that.
Chris Traeger,"Here's one to me, and it just says ""Thanks."""
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great, I got a new email about the parking lot at the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,I keep getting emails all the time!
Leslie Knope,I have to do well at this press conference!
Leslie Knope,Donna!
Donna Meagle,"Listen, freaky."
Donna Meagle,Every single one of my boyfriends has tried to hack into my email.
Donna Meagle,I've got an idea Everybody out.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, I see you behind that attractive purse."
Chris Traeger,You haven't returned any of my calls.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's because, uh, I'm mortified."
Ann Perkins,I'm so sorry that I was so weird and blunt.
Chris Traeger, I am touched and honored that you would even consider me to be the father of your child.
Chris Traeger, And I'm glad that you came right out and said it.
Chris Traeger," I mean, if we're really considering this, then we have to start at a place of complete honesty."
Ann Perkins, You're right.
Ann Perkins, And I'll start now.
Ann Perkins, You are a great specimen.
Ann Perkins, That's a terrible choice of words.
Ann Perkins, If my baby turned out to be anything like you I'd be lucky.
Chris Traeger, Can I have just a little bit of time to think about it?
Ann Perkins,"Of course, yes."
Ann Perkins, Take as much time as you want.
Ann Perkins," Or just maybe, like, a couple days."
Ann Perkins, 'Cause I'm getting antsy.
Ann Perkins, And I'm ovulating on Thursday.
Ann Perkins," So, chop-chop."
Ann Perkins, But take your time.
Ann Perkins," Wear loose pants! I gotta tell you, Ron."
Ann Perkins, You were absolutely and totally right.
Ron Swanson, I know.
Ron Swanson, Stop talking and get out.
Ann Perkins, Yep.
Jessica Wicks, The redneck ambulance is a great choice.
Jessica Wicks, We can release a publicity shot of a bucktoothed hayseed taking medicine for the first time in his life.
Ben Wyatt, We can figure out the photo later.
Jessica Wicks," Oh, I forgot! It's Fondue Friday."
Jessica Wicks, Yay!
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, also, as President of the foundation, I'm making a few changes."
Ben Wyatt, I'm giving up this office.
Ben Wyatt, And no more visits from a masseuse or fancy lunches.
Ben Wyatt, It's way out of hand.
Jessica Wicks," Sweetie, all the money we spend on the foundation is tax deductible."
Ben Wyatt," I know, and it's a huge waste of money."
Ben Wyatt," I mean, there's plenty of cheap office space around."
Ben Wyatt, And I have an idea for how to use some of the money we'll save.
Jessica Wicks, Get yourself a matching nude portrait? I can call the painter.
Ben Wyatt,Please don't.
Leslie Knope," First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs."
Leslie Knope, I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Is it chocolate?
Leslie Knope,Even better.
Leslie Knope, It's dirt.
Leslie Knope," The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, ""Minimal acceptable standards."""
Leslie Knope,So not too shabby.
Kim Terlando," Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed construction will take 18 months, but a source tells me it will be much longer."
Leslie Knope, I would I would deny that report.
Kim Terlando, I've also learned that the EPA found midi-chlorians in the soil.
Kim Terlando," How serious is that, exactly?"
Leslie Knope,"It's very serious, Kim."
Leslie Knope," It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks."
Leslie Knope, I really thought you guys would gasp there.
Kim Terlando, That is a baseless accusation.
Leslie Knope, Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.
Leslie Knope," Which, side-note, was a terrible movie."
Leslie Knope," It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband."
Leslie Knope, But that is neither here nor there.
Donna Meagle," The point is I sent Councilwoman Knope the fake email about the EPA finding midi-chlorians, an hour ago As a trap."
Donna Meagle, Into which you have fallen.
Kim Terlando," Well I have never seen Star Wars, because I was too busy hooking up with guys."
Kim Terlando, Unlike you losers.
Donna Meagle," Uh, you wanna compare numbers, Terlando? Get to steppin'."
Leslie Knope," I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes."
Leslie Knope, So I spent the whole night writing new ones.
Leslie Knope," Lucky for you, let's get started."
Leslie Knope, I'm very excited to be here.
Leslie Knope, You know who else is excited to be here?
Leslie Knope,Neve Campbell.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope, What a great party of five.
Donna Meagle," All right, thank you, guys."
Ben Wyatt," The point is, I could use someone to help me at the foundation as a part-time assistant but also an idea man."
Andy Dwyer, Might I suggest Tom? He loves ideas.
Andy Dwyer, Also a man.
Ben Wyatt," What No, Andy, I've already chosen the person."
Ben Wyatt, And it is not Tom 
Andy Dwyer,Then who is it?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, he is, uh, sitting right here in this courtyard."
Andy Dwyer, That guy? Do you even know him?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, Andy, it's you."
Ben Wyatt, I think you may have a knack for charitable giving.
Ben Wyatt, Will you come work for me? Uh-oh.
Ben Wyatt, What's happening? Oh.

Tom Haverford,"RentASwag shareholders: As you can see, your store is hoppin'."
Tom Haverford,These kids are renting my old clothes like they're going out of style.
Tom Haverford,Which they never will.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's a lot of foot traffic, Tommy."
Donna Meagle,I like it.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, ""dayyayyam,"" it is kind of a sausage party in here."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"For the record, would hit it, would hit, would hit."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hard pass.
Ron Swanson,"Tom, who is this person?"
Tom Haverford,"This is MonaLisa Saperstein, my new sales associate."
Ben Wyatt,MonaLisa Saperstein?
Ben Wyatt,Does that mean
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, yeah she's my sister."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"My twin sister, from the same mister."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Thank you so much for hiring MonaLisa.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It means so much to me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Even though, honestly, she's  The wooorst."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She is the worst person in the world.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Huge skank.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Terrible.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,But thank you.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It means a lot.
Tom Haverford,Of course.
Tom Haverford,Got to keep it in the family.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but does it have to be this family?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Actually, that reminds me, Bababa boss man I need to leave early today because my shrink got me and him tickets to a Pitbull concert."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,And I already committed to that.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"And so if you say that I can't go, it's like you're taking something away from me."
Tom Haverford,"Um, store's really busy."
Tom Haverford,I kinda need you to stay.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mmhmm.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I totally hear you.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Um, I also don't like what you're saying."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"So if you say no, I will start a fire in the bathroom."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I guess you can go."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yeah, I know I can."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What did I tell you, huh?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The woooorst.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She's the worst in the world.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,JeanRalphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,How are you?
Dennis Lerpiss,Hello.
Dennis Lerpiss,Welcome to Pawnee Videodome.
Dennis Lerpiss,Today we'll be screening Stanley Kubrick's 1957 classic Paths Of Glory.
Dennis Lerpiss,It's about three men who refuse to go on a suicide mission and are executed for cowardice.
Leslie Knope,"Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie."
Leslie Knope,One that's a little bit more upbeat.
Leslie Knope,Like Finding Nemo or
Dennis Lerpiss,"I could do, uh, Shoah."
Leslie Knope,"Okay,Paths Of Glory it is."
Leslie Knope,This is the Pawnee Videodome.
Leslie Knope,And we are here because I started a program to help local business.
Leslie Knope,This is a Pawnee institution.
Leslie Knope,"This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd."
Perd Hapley,"It's a heartwarming story, but it's just not believable."
Perd Hapley,Which is why I give E.T. 1 and a 1/2 stars.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, it's over."
Leslie Knope,"Get up, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,What's everybody where are we?
Dennis Lerpiss,The reason I love that film is that it's really depressing.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Speaking of which, sadly, next month, Pawnee Videodome will be closing its doors."
Dennis Lerpiss,Forever.
Leslie Knope,No!
Dennis Lerpiss,"For those of you that have attended our screenings, I want to thank you for your patronage, though I wish you would have rented more movies."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business."
Leslie Knope,"Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"Sir, will you rent something?"
Morris,Why would I do that?
Morris,All movies are online for free.
Morris,I'm watching Iron Man 2 on my phone right now.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you're not helping."
Leslie Knope,"I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo."
Dennis Lerpiss,"Ooh, we don't carry cartoons."
Dennis Lerpiss,"But if you want a film about the ocean, we have a documentary about the brutality of Japan's whaling industry."
Dennis Lerpiss,It's called Tears Of My Blowhole.
Dennis Lerpiss,And it's it's nauseating.
Leslie Knope,I'll just buy some red vines.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, we only have Japanese slime candy and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, seriously, where are we?"
Chris Traeger,All these kids have fathers and mothers who have birthed them and are guiding them through life.
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, that's how it works."
Ben Wyatt,How are you feeling?
Ben Wyatt,Did you make your dadcision yet?
Chris Traeger,I am 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I'm going to do.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins asked me if I would like to donate sperm, so she can have a baby."
Chris Traeger,It's a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyzing fear of negatively affecting any living thing.
Tom Haverford,There's 60 dollars missing from the register.
Tom Haverford,I think MonaLisa's stealing from me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Yeah, it is absolutely MonaLisa."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She's a total klepto.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And nympho and pyro all those things.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as your CFO, I recommend getting rid of her immediately."
Tom Haverford,I'm throwing a huge cocktail party tomorrow for all my best clients.
Tom Haverford,I don't have time to find someone new.
Tom Haverford,This sucks.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when I was in high school, we had to spend a week carrying around a sack of flour, pretending it was a kid."
Ben Wyatt,"Why don't you make Tom your sack of flour, see how it feels to parent him a little?"
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that is literally the greatest idea in human history."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I heard ""sack of flour"" and ""high school."""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Are you dingdongs making fake drugs for sophomores?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because if true, this guy wants in."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, just have Mr. Traeger call me when he gets back in."
Ann Perkins,"Actually, you know what?"
Ann Perkins,Don't tell him that I called.
Ann Perkins,"Just when he gets there, can you text me and tell me he's back?"
Ann Perkins,You know what?
Ann Perkins,"Let's just pretend this didn't happen, okay?"
Ann Perkins,This is Jerry Gergich calling.
Ann Perkins,Bye.
April Ludgate,I have to tell you a secret.
April Ludgate,"But if you tell anyone, I will kill you slowly with a giant syringe."
Ann Perkins,"Good morning, April."
Ann Perkins,What's your secret?
April Ludgate,I'm thinking about applying to veterinary school in Bloomington.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, April, that's great!"
Ann Perkins,Whoa!
Ann Perkins,Where'd you get that?
April Ludgate,The Internet.
April Ludgate,So I really need a letter of recommendation.
April Ludgate,"And since you work in a hospital,  as a janitor"
Ann Perkins,Nurse.
April Ludgate,I was wondering if maybe you would write one for me?
Ann Perkins,Really?
Ann Perkins,"Generally, between us, April always has the upper hand."
Ann Perkins,And that hand is usually giving me the finger or pouring honey in my purse.
Ann Perkins,But now I have the upper hand.
Ann Perkins,And I'm going to use it to crush her Into being nice to me.
Ann Perkins,I would be happy to write you that letter.
Ann Perkins,I actually know the guy who runs the veterinary program over there.
April Ludgate,Because you hooked up with him?
Ann Perkins,I don't hook up with everyone I know.
Ann Perkins,"Although, yes, we did hook up."
Ann Perkins,"But before I write you that letter, you have to spend the next week with me and do everything I say."
April Ludgate,So I have to be your slave or something?
Ann Perkins,"No, you have to be my friend."
April Ludgate,"No, that is so much worse."
Ann Perkins,Don't do that.
Leslie Knope,I think I have a plan of how to save your store.
Leslie Knope,"If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat."
Ron Swanson,That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market."
Leslie Knope,But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.
Leslie Knope,That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.
Leslie Knope,But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.
Leslie Knope,Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Ron Swanson,This man is a failure.
Ron Swanson,He is not up to snuff.
Ron Swanson,"His business is failing, and you're bailing it out."
Ron Swanson,"This is a bailout, and I don't like it."
Ron Swanson,And there are some pretty intellectual conversations down at Barrett's Hardware.
Leslie Knope,"You may get a little heat for this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,So use your money wisely.
Leslie Knope,Get popular films that people wanna see.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Like, uh, get the Tarkovsky movies with the subtitles."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Like Pixar.
Leslie Knope,Reese Witherspoon.
Leslie Knope,"I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay."
Dennis Lerpiss,What?
Dennis Lerpiss,"No, no."
Dennis Lerpiss,No.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, I have something I need to talk to you about."
Tom Haverford,Do we need to sit like this?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Chris Traeger,MonaLisa's taking advantage of you.
Chris Traeger,And I'm sure that it's not easy when it's the sister of a dear friend.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no, it's not that."
Tom Haverford,She scares the crap out of me.
Tom Haverford,I once saw her punch a police horse in the face.
Chris Traeger,"Speak directly to her and tell her, ""I will not be disrespected."""
Chris Traeger,You're Tom Haverford.
Chris Traeger,"You're a smart, successful young man with an adorable, little belly."
Chris Traeger,Stand up for yourself.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'll talk to her before the party."
Tom Haverford,"And if she murders me, tell JeanRalphio to clear my browser history."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks for the advice, man."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger,Son.
Tom Haverford,What's that?
Chris Traeger,Nothing.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.
Andy Dwyer,And my second Bruce Lee movie.
Andy Dwyer,"And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest."
Andy Dwyer,"And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded."
Andy Dwyer,And hornets came out.
Leslie Knope,Andy
Andy Dwyer,"The point is, obviously, you do not throw rocks at a hornet's nest."
Leslie Knope,"And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons."
Leslie Knope,Any other comments here before we Ron?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing at a city council meeting?
Leslie Knope,Are you lost?
Leslie Knope,Are you hurt?
Ron Swanson,"No, I am here to express an opinion."
Ron Swanson,This action by Councilwoman Knope is nothing more than a thinly veiled government bailout.
Ron Swanson,"And I, for one, refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape."
Ron Swanson,Allow me to elaborate.
Ron Swanson,The government should not prop up a failed business.
Ron Swanson,That would be like giving food to a mortally wounded animal instead of slitting its throat and properly utilizing its meat and pelt.
Leslie Knope,Please stop talking about wounded meat.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.
Leslie Knope,A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.
Ron Swanson,You rented Rashomon?
Ron Swanson,What was your favorite part of that?
Leslie Knope,"I haven't rented it, actually, yet."
Leslie Knope,But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.
Morris,"Uh, you can just watch it online, for free, whenever you want."
Leslie Knope,Bailiff!
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mr. Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one."
Leslie Knope,"Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Extra,How much to rent this jacket?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Oh.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Curly Sue, that jacket is so ugly."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,You should just take it.
Tom Haverford,"It's 15 for the day, 40 for the week. Thank you."
Tom Haverford,We appreciate your business.
Tom Haverford,MonaLisa!
Tom Haverford,Did you order the champagne for the client party tonight?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Did I order the what for the what what what, what?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What are you even talking about right now?
Tom Haverford,"Okay, we need to discuss your work habits."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, sure, but after I take a quick nap because ecstasy takes  forever to leave my system"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,We're doing this now.
Tom Haverford,You need to start putting in more of an effort and start respecting my authority around here!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Or else what?
Tom Haverford,Or else I'll fire you.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What did you just say?
Tom Haverford,"I said, if you don't shape up, I'll fire you."
Tom Haverford,Do you understand?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"You are so freaking sexy right now, I could crap my pants."
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,What are you doing?
Ann Perkins,"I guess it would have to be Channing Tatum's body, Ryan Gosling's face, and Michael Fassbender's sense of humor."
Ann Perkins,What about you?
Ann Perkins,Build your perfect guy.
April Ludgate,"Um Yao Ming's torso, Napoleon's brain, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame's hunchback."
April Ludgate,Do you like my nails?
Ann Perkins,"Even though she hides it underneath layers of sarcasm, resentment, and grumpiness, I know, deep down somewhere, April likes me."
Ann Perkins,I'm kind of just fracking for friendship.
Extra,"Gene Strackwell, owner of Strackwell Hardware."
Extra,Is there a form I need to fill out for the bailout?
Leslie Knope,We're not bailing anyone out.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.
Extra,We've been around way longer than that stupid art house movie bullcrap.
Extra,And people need places to buy tools.
Morris,"Uh, you can just buy tools online."
Leslie Knope,"Bailiff, why is he back in here?"
Leslie Knope,How did you get back in here?
Morris,I'll see myself out.
Morris,Don't worry about it.
Joe From Sewage,I heard you were giving out free money.
Joe From Sewage,"I need $3,000."
Joe From Sewage,Minimum.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan."
Joe From Sewage,"What would you do if one of your citizens was about to come into some serious physical harm Unless he got 3,000 dollars?"
Leslie Knope,I'd call the police.
Joe From Sewage,You cannot call the police.
Extra,"Wilson Gromling of the ""Liberty or Die"" party."
Extra,These government handouts are deplorable.
Extra,You're just handing out blank checks.
Extra,I was on food stamps.
Extra,I was on Welfare.
Extra,And nobody ever helped me.
Leslie Knope,This is not a blank check.
Leslie Knope,I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.
Leslie Knope,"In a few days, Dennis will reopen."
Leslie Knope,"The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved."
Councilman Howser,Are there any other comments?
Extra,Yes.
Extra,"The Pawnee chapter of the ""Liberty or Die"" party has hit some hard times."
Extra,We were wondering if maybe the town could loan us some money.
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Chris Traeger,"Tom, how did it go with MonaLisa?"
Tom Haverford,"I told her she needed to change her attitude, or I was gonna have to fire her."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that is very responsible and mature."
Ben Wyatt,She took it well?
Tom Haverford,Um yeah.
Tom Haverford,"For some reason, she got super turned on."
Tom Haverford,We started making out.
Tom Haverford,Hard.
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know, we're back at my place, having sex."
Tom Haverford,We're together now.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, bitch, I need to borrow some money to do something that is none of your damn beeswax, namely, I need to wax my bee."
Tom Haverford,Here you go.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'd still hit it.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm coolin' on you.
Tom Haverford,See?
Tom Haverford,Perfect!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you have to choose one."
April Ludgate,I can't think.
April Ludgate,These braids you did are making my brain hurt.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Miranda.
Ann Perkins,"No, I think you're a Charlotte."
Ann Perkins,You're like a scary Charlotte.
Chris Traeger,Hey.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you."
Ann Perkins,What's what's up?
Chris Traeger,Nothin'.
April Ludgate,This is weird.
Ann Perkins,"No, it's not."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it is."
April Ludgate,Why is it weird?
Ann Perkins,It's not weird.
Ann Perkins,Do you want to talk in private?
April Ludgate,"No, anything you can say to Ann, you can say to me because we're best friends this week."
Chris Traeger,Can we talk later?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
April Ludgate,Why don't you talk now?
Ann Perkins,"No, talk to you later."
April Ludgate,"Chris, we can talk now."
April Ludgate,"What's going on, best friend?"
Ann Perkins,"Nothing, never mind."
April Ludgate,Tell me.
Ann Perkins,Nothing's happening.
Ann Perkins,Back to forced friendship.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, let's go put on our pj's and make White Russians."
Ann Perkins,So fun.
Ron Swanson,Councilwoman.
Ron Swanson,"I just came down to see the effects of your government intervention, and I've got to hand it to you You really turned this place around."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is amazing, Dennis."
Dennis Lerpiss,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You did it!
Leslie Knope,We did it!
Leslie Knope,I did it.
Leslie Knope,This is me.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, it was."
Dennis Lerpiss,I took your advice.
Dennis Lerpiss,"Got rid of all those dusty, old foreign films and used the money for the part of our business that's always done pretty well for us."
Dennis Lerpiss,"Give the people what they want, right?"
Leslie Knope,This isn't what people want.
Andy Dwyer,It's definitely what that guy wants.
Herman,I like this store now.
Leslie Knope,Do you realize what you have done?
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee government now effectively owns a porn shop.
Leslie Knope,You have made us porn peddlers!
Brandi Maxxxx,"Hello everyone, I'm Brandi Maxxxx."
Brandi Maxxxx,Let's give a big round of applause to Councilwoman Knope for keeping this store in business!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Everyone stop applauding.
Leslie Knope,"For the record, I was just trying to help a place that had tremendous cultural value."
Brandi Maxxxx,"Leslie, you've always been a huge supporter of my work."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, I haven't."
Brandi Maxxxx,So I'm thrilled to tell you that I'm playing Leslie Knope in the porn version of the story of this government bailout!
Leslie Knope,Please don't do that.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Oh, we already filmed it."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Brandi Maxxxx,The porn industry in town was really faltering.
Brandi Maxxxx,But now we're back.
Brandi Maxxxx,You're our hero!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Are you ready?
April Ludgate,For you to tell me what's going on with Chris?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,To sing.
Ann Perkins,"If you're lost, you can look   and you will find me  time after time go."
April Ludgate,"No, tell me about Chris."
Ann Perkins,"If you fall, I will catch you   I'll be waitin'"
April Ludgate,"Tell me about Chris, or I'm leaving, and I don't care about the letter."
Ann Perkins,"I wanna have a baby, and I asked Chris to donate his sperm."
Ann Perkins,"And he's taking a really long time to make up his mind, and it's really freaking me out."
Ann Perkins,"And I can't stop thinking about it, and I'm obsessing about it, and I want to think about anything else but that, but it's making me crazy."
April Ludgate,Secrets stolen  from deep inside.
Ann Perkins,You know this song already?
April Ludgate,Of course I do.
April Ludgate,Everyone knows this song.
April Ludgate,It's amazing.
April Ludgate,The drum beats out of time
Ann Perkins," if you're lost, you can look   and you will find me  time after time  if you fall, I will catch you  time after time  time after time  time after time."
April Ludgate," if you're lost, you can look   and you will find me  time after time  if you fall, I will catch you  time after time  time after time  time after time."
Donna Meagle,"oh, I'll be waiting"
April Ludgate,This never happened.
Chris Traeger,I made everything worse.
Chris Traeger,"If Tom were a bag of flour, that flour would never grow up to be a happy, welladjusted loaf of bread."
Chris Traeger,"Much less a bran muffin, which is the highest honor that flour can achieve."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so you're really gonna say no to Ann?"
Chris Traeger,"I care about Ann very deeply, but I just don't know if I'm cut out to be a dad."
Jerry Gergich,"You know, Chris, every parent makes mistakes."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, lord knows I've made plenty."
Jerry Gergich,But it's the small victories that keep you going.
Jerry Gergich,"When you see your little one take her first step oror graduate college, oh, my God, it just makes it all worth it."
Jerry Gergich,"And another thing is if If, like If I You know, and then your kid's because you're like vrrrr I don't know."
Jerry Gergich,"And everyone's like, ""Oh."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I'm sorry, guys."
Jerry Gergich,I no one ever lets me talk this long.
Jerry Gergich,I just got lost.
Jerry Gergich,It was a beautiful point.
Chris Traeger,"And very well said, right up until that moment that you started babbling incoherently."
Ron Swanson,And I'll have the number eight.
Extra,That's a party platter.
Extra,It serves 12 people.
Ron Swanson,"I know what I'm about, son."
Leslie Knope,"Go ahead, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Let me have it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait, I'll do it for you."
Leslie Knope,"I told you so, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,This is what happens when the government interferes with business.
Leslie Knope,"Government is bad, business is good."
Leslie Knope,Free market.
Ron Swanson,"Capitalism is the only way, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,It moves our country forward.
Ron Swanson,It's what makes America great.
Ron Swanson,And England okay and France terrible.
Leslie Knope,I like capitalism.
Leslie Knope,I love competition.
Leslie Knope,I'm more competitive than you.
Ron Swanson,I don't think so.
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Ron Swanson,Settle down.
Leslie Knope,"No, settle up."
Leslie Knope," 'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won."
Leslie Knope," Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money."
Ron Swanson, There is not.
Ron Swanson, The free market is a jungle.
Ron Swanson, It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.
Ron Swanson," When a business fails, it dies, and a new, better one takes its place."
Ron Swanson, Just let business be business and government be government.
Extra, Here you go.
Extra, And one number eight.
Ron Swanson," All right, party time."
Leslie Knope," I would suggest sticking around and watching him eat it 'cause it only takes four minutes, and it's pretty amazing."
Ron Swanson, These will not be necessary.
Ann Perkins," Here is your letter of recommendation, so you're off the hook."
Ann Perkins, No need to pretend to be my friend anymore.
April Ludgate, Thank God.
Ann Perkins," I can't tell if you actually hate me or if this is just how you are, but I had fun hanging out with you."
Ann Perkins," So I don't care what you say, you're my friend."
Ann Perkins," And I hope you get into veterinary school because I like you, so there."
April Ludgate, I got you something too.
Ann Perkins, A baby-naming book.
April Ludgate, I hope it works out with Chris.
April Ludgate," And if it doesn't, I hope it works out with someone."
Ann Perkins, We're gonna hug now.
April Ludgate,No.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
April Ludgate, Ow! You're hurting me!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Mm! Lot of hot ""D"" in here tonight."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein," Ooh, look at that chunky hunky."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein, Go over there and talk to him and find out what his deal is.
Tom Haverford," No, I'm not gonna talk to some other guy."
Tom Haverford," When we're together, you can't check out other guys."
Tom Haverford, That's the deal.
Tom Haverford," Or else it's over between us, you understand?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mm! Tommy laying down the law.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein, A little feisty.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein," I like that, okay? I'ma go get a soda."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein, Do you want to have sex somewhere after I do that?
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,All right.
Chris Traeger, Well.
Chris Traeger, Looks like things with Mona-Lisa are Continuing.
Tom Haverford, Yeah.
Tom Haverford, I think I'm gradually transforming her from truly terrible to only kinda terrible.
Tom Haverford," It's the small victories, you know?"
Chris Traeger,Indeed.
Chris Traeger, The small victories.
Tom Haverford," I know she's kind of a monster, but whatever."
Tom Haverford, I'm young.
Tom Haverford, She's sexy.
Tom Haverford, I'm just gonna see where this roller coaster goes.
Chris Traeger, Fair enough.
Chris Traeger, Is there anything else you need help with? Have you learned how to ride a bike yet?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford, I'm 28 years old.
Chris Traeger," I'm proud of you, bud."
Tom Haverford, Thanks!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Ann Perkins," Is that a happy ""Ann Perkins,"" or is that a bad-news ""Ann Perkins""?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, happy."
Chris Traeger, Obviously.
Chris Traeger, The bad news one sounds like this.
Chris Traeger," ""Ann Perkins."""
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Chris Traeger," Well, I've thought about it."
Chris Traeger, And I'm in.
Chris Traeger, I want to be a parent.
Chris Traeger," I want to raise a child, with all the ups and downs and challenges that comes with it."
Ann Perkins," Chris, this is so great."
Ann Perkins,I'm so happy.
Chris Traeger,Me too.
Chris Traeger," Well, I guess your uter-you and my uter-me are now our uter-us."
Ann Perkins, Don't make me change my mind.
Leslie Knope," Although we are all sad and deeply grossed out that the Pawnee Videodome is turning into a porno palace, I am happy to announce that the Pawnee government will be hosting a weekly movie night here at the Community Center."
Leslie Knope, There will be free screenings followed by a discussion led by local film buff Dennis Lerpiss.
Leslie Knope, Tonight's film is The Sound Of Music.
Leslie Knope, And action.
Brandi Maxxxx," I'm glad you're here, Dong Swanson."
Brandi Maxxxx, The local video store's about to go under.
Brandi Maxxxx, We have to save it.
Leslie Knope," Oh, this is the wrong movie."
Leslie Knope," We shut this down, please."
Leslie Knope,Shut it down.
Extra,"Sorry, Leslie."
Extra," I'm a strict libertarian, and I don't believe in bailouts."
Leslie Knope, This is not how it happened.

Extra,I'm looking for Ronald Ulysses Swanson?
Ron Swanson,He stepped out.
Ron Swanson,Can I take a message?
Extra,Sure.
Extra,Tell him he just won a free dinner from St. Elmo's steak house.
Ron Swanson,I'm Ron Swanson!
Extra,You've been served.
Extra,Have a nice day.
Ron Swanson,I don't like you.
Ron Swanson,But I respect the effort.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man, subpoena?"
Tom Haverford,"Which exwife is it, Tammy one or Tammy two?"
Ron Swanson,Neither.
Ron Swanson,Apparently councilman Jeremy Jamm is not pleased that I punched him in the face on the night of Leslie's wedding.
Ron Swanson,He's suing me.
Ron Swanson,"13,000 for orthodontic surgery, 6,000 for enamel repair, and 46 million for psychological damages."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, that seems about accurate."
April Ludgate,That guy is the worst.
April Ludgate,We should sue Jamm's parents for spawning a human turdburger.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, hey, let me be your lawyer."
Andy Dwyer,"I'll object to everything anyone says, trial will go on forever, you don't have to pay."
Andy Dwyer,Problem solved.
Ron Swanson,"That's a kind offer, Andrew, but I won't be hiring an attorney."
Ron Swanson,"I'll represent myself, as I do in all legal matters and livestock auctions."
April Ludgate,I wish we had 46 million dollars.
April Ludgate,We could buy my parents' house and evict them.
Tom Haverford,Surprised he's taking it this well.
Ron Swanson,Aghh!
Ron Swanson,"April, could you call maintenance please?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, move a little bit to your left and then turn to the side."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, and freeze."
Leslie Knope,"That is the exact spot where an 18 year old Ben Wyatt was inaugurated as mayor of Partridge, Minnesota."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you very much."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, congratulations to you."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I have chills.
Ben Wyatt,Can't believe they're finally giving me the key to the city.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it took so long.
Leslie Knope,"They gave the key to every other mayor in the town's history, and I guarantee that none of them had as cute a butt as you do."
Ben Wyatt,And none of them caused the city's unemployment rate to hit 30%.
Leslie Knope,You're so sexy when you talk about percentages.
Leslie Knope,"When Ben was mayor, he sunk all of the town's money into a winter sports complex called ""Ice Town,"" and they went bankrupt."
Leslie Knope,"Now they've invited him back as a gesture of goodwill, and he'll finally get some closure on this miserable chapter in his life."
Leslie Knope,"Yay, Ben!"
Leslie Knope,Town hero!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, if it isn't the defendant, Ron Swansuck."
Tom Haverford,"Why are you doing this, Jamm?"
Tom Haverford,This lawsuit is Chronicles of Riddickulous.
Jeremy Jamm,I'll tell you why.
Jeremy Jamm,It's 'cause I'm sick of this whole Parks and Rec gang.
Jeremy Jamm,That's why.
Jeremy Jamm,This munch throws me into a swimming pool.
Jeremy Jamm,"The nurse still won't have sex with me, and she's not even queer."
Jeremy Jamm,Now Swansuck punches me in the mouth.
Jeremy Jamm,"It's what we in the Jamm family call ""Payback time."""
Tom Haverford,Everyone calls it that.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, because I invented it."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you're not gonna win $50 million, you freak."
Jeremy Jamm,"Maybe not, but I'm not not going to win nothing."
Jeremy Jamm,Paul.
April Ludgate,That guy is a joke.
April Ludgate,This lawsuit is definitely getting thrown out.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know, those are JeanRalphio's lawyers."
Tom Haverford,"They once got him 60,000 dollars 'cause he got too scared at a haunted house."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, are you done?"
Chris Traeger,Are we done?
Chris Traeger,Did we win?
Ann Perkins,You can't win this.
Ann Perkins,You can win at anything.
Chris Traeger,Last year I won an organic gardening contest.
Donna Meagle,Who were you competing against?
Chris Traeger,My own taste buds.
Ann Perkins,"I wanna have a baby, and Chris has agreed to be the father."
Ann Perkins,My fertility counselor showed me this online quiz that determines whether we'd be compatible parents.
Ann Perkins,"If this were the '80s, all we'd have to do is, like, not drop an egg for a whole day."
Ann Perkins,Stupid Internet.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, our official coparenting score is 58% compatibility. Not amazing."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I think it's fantastic."
Chris Traeger,I think it's literally the best score we could have hoped for.
Ann Perkins,Not sure that that's true.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, snap!"
Donna Meagle,I just filled it out for fun.
Donna Meagle,Chris and I are 81% compatible.
Donna Meagle,"You wanna make a baby, traeger?"
Donna Meagle,"Your hair, my everything else."
Donna Meagle,That kid would be unstoppable.
Jerry Gergich,"Guys, I couldn't resist."
Jerry Gergich,I did it too.
Jerry Gergich,Ann and I got 84%.
Ann Perkins,"Well, this sucks."
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we did not win."
Leslie Knope,"So was, like, Ben a bossy older brother?"
Leslie Knope,Did he make you watch star war movies?
Stephanie Wyatt,Make me?
Stephanie Wyatt,I loved those movies just as much as he did.
Leslie Knope,That's so cute.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Oh, you do a lot of hugging."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, get used to it."
Leslie Knope,We're sisters now.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Benji, I'm really glad you came back for this."
Stephanie Wyatt,A lot of jerks around here didn't think you'd show up.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I wasn't sure, but Leslie gave me the extra push, and I figured it'd be nice to put the ice town thing behind me once and for all."
Leslie Knope,"Now that you're both here, let's get started."
Leslie Knope,Just have a few questions.
Stephanie Wyatt,You have a binder?
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,"Who were Ben's high school girlfriends, and what base do you think he got to?"
Ben Wyatt,Um  What's that?
Extra,And what exactly did you witness?
Andy Dwyer,"Defendant, alias Ron Swanson, alias my boss, used appropriate force to prevent further damage to the wedding of Leslie Knope, alias my other boss."
Extra,You sound as if you have a special interest in law enforcement.
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, sir."
Andy Dwyer,"In fact, at the time, I was trying to become a police officer but was deemed unfit for the force."
Extra,And what happened?
Andy Dwyer,Don't know.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I pooched the brain exam."
Andy Dwyer,"Just to be safe, I wouldn't take anything I say too seriously."
Andy Dwyer,"Next witness, your honor."
Extra,"Ms. Ludgate, have you ever heard Mr. Swanson threaten to hurt councilman Jamm?"
April Ludgate,Ronny?
April Ludgate,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,I've never heard him threaten to hurt anyone or anything.
April Ludgate,"The guy's, like, a vegetarian."
April Ludgate,"Look at him, he's like a big, old, soft teddy bear."
April Ludgate,"His nickname around the office is ""SoftyPants McHuggable."""
Extra,Did you ever hear Mr. Swanson say he intended to injure councilman Jamm before the day of the wedding?
Tom Haverford,"The answer is a flat ""no."""
Tom Haverford,Ron doesn't really pay much attention to other people.
Tom Haverford,I doubt he even knew you existed.
Tom Haverford,"Also, may I say for the record, that is a dope pocket square."
Tom Haverford,Can I see that bad boy?
Ron Swanson,Tom and April were excellent witnesses in my defense.
Ron Swanson,"Unfortunately, every single word out of their mouths was a lie."
Ron Swanson,There's only one thing I hate more than lying.
Ron Swanson,Skim milk.
Ron Swanson,Which is water that's lying about being milk.
Ben Wyatt,"Despite everything that happened 20 years ago, this will always be my hometown."
Ben Wyatt,Are you crying again?
Leslie Knope,"It's just every time you say that speech, I think about where you've been and where you're going and our future children and America and just our history as a nation."
Stephanie Wyatt,"Wow, I didn't think about all that, but I thought it was good."
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, Steph."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, I'm feeling sweaty."
Ben Wyatt,"Do I look sweat I feel oh, I need to use the bathroom one more time."
Stephanie Wyatt,"That's, like, five times in an hour."
Leslie Knope,"Well, somebody's nervous about the ceremony."
Stephanie Wyatt,I don't blame him.
Stephanie Wyatt,He didn't exactly leave Partridge as the most popular guy in town.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm giving birth.
Ben Wyatt,Is that possible?
Ben Wyatt,"No, right?"
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Stephanie Wyatt,I'll call an ambulance.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Ben Wyatt,It's twins!
Ben Wyatt,I'm having twins!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Kidney stone?
Extra,Big sucker too.
Extra,We're gonna have to keep him here until it passes.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie and Dr. Clipperton Wow, man, I'm so glad you guys are meeting."
Ben Wyatt,It's like worlds collide.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I love it."
Ben Wyatt,I want candy.
Ben Wyatt,What is he on?
Extra,Morphine.
Extra,It's good stuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, come here."
Ben Wyatt,Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?
Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.
Ben Wyatt,You're like a flower.
Ben Wyatt,"Or, no, like a snugbug or like a snuggerdoodle or something like that."
Ben Wyatt,"We should just go for it, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,Life.
Leslie Knope,We have a ceremony we need to be at in two hours.
Leslie Knope,Is there anything that we can do?
Extra,"Sorry, Ice Town, you're not going anywhere for at least a day."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I'll call mayor Stice, and we'll reschedule the ceremony."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this town expects me to wuss out."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm making that speech, and I'm simply gonna explain to the crowd that love is everywhere and they have to surrender to the flow of the universe, you know?"
Ben Wyatt,"Price Is Right is on, I think."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you remember staying home sick from school watching the price is right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Chris Traeger,"Look, I know that this is just a silly quiz, but it is so discouraging to do so poorly."
Ann Perkins,"Well, look, this is not the only way to see if we would be good parents."
Ann Perkins,"I know it's a little lame, but I bought a dozen eggs at the grocery store, and I thought we could do that thing where we pretend the egg is a kid for a day."
Chris Traeger,That's a great idea!
Ann Perkins,I don't see them.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,I left them at the grocery store.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,"I bought 12 babies, and then I immediately abandoned them at a Kroger's."
Chris Traeger,"Look, we can use anything as a baby."
Chris Traeger,"I mean, we could use this mug."
Tom Haverford,I don't understand.
Tom Haverford,I was great.
Tom Haverford,"I was like Mark Z in The Social ""N."""
Tom Haverford,My testimony was amazing for your case.
Ron Swanson,But it wasn't the truth.
Ron Swanson,And neither was yours.
Ron Swanson,You even called me a vegetarian.
Ron Swanson,What if that testimony leaks?
Ron Swanson,How will people ever respect me?
April Ludgate,"Ugh, whatever."
April Ludgate,The truth is stupid.
April Ludgate,I only tell the truth when it makes me sound like I'm lying.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, lying is all I know."
Tom Haverford,"It's how I was able to scrape by on the streets of Bombay and make it on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and get reunited with the love of my life, Latika."
Ron Swanson,You could both take a lesson from Andrew.
Ron Swanson,"He told the truth about everything he was asked, even when it was humiliating for him."
Andy Dwyer,That's right.
Andy Dwyer,I love telling the truth.
Andy Dwyer,"Case in point, sometimes when I blow my nose, I get a boner."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know why.
Andy Dwyer,It just happens.
Andy Dwyer,Truth bomb.
Ron Swanson,"I'm gonna call you both back in that room, and you'll recant your testimony."
April Ludgate,No!
Ron Swanson,You committed perjury.
Ron Swanson,"But more importantly, you've dishonored yourselves."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, brother."
Andy Dwyer,They are so young.
Andy Dwyer,So much to learn.
Ron Swanson,What are you talking about?
Andy Dwyer,"I know, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Wisdom.
Mayor Stice,Sick?
Mayor Stice,Do you really expect me to believe that?
Mayor Stice,"What has he got, acute wimping out?"
Stephanie Wyatt,"No, he has kidney stones."
Stephanie Wyatt,We have proof.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I took a video of him at the hospital an hour ago."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like I never gave miles Davis proper shrift.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, I just didn't get into it."
Leslie Knope,But the good news is I'm here to accept the key on his behalf.
Mayor Stice,"Boy, it's just a real shame it had to happen today of all days."
Mayor Stice,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,Everything okay?
Leslie Knope,You want me to come back to the hospital?
Ben Wyatt,"Pfft, nah."
Ben Wyatt,I'm goodie goodie.
Ben Wyatt,"You just do your thing, baby smurf."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wish you were here."
Leslie Knope,It seems pretty fun and festive.
Leslie Knope,Town mascot is here.
Ben Wyatt,Fred the Sled?
Ben Wyatt,They only bring him out for special occasions.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe they're doing all this for me.
Ben Wyatt,The universe is love.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, stay away from sharp things."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, well, well, heard you want to recant your earlier statements."
Tom Haverford,"Yes, I misremembered some things."
Tom Haverford,I did in fact hear Ron Swanson say he intended to injure Jeremy Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Boom, knew it."
Jeremy Jamm,"Tell us about it, please."
Tom Haverford,Which time?
Extra,"Well, how many were there?"
Tom Haverford,Well
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, we did a trade."
Jeremy Jamm,"I gave his wife new enamels, he gave my wife new yabbos."
Ron Swanson,Who's that gentleman?
Tom Haverford,"Jeremy Jamm, city councilman."
Tom Haverford,You don't know him?
Ron Swanson,Never met him.
Ron Swanson,He looks like he could use a swift punch in the face though.
Jeremy Jamm,Yes!
Tom Haverford,"And then before he can say anything, I just run over, shove him into the pool."
Ron Swanson,Bully for you.
Ron Swanson,"If it were me, I would have just punched him in the face."
Tom Haverford,"What's up, Ron?"
Ron Swanson,Just daydreaming about punching Jamm in the face.
Tom Haverford,And there were a few other times too.
Ron Swanson,"We get the picture, son."
Jeremy Jamm,Hold on.
Jeremy Jamm,"We need your full, truthful testimony on record."
Jeremy Jamm,"Keep going, Tom."
Mayor Stice,"But now, 20 years later, the city has finally healed from the festering wound of Ice Town."
Mayor Stice,"Today we put those horribly painful memories behind us as we welcome back the mayor who made all of that possible, Ben Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a typo."
Leslie Knope,That's a major typo.
Leslie Knope,"That says ""Ice Clown."""
Leslie Knope,I'm just realizing now that's not a typo.
Extra,"Hey, aren't you his sister?"
Stephanie Wyatt,I gotta get outta here.
Stephanie Wyatt,"Good luck, Leslie."
Mayor Stice,"Here to accept the key to the city of Partridge, because Mr. Wyatt is conveniently ill, is his wife Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,And it's water.
Mayor Stice,"Uhoh, the key was made of ice."
Mayor Stice,"And much like the hopes and dreams of the people of Partridge, it melted away."
Mayor Stice,"Again, this would all be way more satisfying if Ben was here."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, excuse me."
Leslie Knope,"I would like to point out that we drove all the way here from Pawnee, Indiana, a city with some class, by the way."
Leslie Knope,"And, sure, my husband made an honest mistake 20 years ago."
Leslie Knope,But it was very meaningful that you were gonna finally
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Be able to forgive him.
Mayor Stice,"If it's so meaningful to him, then where is he?"
Leslie Knope,"He's in the hospital, sir."
Leslie Knope,He has a calcified rock lodged in his penis!
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, Ben Wyatt is the best thing to ever come out of this crap town."
Extra,"Oh, yeah?"
Extra,What about Judy Garland?
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's from Partridge?
Extra,She lived here for a while.
Extra,And Lee Janzen.
Leslie Knope,Who's Lee Janzen?
Extra,He's a golfer.
Extra,He's pretty good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ben Wyatt's better than Lee Janzen, and he's better than Judy Garland."
Leslie Knope,That's crazy.
Leslie Knope,Judy Garland's amazing.
Leslie Knope,"But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you because he cared about this town, and he tried to help it."
Leslie Knope,"You know, screw you, Partridge."
Leslie Knope,And a sled is a stupid mascot.
Extra,"Thank you, Ms. Ludgate."
Extra,"It is now quite clear that on innumerable occasions Ron Swanson said he intended to punch councilman Jamm in the face, and then he did."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, but who cares?"
April Ludgate,He says a lot of things.
April Ludgate,"He's always talking about overthrowing the government, but he never does that."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, that'll make a nice pull quote for the article about me taking you to the cleaners."
Extra,"Mr. Swanson, if you'd like to make a statement, you may."
Ron Swanson,"On the night I punched councilman Jamm in the face, I warned him several times to back off."
Ron Swanson,"And instead, he attacked me twice."
Ron Swanson,"Truthfully, I barely registered his attack."
Ron Swanson,"He's incredibly frail, and his arms are weak."
Ron Swanson,"And when I punched him, he dropped so quickly, I thought he was diving towards the ground."
Ron Swanson,I regret nothing.
Ron Swanson,The end.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this turned out better than I ever imagined."
Jeremy Jamm,You got Jammed by your own team.
Jeremy Jamm,Self Jamm!
Jeremy Jamm,"I'll see you in court, Swanson, and, uh, bring your checkbook."
Ron Swanson,I would like to punch you in the face again.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, Paul, let's go."
Leslie Knope,I'm glad you're feeling better.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, get your normal conversation in with me while you can."
Ben Wyatt,Got about 20 minutes before I get all loopy again.
Ben Wyatt,"Mm, let me see the key."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, uh, they took it back."
Leslie Knope,They wanted to get it engraved.
Ben Wyatt,Huh.
Leslie Knope,"You know, the key is just a metaphor."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the real key has been inside you all along."
Ben Wyatt,"It was a setup, wasn't it?"
Ben Wyatt,They were gonna make fun of me?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Ice Town was a debacle.
Ben Wyatt,They'll never get over it.
Ben Wyatt,Just don't know why I got my hopes up.
Leslie Knope,It's so unfair.
Leslie Knope,You worked so hard.
Leslie Knope,You've done so many great things.
Leslie Knope,"And for your hometown to treat you this way is just You know what, screw this."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna make one more stop before we leave.
Leslie Knope,Tuck in your shirt.
Leslie Knope,We're going to city hall.
Ann Perkins,"So, Dr. Van Dyne, we took the compatibility test that you recommended, and we didn't do amazing."
Ann Perkins,"But I'm sure that happens with a lot of couples, right?"
Chris Traeger,And it's not like we failed.
Chris Traeger,"We got a 58%, which as I'm saying it, sounds very clearly like we failed."
Extra,"Look, there are many ways to judge compatibility."
Extra,"Okay, you know what, let's do a little exercise."
Extra,"I'm gonna say something about your future child, and then you just say the first thing that pops into your mind."
Extra,Okay?
Extra,Gender.
Ann Perkins,Girl.
Chris Traeger,Boy.
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Religion.
Chris Traeger,Buddhist.
Ann Perkins,Whatever he wants.
Chris Traeger,Whatever he wants.
Extra,"Um, how 'bout occupation?"
Ann Perkins,Teacher.
Chris Traeger,Sixtime tour de France champion.
Ann Perkins,Really?
Extra,"Okay, I'm sorry, are you guys complete strangers?"
Extra,Is this one of those craigslist father situations?
Chris Traeger,"No, no, no."
Chris Traeger,We actually know each other quite well.
Ann Perkins," Yeah, we used to date actually, but it didn't work out because we had some compatibility issues."
Extra," You know what, why don't we just try one more compatibility test?"
Chris Traeger,"Great, let's do it!"
Ann Perkins,"No, let's not."
April Ludgate," Okay, well, we all told the truth, and Jamm's definitely going to win."
Tom Haverford, What do we do now?
Ron Swanson,I intend to do as the court orders.
Ron Swanson, Do you know if one can pay court-ordered settlements in gold? All of my money's in gold.
Ron Swanson, I also have some money in palladium.
Tom Haverford, What if it's a huge amount? Are you gonna be okay financially?
Ron Swanson, I think so.
Ron Swanson, I'm actually not sure how much money I have.
Ron Swanson,But I do know how many pounds of money I have.
Andy Dwyer," Whoa, whoa, that is awesome."
Tom Haverford," Yes, it is, and I'm definitely tweeting that to Drake to use in his next rhymes, but still I kinda feel like this is our fault."
April Ludgate," Ugh, do we have to do something nice now?"
Leslie Knope,"Let me start by apologizing, mayor Stice."
Leslie Knope, I had no right to disparage your town.
Mayor Stice," Well, I owe you guys an apology too."
Mayor Stice," I, uh, had a little bad publicity lately, and frankly, it's still really easy to score points by bashing Wyatt."
Leslie Knope," Can't you just give Ben a key to the city, here, now, in your office, where no one will know your shame?"
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, babe."
Ben Wyatt,No worries.
Ben Wyatt, I love you.
Leslie Knope, Aw.
Mayor Stice," You know, if people found out I gave Wyatt the key to the city, I would never get re-elected."
Mayor Stice, So no.
Mayor Stice," What are you doing there, Wyatt?"
Ben Wyatt, I'm feeding your eagle.
Ben Wyatt, He's starving.
Leslie Knope," It's it's bronze, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Why?
Leslie Knope,The eagle-- We should go.
Mayor Stice, - Yeah.
Chris Traeger, Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger, I know it didn't seem to go very well at the counselor's.
Chris Traeger," But I have found a new quiz, and I think we should take it."
Ann Perkins, Are you sure? Everything we do makes it seem like it's a bad idea for us to have a kid together.
Ann Perkins, Maybe we shouldn't even be friends.
Chris Traeger, Take a look.
Ann Perkins," ""Will you love our child and work hard to see that he or she has a good life?"""
Chris Traeger,"You see, I think that's the only question that matters."
Chris Traeger, All the rest of it is details.
Ann Perkins, Yes.
Ann Perkins, The answer is yes.
Chris Traeger, I said the exact same thing.
Chris Traeger, We're 100% on the same page.
Ann Perkins, Are you sure about this?
Chris Traeger,"You are caring, intelligent, and reliable."
Chris Traeger, And I am certain that you will literally be the world's best mom.
Ann Perkins, Wow.
Ann Perkins, This is really happening.
Ann Perkins,"You know there's nothing in there yet, right?"
Chris Traeger,"Yes, sorry."
Jeremy Jamm," No, I was with Johnny Cougar Mellencamp at that music fest."
Jeremy Jamm," We both thought, biggest yabbos we've ever seen in-- What the hell? That was important."
April Ludgate," Game's over, councilman."
April Ludgate, Drop the suit.
Jeremy Jamm, And why exactly would I do that?
Tom Haverford, We took a look at your affidavit.
Tom Haverford," We cross-referenced it with telephone records and eyewitness accounts, and, uh-oh, we found 11 lies."
Andy Dwyer," Lying under oath is called perjury, and they should know, they did it yesterday."
Jeremy Jamm," Well, I mean, maybe I accidentally said something that wasn't-- Let me see that."
Tom Haverford," Ow! My wrist! You twisted my arm like a maniac! - Oh, no! -"
April Ludgate,You monster.
Tom Haverford," Ow! You assaulted me, and I'm injured!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Tom, are you okay?"
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, you know what, I see what you're doing."
Jeremy Jamm, I barely touched you.
April Ludgate, That's not what I saw.
Tom Haverford, My face! Is my face still there? What happened to my knees?
Andy Dwyer,Someone please tell me if Tom is okay.
Tom Haverford," - Jamm, I'm gonna sue you."
Jeremy Jamm," - Okay, fine."
Jeremy Jamm," Hey, listen, keep your mouths shut about the affidavit, I'll drop the suit, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Hurry, Tom, let's get you into surgery!"
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm," Yeah, it's me."
Jeremy Jamm, We got Jammed.
Ben Wyatt, My friend Jack and I used to fish this lake in the summer.
Ben Wyatt," One time, our boat almost tipped over, but then it didn't."
Leslie Knope, That's not a great story.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, I had a pretty uneventful childhood."
Leslie Knope, I got you something.
Ben Wyatt, - No way.
Leslie Knope, - Yeah.
Ben Wyatt, Where did you get that?
Leslie Knope,I stole it from mayor Stice's office.
Leslie Knope, Screw that guy.
Leslie Knope, You should have it.
Ben Wyatt, You're the best wife in the world.
Ben Wyatt, But I don't want this.
Leslie Knope, Really?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I mean, I love Partridge, but I have Pawnee now."
Ben Wyatt, And I have you.
Leslie Knope," Well, I'm not giving it back to Stice."
Leslie Knope, - That guy sucks.
Ben Wyatt, - Yeah.
Ben Wyatt," Well, you know what then?"
Extra,"Hey, lake's not a garbage can, pal."
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, sorry, it was symbolic."
Extra," Is that Ben Wyatt? Get the hell out of here, Ice Town!"
Leslie Knope,Run! Run!
Ben Wyatt,"Go, go, go, go, go."
Leslie Knope, Sorry.

Harris,Welcome to Animal Control.
Harris,Let me show you around.
Harris,Those are some chairs.
Harris,That's a cat or opossum.
Harris,"Oh, this is a napkin where I wrote down a cool name for a dog."
Harris,"""Bark Obama."""
Brett,Right?
Leslie Knope,Is that what's happening here?
Brett,Oh.
Brett,Yo.
Brett,Yeah.
Brett,We found this bird outside.
Brett,"We tried to turn it into a work whistle, like in the beginning of The Flintstones."
Brett,"Tougher than it looked, though."
Leslie Knope,"We have a massive pest problem in this town, and it's because the Animal Control Department has been disaster at catching animals."
Leslie Knope,They're great at ingesting and selling marijuana.
Leslie Knope,This place is a miserable suck hole run by two pothead losers.
Leslie Knope,It's completely and utterly mismanaged.
Harris,Thanks!
Chris Traeger,"It does seem to be very poorly run, but we've only been here for two minutes."
Chris Traeger,There may be a method to their madness.
Chris Traeger,There's more than one way to skin a cat.
Brett,Four.
Brett,There's four ways to skin a cat.
Brett,Regular blade
Chris Traeger,Ow!
Chris Traeger,Ah!
Chris Traeger,What is this?
Harris,"Coyote trap, dude."
Chris Traeger,Ah!
Chris Traeger,This hurts!
Brett,"Yeah, we got, like, a huge vermin problem."
Brett,"I mean, we've been meaning to call somebody about it, but you know, nobody get on the phone."
Leslie Knope,You're the people you would be calling.
Harris,That is so trippy.
Chris Traeger,Ow!
Chris Traeger,You're fired!
Chris Traeger,You're fired!
Chris Traeger,The whole department is fired.
Chris Traeger,"Ow, this hurts!"
Chris Traeger,This was one of my running feet!
Brett,"Yo, let's go to Jamaica."
Harris,"No, we should go to Jamaica."
Harris,"Oh, is that what you said?"
Brett,"Yeah, dog."
Ann Perkins,"Ron, you've been sweating in here all day."
Ann Perkins,Are you drinking any fluids?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, plenty."
Ann Perkins,"No, you need to drink water."
Ron Swanson,"Usually, I take it neat, but I will make an exception in the name of health."
Ron Swanson,"Last night, I watched a movie with Diane and the girls in which an orange fish is separated from his father."
Ron Swanson,"The children were sniffling, which I believed to be due to the sad nature of the film."
Ron Swanson,I was wrong.
Ann Perkins,"You need to take off those layers, rehydrate, and go to the doctor."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for your concern, I will be fine."
Ron Swanson,Please turn the thermostat up to 90 and leave me alone.
Ann Perkins,"Ron, this isn't safe."
Ron Swanson,I am a grown man.
Ron Swanson,"I have had a cold before, I need no help, so if you don't mind"
Ann Perkins,That seems about right.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, pop quiz."
Tom Haverford,Name the scent.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, ""Spasm."""
Ben Wyatt,"No, ""Butter Face""!"
Tom Haverford,Very good!
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"I'm trying to get more big companies to donate to the Sweetums Foundation, and tom got us a meeting with Dennis Feinstein, Pawnee's premiere manufacturer of perfumes and cologne."
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"Or possibly, insecticide."
Ben Wyatt,Whew!
Tom Haverford,"Dennis Feinstein belongs to a new generation of wealth rappers, tech geniuses, X games medallists, and of course, ""scent artists."""
Tom Haverford,The man owns a Rolexus.
Tom Haverford,It's a Lexus filled with Rolexes.
Ben Wyatt,What's the point of that?
Tom Haverford,"To have it, which he does."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll lay out the benefits of donating."
Ben Wyatt,Tom will flatter and schmooze as only tom can.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, you know, this is just a learning experience for you, so you just watch and listen."
Tom Haverford,"I had to pull a lot of strings to get this meeting, so please, no one embarrass me."
Tom Haverford,"Ben, put on something decent, like a tux."
Tom Haverford,"Andy, you're hopeless, just take a shower."
Andy Dwyer,"I already took what I call a ""dwyer shower."""
Andy Dwyer,I rubbed my armpits with air fresheners.
Andy Dwyer,New car.
Leslie Knope,Animal control has long been a repository for some of this government's most incompetent employees.
Leslie Knope,Jerry Gergich got his start there.
Councilman Howser,Well.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, well."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, so our new director needs to be competent, effective, and not completely stoned all the time."
Jeremy Jamm,"I'm way ahead of you there, girly."
Jeremy Jamm,I got the perfect guy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Friend of mine, bit of an alcoholic, a little grabby, either a war hero or war criminal, depending on who you ask, but a good dude."
Chris Traeger,How do you know him?
Jeremy Jamm,I do his teeth.
Jeremy Jamm,"A few coffee stains up front, but his canines are insane."
Leslie Knope,"Gosh, Jeremy, he sounds perfect."
Leslie Knope,Are his gums great too?
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,"They are excellent, beet red."
Leslie Knope,I was being sarcastic.
Leslie Knope,I think we should open this to the floor  for more discussion.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, maybe you would like to explain this to her, please?"
Councilman Howser,"Traditionally, Leslie, the councilmen just kind of take turns on departmental appointments."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, this one is mine, then Dexhart, then you."
Jeremy Jamm,This whole place runs on dibs.
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?
Leslie Knope,You guys are all fine with this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Milton's asleep, but the rest of you?"
Leslie Knope,This is how departments get mismanaged.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,We are going to be thorough.
Leslie Knope,"I'm going to find a candidate, and I encourage you all to do the same, and then, we will interview all of them."
Jeremy Jamm,Boring!
Leslie Knope,"""Boring"" is my middle name, so my thoroughly vetted candidate is going to blow your candidate out of the water."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I guess I'm leaving."
Chris Traeger,Good to see you.
Chris Traeger,Great meeting!
Ron Swanson,I'd like to object again to being brought here against my will.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, I'm just gonna doublecheck your form here."
Ann Perkins,Ron!
Ann Perkins,You redacted all the information.
Ron Swanson,I answered some of them.
Ann Perkins,"For ""date of birth,"" you wrote ""springtime."""
Ron Swanson,Which is true.
Ann Perkins,Everything you write down is confidential.
Ann Perkins,We need you to give real answers.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ann Perkins,How many drinks of alcohol do you consume a week?
Ron Swanson,One.
Ann Perkins,"That's it, one drink?"
Ron Swanson,One shelf.
Ann Perkins,Do you exercise?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,Lovemaking and woodworking.
Ann Perkins,Do you have any history of mental illness in your family?
Ron Swanson,I have an uncle who does yoga.

Ron Swanson,Cowardice and weak willed men.
Ron Swanson,And hazelnuts.
Ann Perkins,Sexual history.
Ron Swanson,Epic and private.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go get your doctor.
Ann Perkins,"He's a rude, brash jerk."
Ann Perkins,You'll love him.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna cut right to the chase.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't like charity.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't get it.
Dennis Feinstein,"Feels to me like I'm giving money away, and getting nothing in return."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's not true."
Ben Wyatt,You can really help your personal brand if you show that you're a mogul that gives as much as he gets.
Dennis Feinstein,"If I give as much as I get, I'm giving 20 million dollars."
Dennis Feinstein,Ay yi yi.
Dennis Feinstein,"That's how much I'm worth, 20 million dollars. Yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, he's disgusting, but I want to take his money and give it to needy people, so I'm just gonna keep on smiling."
Ben Wyatt,Yay!
Andy Dwyer,"People who give to charity, they get amazing press."
Dennis Feinstein,Huh.
Andy Dwyer,Like Bill Gates.
Andy Dwyer,Have you ever heard of Bill Gates?
Andy Dwyer,"He lives in Seattle, guy with glasses."
Andy Dwyer,Bill Gates?
Dennis Feinstein,I know who Bill Gates is.
Dennis Feinstein,"Bill Gates is, like, a super nerd."
Dennis Feinstein,Is this some sort of nerd thing?
Dennis Feinstein,Are you calling me a nerd?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, he meant Mark Cuban."
Dennis Feinstein,Cuban?
Dennis Feinstein,"Now, that's the kind of guy I can hang out with Mark Cuban."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm interested now.
Dennis Feinstein,Keep talking.
April Ludgate,Stay still.
Chris Traeger,"""Don't think about how much this itches."""
Chris Traeger,That's very good advice.
Leslie Knope,"I have to say, this is the greatest search committee ever assembled to find a new Animal Control Department head."
Leslie Knope,Chris Traeger can do more with one foot than most people can do with three.
Chris Traeger,I'm not going to lie to you.
Chris Traeger,I needed that.
Chris Traeger,I know.
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate is beautiful
April Ludgate,Stop.
Leslie Knope,You are talented
April Ludgate,No.
Leslie Knope,"But most importantly, you're passionate about animals."
April Ludgate,That's true.
April Ludgate,It's because I'm half wolf.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Donna, you took a look at all the resumes, so send in the best candidate."
Harris,Wassup?
Harris,I'm Harris.
Harris,I'm 33 years young.
Harris,I have my cousin Jason's truck for two more weeks.
Harris,I have one testicle whacamole accident and I'm down to clown.
Chris Traeger,"Harris, we know who you are."
Chris Traeger,I literally just fired you.
Harris,"Oh, is this that job?"
Harris,That's crazy!
Harris,Never mind.
Leslie Knope,Why would you think Harris would be the best candidate?
Donna Meagle,'Cause he's one of only two applicants with actual experience at animal control.
Leslie Knope,Uhohh.
Leslie Knope,Does that mean
Brett,What up?
Brett,"Yo, my name is Brett."
Brett,"I like burgers, and also, I'm very high right now."
Harris,"Dude, this is hilarious!"
Brett,"Oh, yo!"
Harris,We live together!
Brett,"Yo, we live in the same place!"
Harris,This is my boy!
Brett,"Hey, ""Wyld Stallyns""!"
April Ludgate,You guys know why there are all those cops out there?
Brett,Where are the cops at?
Harris,I gotta go.
Brett,Yo.
Ben Wyatt,"A lot of charities waste their money on overhead, but we at the Sweetums Foundation,  spend our money wisely."
Dennis Feinstein,Okay.
Dennis Feinstein,You know what?
Dennis Feinstein,Shut up.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Dennis Feinstein,"You guys seem like pretty cool dudes and I'm feeling pretty generous, so why don't we take this conversation to the Pawnee Smokehouse?"
Dennis Feinstein,"Dumb Dumb Eddie, get the checkbook."
Dennis Feinstein,We're going out.
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,"Guys, we're going out."
Dennis Feinstein,Let's scent up!
Tom Haverford,"I call dibs on ""Ooze."""
Andy Dwyer,"I got ""Money Shot."""
Dennis Feinstein,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I got ""Blood Spurt."
Dennis Feinstein,"Ooh, no, don't use that one."
Dennis Feinstein,"Eh, go ahead."
Leslie Knope,So why do you want this job?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I love cats, and dogs sure are great."
Chris Traeger,"Well, you have all the qualifications."
Chris Traeger,You went to a four year college.
Jerry Gergich,"Actually, when I went there, it was just a two year college."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, so you're not even technically qualified to work at your current job."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, geez."
April Ludgate,You're fired.
April Ludgate,Get out.
Chris Traeger,"No, no, you're not fired, but we're definitely going to have to lower your salary."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, fair's fair."
Extra,"I am very, very, very, very frightened of animals."
Leslie Knope,This may not be the job for you.
Extra,"I know, but my therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, told me to confront my fears."
Chris Traeger,You see Dr. Richard Nygard?
Chris Traeger,I'm a Nygardian too!
Chris Traeger,Would you sign my cast?
Extra,"Yes, but just please don't give me this job."
Extra,"The spaying and neutering tools, do you think those fit humans?"
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
Extra,And is there a lock on the spaying room door?
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
April Ludgate,Mmmmm.
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for coming in.
Extra,Thanks for having me.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Orin."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much for applying, now leave."
April Ludgate,"Hey, give him a chance."
April Ludgate,What makes you qualified for animal control?
Orin,"I studied zoology in college, and I can control animals with my mind."
Leslie Knope,Get out.
Orin,I made you say that.
Chris Traeger,I liked him.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that was a truly depressing slate of candidates."
Chris Traeger,I think you've got several options.
Chris Traeger,"They're all terrible, but you have them."
Ron Swanson,"Before you begin, a few ground rules."
Ron Swanson,"I need you to explain everything you do before you do it, so I can determine whether I will allow you Oh!"
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,Balsa wood?
Ron Swanson,You could at least use mahogany.
Dr. Harris,There's something occluding your ear.
Ron Swanson,It's sawdust.
Ron Swanson,Just blow.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Dr. Harris,You've got strep throat.
Dr. Harris,I'm writing you a prescription for penicillin.
Ann Perkins,We'll have the rest of your test results in about 20 minutes.
Ann Perkins,Cholesterol
Ron Swanson,Not interested.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Dr. Harris,Wish all patients were like that.
Dr. Harris,It's really annoying when they ask questions.
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, they claim that smoking is bad for you, but is there any medical evidence to back that up?"
Tom Haverford,Great point.
Ben Wyatt,So the Sweetums Foundation has really accomplished a lot recently.
Ben Wyatt,Our health care outreach program has reduced pink eye in the rural community by 30% to 70%.
Dennis Feinstein,Snooze.
Dennis Feinstein,You guys ever been fox hunting?
Dennis Feinstein,I have my own foxes flown in from Russia.
Dennis Feinstein,We drug them pretty heavily so they can't get very far.
Dennis Feinstein,"In fact, mostly, they just flop around on the ground."
Dennis Feinstein,"Makes it easier to just walk up and ""pow!"""
Dennis Feinstein,Stupid foxes.
Dennis Feinstein,It's deeply erotic.
Tom Haverford,That sounds amazing.
Dennis Feinstein,We should go hunting sometime.
Tom Haverford,I'd love to.
Tom Haverford,I could bust out my Ralph Lauren Fall 2010 collection.
Tom Haverford,Copped it in 2012.
Tom Haverford,Clearance rack!
Dennis Feinstein,"Wear whatever you want, as long as it's not too bright or reflective."
Dennis Feinstein,"You know, I want you blending in to the surroundings."
Dennis Feinstein,How fast can you run?
Tom Haverford,I think that guy wants to hunt me.
Ben Wyatt,"So, Dennis, not to interrupt"
Dennis Feinstein,Then don't.
Dennis Feinstein,Boom!
Dennis Feinstein,Ha ha!
Dennis Feinstein,Shut him right down!
Dennis Feinstein,I have heard so much talking from you.
Dennis Feinstein,I don't want to hear your fat mouth say anything else.
Dennis Feinstein,Boo!
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,You're a dick.
Dennis Feinstein,Excuse me?
Ben Wyatt,Andy
Dennis Feinstein,How dare you talk to me like that?
Dennis Feinstein,Where are your manners?
Dennis Feinstein,"You come to me asking for money, and you treat me like this?"
Dennis Feinstein,I don't think so.
Dennis Feinstein,Wrap it up!
Dennis Feinstein,We're done!
Dennis Feinstein,Hey!
Dennis Feinstein,Show these garbage people out!
Dennis Feinstein,"Take the garbage out, Eddie."
Tom Haverford,Donna?
Donna Meagle,Gentlemen.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Palletta, what is your occupation currently?"
Extra,"I run a children's break dancing studio called ""D.J. Jazzy Vern's."""
Leslie Knope,Do you have any experience with animals?
Extra,"Uh, a bat landed on my face once."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, you know what, he's not a rack of ribs, so stop grilling him."
Jeremy Jamm,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,"Ribs are better smoked than grilled, so unnailed it, with the back part of the hammer."
Extra,How many more questions are there gonna be?
Extra,"Jamm said if I got my teeth whitened,  I'd just get the gig."
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, ga ga gaho."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hold up, that's enough."
Jeremy Jamm,"Thank you, you're done."
Jeremy Jamm,"You did a heck of a job, Vernie."
Extra,"Thanks, Jimbo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Not bad, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, if he can catch raccoons as well as he can teach six year olds to pop and lock, he's a home run."
Leslie Knope,That is an insane statement.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I don't see anyone better."
Leslie Knope,"April, I got a present for you."
April Ludgate,I don't like lotion.
April Ludgate,I like my hands to be cracked and calloused like a railway worker.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud."
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,"On an unrelated note, do you remember all those candidates we were interviewing for the Animal Control job and how they were all total losers who didn't care about animals?"
Leslie Knope,"Except for Jerry, who was great, but who we had to pass on for other reasons."
Jerry Gergich,I was just happy to be considered.
Leslie Knope,"Anyhoo, I nominated you for the position, and your confirmation hearing is in three minutes."
Leslie Knope,Surprise.
April Ludgate,"No, I don't want the job."
April Ludgate,You can have your mud and blood back.
Leslie Knope,"April, please, you will be so good at it."
Leslie Knope,You are so good with animals.
April Ludgate,"Even if I wanted the job, I don't want to do the stupid confirmation hearing, okay?"
April Ludgate,Stupid councilmen asking me stupid questions about my stupid life it seems stupid.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's easy they'll just ask you a few questions."
Leslie Knope,Let's practice.
Leslie Knope,What's your name?
April Ludgate,Batman.
April Ludgate,See?
April Ludgate,I failed.
Leslie Knope,"I will be there to help you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I will be your Pocahontas.
Leslie Knope,Climb into my papoose.
Leslie Knope,Please do this.
Leslie Knope,"Please, please."
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,Do it.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna do it.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
April Ludgate,But only if you divorce Ben.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, don't even joke about that."
April Ludgate,What?
April Ludgate,I really think he's wrong for you.
Councilman Howser,We now resume the confirmation proceedings for director of the Animal Control Department.
Jeremy Jamm,Okay.
Jeremy Jamm,"Let's tear this chick a new one, shall we?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, we have found many emails showing how you sexually harassed Leslie Knope's assistant."
April Ludgate,Andy?
April Ludgate,That's my husband.
Councilman Dexhart,"They were still extremely graphic, and appreciated by all of us."
Councilman Dexhart,"I had never heard of several of those terms, and I'm a freak."
April Ludgate,Those are personal.
April Ludgate,No one's allowed to read those.
Jeremy Jamm,You once posted a video of yourself drinking alcohol in City Hall while you were still a minor.
Jeremy Jamm,How do you justify that?
April Ludgate,Easily.
April Ludgate,Alcohol is delicious and fun
Leslie Knope,Damentally a substance that should not be abused.
Leslie Knope,"I agree, April."
Leslie Knope,Very good point.
Jeremy Jamm,Wow.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, are you a ventriloquist?"
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that is amazing how you make your words come out of Ms. Knope's mouth."
Jeremy Jamm,Would you like to put her on your knee?
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, that'd be really fun."
Jeremy Jamm,"Just three years ago, you drove"
Chris Traeger,She is not ready.
Chris Traeger,"Now, you've rushed her into this, and now, Jamm's sharpening the knives."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, no one needs to be jammed today."
Leslie Knope," Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction."
Leslie Knope, Grab that gavel and break your other foot.
Chris Traeger," I like the idea of double the signings, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives."
Leslie Knope, Don't panic.
Leslie Knope, Maybe she can pull this off.
April Ludgate," I guess my first move as director would be to fill your office, house, and car with snakes, and then train a crow to fly up your butt."
Leslie Knope, Okay! Let's take a brief recess.
Dennis Feinstein," Well, well, well."
Dennis Feinstein, Look who's back.
Ben Wyatt," Thank you so much for seeing us again, sir."
Ben Wyatt, We just came to apologize.
Andy Dwyer," Mr. Dennis Feinstein, let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad."
Andy Dwyer," I just started working here, and I really want to do a good job, and I blew it."
Dennis Feinstein, Thank you for saying that.
Dennis Feinstein," Thought about it last night, and I decided that if you came in here and apologized to me like a man, that I would forgive you, and that's what you've done, so you're forgiven."
Dennis Feinstein," To that end, here is a check for 25,000 dollars for your charity."
Dennis Feinstein,"Go out there and help some kids with their pink eye, or whatever it is you guys are doing."
Ben Wyatt," Mr. Feinstein, thank you."
Ben Wyatt, This is extremely generous.
Dennis Feinstein," It's nothing, really."
Dennis Feinstein, I'm happy to help.
Ben Wyatt," This check is made out to ""Go [bleep] yourself."""
Dennis Feinstein,In your face! Dennis Feinstein helps no man! Get the hell out of my office!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's your problem, man? -"
Andy Dwyer,Why did you make me - apologize to him?
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, guys, just hold it-- hold on a sec, okay? Mr. Feinstein, with all due respect you are a major dick."
Dennis Feinstein, - What?
Ben Wyatt,Run!
Dennis Feinstein,"Eddie, get my crossbow."
Andy Dwyer, - Crossbow? What the--
Dennis Feinstein,You will pay for this!
Ann Perkins,"Hey, you look better."
Ann Perkins, I guess actual medicine can be effective.
Ann Perkins, Who'da thunk?
Ron Swanson,Please leave me alone.
Ann Perkins, Not until we go over your test results and your blood work.
Ann Perkins, Your blood pressure looks fine.
Ann Perkins," I'm not sure how this is possible, but your cholesterol is 120, which is the lowest I've ever seen."
Ron Swanson," What's ""cholesterol""?"
Ann Perkins,"And the only problem I see is that your potassium's low, so just eat a banana once in awhile."
Ron Swanson," No, thank you."
Ron Swanson," I live the way I live, I eat the things I eat, and I'll die the way I'll die."
Ann Perkins, That's oddly beautiful but also stupid.
Ann Perkins," You're not alone in the world anymore, Ron."
Ann Perkins," You're dating a woman who has two kids, so every three days, think about Ivy and Zoe and Diane, and eat a damn banana."
Leslie Knope," I am so sorry, April."
Leslie Knope," You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault."
Leslie Knope," It's not you, it's me."
April Ludgate,Are you breaking up with me?
Leslie Knope, I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control.
Leslie Knope, I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director.
Leslie Knope, He does have good teeth.
April Ludgate," No! All right, I have an idea."
April Ludgate, Trust me.
Jeremy Jamm," Ms. Ludgate, it is the opinion of this committee that you are terrible."
Jeremy Jamm, Can you give me even one reason why you're the right man for this job?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate, But neither is your guy.
April Ludgate, Neither of us should get the job.
Jeremy Jamm," Oh, no? Why is that?"
April Ludgate,There shouldn't be a separate Animal Control Department.
April Ludgate," Its budget is tiny, and it's ineffective, and frankly, no one could change that."
April Ludgate, So I think it should be absorbed into the Parks Department.
Leslie Knope, That is a genius idea.
Leslie Knope, Somebody wake up Milton.
Leslie Knope, History is being made.
Councilman Milton, Iwo Jima!
April Ludgate,"Animal Control would be way more effective if it ran through the Parks Department, and if you want, I can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummies to understand, dummies."
Chris Traeger," Councilman, you have to admit that that idea makes a lot of sense."
Jeremy Jamm, Hang on a second.
Jeremy Jamm," You seem to be forgetting that I already told Vern he got the job, and he already bought a new speedboat."
Leslie Knope," Well, I hope he kept a receipt."
Leslie Knope," That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec."
Councilman Howser, I second that.
Leslie Knope, Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Look at that, April."
Leslie Knope, You won over Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm," Uh, no, she didn't."
Jeremy Jamm, I'm just sick of being on the losing side.
Jeremy Jamm, I'm going to tell everyone this was my idea.
Jeremy Jamm, Retro-jammed.
Andy Dwyer, What do we do now? Can I apologize again? I'm getting really at apologizing.
Tom Haverford, Screw that.
Tom Haverford, You should apologize for apologizing to that guy.
Ben Wyatt," God, we really could've used the money, though."
Ben Wyatt, Just wish we'd made a bigger impression.
Tom Haverford," You did-- I was really impressed by all the stuff the foundation's done for all them poor homies, so you know what? Rent-A-Swag is gonna donate five cents from every dollar we make this month."
Tom Haverford," It's not Feinstein money, but it'll help."
Ben Wyatt," That's very generous, Tom."
Ben Wyatt, Feinstein's the worst.
Ben Wyatt, I hope he gets into an accident driving that Rolex Mobile.
Tom Haverford," For the last time, it's a Rolexus, and you can't drive it."
Leslie Knope," April, I have a gift for you."
Leslie Knope, Ta da.
Chris Traeger," At Leslie's suggestion, I have made you deputy director of Animal Control within the Parks Department."
Chris Traeger," You'll be amazing at it, and the best part, there is no confirmation hearing."
April Ludgate, How did you make this plaque so quickly?
Leslie Knope,I had it made your first week here.
Leslie Knope," I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared."
April Ludgate,Can I hire an intern?
Leslie Knope,Not yet.
April Ludgate,Can I hire a Mexican elf?
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate,Can I buy a child bride? 
Leslie Knope,No.
April Ludgate, Then how is this even a promotion?
Leslie Knope, Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors.
Leslie Knope, It should operate based on good ideas.
Leslie Knope," April had the best idea, and today the best idea won."
Chris Traeger," Leslie, I really have to go to the bathroom."
Leslie Knope," Oh, yeah, right, sorry."
Chris Traeger, You don't have to come in with me.
Leslie Knope, I wasn't going to.
Chris Traeger, Could you pick up the pace a little bit?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Miss Daisy."
Donna Meagle,"Night, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,"Night, Ron."
Ron Swanson," Ladies, ladies."

Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,Ted!
Leslie Knope,"Article Two, Section Two of the Pawnee Charter reads, ""Be it decreed: Should the taxation of tea ""rise to an unacceptable level, citizens shall dump Ted into Ramsett Lake."""
Leslie Knope,Does anyone object?
Theodore,"As always, I object."
Garth Blunden,"Nay, enough dithering!"
Garth Blunden,Dump the miscreant!
Garth Blunden,Boo!
Leslie Knope,"Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817."
Leslie Knope,"Historical fun fact when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their oldtimey script made one of the ""a""s look like a ""d,"" so ""tea"" became ""Ted."""
Leslie Knope,It's just one of those little things that reminds us of Pawnee's rich and vibrant past.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we get to go find a guy named Ted and throw him in a lake."
Leslie Knope,One!
Theodore,I don't even go by Ted!
Leslie Knope,Two!
Theodore,I go by Theodore!
Leslie Knope,Three!
Theodore,Aah!
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ted."
Andy Dwyer,Great job today.
Andy Dwyer,"You were so funny when you were like, ""My cell phone, I left it in my pocket."""
Andy Dwyer,"Then you checked it, remember, and it didn't work."
Theodore,"Yeah, that was hilarious."
Theodore,"Listen, I am just here to say that I am done with Ted Party Day."
Andy Dwyer,Ha!
Andy Dwyer,Classic Ted.
Theodore,I'm serious.
Theodore,I'm not getting dumped in that lake anymore.
Theodore,"And I talked to the other Teds in town, and they're not doing it either."
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter."
Leslie Knope,"And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year."
Leslie Knope,That's the way it's always been done.
Theodore,"Okay, first of all, ""That's the way it's always been done"" is not a good reason to keep doing something."
Theodore,"Second, it was a misprint."
Theodore,"They clearly meant ""tea."""
Leslie Knope,I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.
Theodore,"Okay, fine."
Theodore,You want to enforce every single old law we have on our books?
Theodore,"Hey, can I see your keys for a second?"
Theodore,Here's a quarter.
Theodore,I own your car now.
Tom Haverford,Wha
Theodore,Sorry.
Theodore,The Pawnee Charter clearly states that any white citizen has the right to seize any Indian property for 25 cents.
Leslie Knope,That is an outdated and racist law.
Leslie Knope,"And obviously they meant ""American Indian."""
Theodore,"Whoa, I think we should be careful when we speculate what the Founders intended when they wrote the charter."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ted."
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You're quoting me back to me.
Leslie Knope,But I'm gonna quote me back to you and say that Ted Party Day will never change.
Theodore,Uhoh.
Theodore,"You, a woman, just raised your voice to a landowning male."
Theodore,"According to a Pawnee statute passed in 1868, I get to do this."
Leslie Knope,I was not aware of that statute.
April Ludgate,"Ron, you have to help me."
April Ludgate,Chris is making me do some stupid management training leadership course.
Chris Traeger,"Now that you run the Animal Control department, you have qualified for the Chris Traeger Management Training Seminar or ""Katumts."""
Chris Traeger,"It's not a great acronym, but it is a great seminar."
April Ludgate,Can you get me out of it?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing."
Ron Swanson,But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing.
Ron Swanson,I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson and April Ludgate, literally my two favorite people in the catalogued universe."
Ron Swanson,April will not be participating in your pointless course because she has more important things to do like not participating in your pointless course.
Chris Traeger,I just want April to become as great a department head as yourself.
Ron Swanson,Which is why this is pointless.
Ron Swanson,"I've been head of the Parks department for 12 years, and I never had any ""management training"" course."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've never been ""katumtsed?"""
Chris Traeger,I am legally required to katumts every department head.
Chris Traeger,"Otherwise, we are open to all kinds of liability."
Ron Swanson,What are you saying?
Chris Traeger,"I'm saying that tomorrow during the seminar, April is going to have a classmate."
Chris Traeger,And spoiler alert
April Ludgate,it's Alf.
Chris Traeger,It's you.
Ron Swanson,This went poorly.
Ann Perkins,"What, no."
Ann Perkins,Damn it!
Donna Meagle,What are you bidding on?
Donna Meagle,It better not be Terrence Howard's tank top from Hustle & Flow.
Ann Perkins,It is not.
Donna Meagle,Good.
Donna Meagle,"Cause I am bidding on it and I am ready to spend an amount that my accountant calls ""Dangerous and irresponsible."""
Ann Perkins,JJ's diner put an old waffle iron up for auction.
Ann Perkins,It's the perfect breakfast day gift for Leslie.
Donna Meagle,"""Breakfast day""?"
Ann Perkins,Leslie has anniversaries for everything.
Ann Perkins,"""Zoo day,"" first time we went to the zoo together."
Ann Perkins,"""Double date day,"" it was the first time we went on a double date."
Ann Perkins,"""Daniel DayLewis day."""
Ann Perkins,"""Talk like a pirate day""."
Ann Perkins,"Talk like a Pittsburgh pirate day,"" which why and how?"
Ann Perkins,This calendar was last year's calendar day present celebrating the first time she ever bought me a calendar.
Donna Meagle,You have to buy a present for every one of these?
Ann Perkins,"She always tells me not to, but then she buys me something that's awesome and thoughtful, and then I feel terrible."
Ann Perkins,But that's the thing.
Ann Perkins,This is the perfect present.
Ann Perkins,"I just keep getting outbid by someone named ""Tall Tiereeon Lannister."""
Ann Perkins,What kind of name is Tiereeon anyway?
Donna Meagle,"You're kidding, right?"
Donna Meagle,Tyrion Lannister?
Donna Meagle,Lord of Casterly Rock?
Donna Meagle,The Half Man?
Donna Meagle,You don't watch Game of Thrones?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,You do?
Donna Meagle,Hell yeah.
Donna Meagle,Have you seen those Dothraki dudes?
Donna Meagle,They can get it.
Donna Meagle,Everybody on that show can get it.
Ann Perkins,I think I know who I'm bidding against.
Leslie Knope,"I now realize that I was wrong, and it's time that we purged the books of many of our town's outdated and obscure laws."
Leslie Knope,"The bill that I have written with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete laws such as all menstruating women shall be confined to their bathtubs and Article Two, aka, Ted Party Day."
Leslie Knope,The floor is now open for public comments.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, here we go."
Garth Blunden,Thank you.
Garth Blunden,"My name is Garth Blunden, and I object to your ridiculous proposal."
Garth Blunden,The Pawnee Charter shall not be changed.
Garth Blunden,"Not today, not ever!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, a lot of passion, Mr. Blunden."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much.
Leslie Knope,Your objection is noted and officially in the record.
Leslie Knope,Shall we proceed to a vote?
Garth Blunden,No.
Garth Blunden,"No, we shall not."
Garth Blunden,"Article Seven, Section Three allows for a ""Citizen filibuster."""
Garth Blunden,"If I stand here and refuse to yield my time, you are prohibited from voting on the bill."
Leslie Knope,"That section defines ""Buffalo meat"" as acceptable currency."
Garth Blunden,Is that the Buffalo meat one?
Leslie Knope,Mmhmm.
Garth Blunden,"I meant Article Three, Section Seven."
Garth Blunden,Let the filibustering begin.
Garth Blunden,I would now like to share some ideas I have for J.J. Abrams' seventh chapter in the Star Wars' saga.
Garth Blunden,Pan down from the twin suns of Tatooine.
Garth Blunden,We are now close on the mouth of the Sarlacc Pit.
Garth Blunden,"After a beat, the gloved Mandalorian armor gauntlet of Boba Fett grabs onto the sand outside of the Sarlacc Pit and the feared bounty hunter pulls himself from the maw of the sand beast."
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, he's right."
Leslie Knope,He can do this.
Leslie Knope,This is exactly why we need to modernize these laws.
Leslie Knope,This kind of thing made sense when we had council in a barn and there were but now this is nuts.
Garth Blunden,"If he holds the reality gem, that means he can jump from different realities."
Garth Blunden,This will be our link to the Marvel Universe from the Star Wars Universe.
Garth Blunden,Imagine those who were up against Chewbacca 'cause that's gonna happen.
Garth Blunden,"After a beat, Luke says, ""Darth Vader was my father, but Ben Kenobi was my master."""
Garth Blunden,And he cuts Hannibal Lecter in half.
Leslie Knope,"Mr. Blunden, look, the laws I'm trying to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and they're embarrassing to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,Repealing them would show that we're changing with the times.
Garth Blunden,You can't just change the charter willynilly.
Garth Blunden,"You start by casually repealing a couple of ""old laws,"" the next thing you know, your jackbooted storm troopers are kicking in my door and arresting my wife for no reason if I were married."
Leslie Knope,"By ""jackbooted storm troopers,"" do you mean the Pawnee Police Department?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Clyde."
Extra,"Hi, Leslie."
Extra,Good Danish today.
Garth Blunden,"The Pawnee charter is not a ""living document,"" Ms. Knope."
Garth Blunden,You have no respect for the traditions of this town.
Leslie Knope,I absolutely do.
Leslie Knope,I used to give tours at the Pawnee Historical House.
Leslie Knope,"Three times, ""Employee Of The Fortnight."""
Garth Blunden,"Oh, big deal, you put on a costume for a couple hours."
Garth Blunden,"By that logic, every time I go to bed at night, I am Wolverine."
Leslie Knope,You bought XMen pajamas?
Garth Blunden,"I won them, madam, in a raffle."
Leslie Knope,"The point is is that our Founding Fathers were brilliant and they were courageous, but they also had wooden teeth and pooped in holes in the ground."
Leslie Knope,It was a more primitive time.
Garth Blunden,It was a better time.
Garth Blunden,You wouldn't have survived two weeks in their day.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,How about a little wager?
Leslie Knope,"How about you and I go live in that historical house, no modern technology, If you last longer, I withdraw my bill."
Leslie Knope,"I win, you stop this nonsense."
Garth Blunden,You have yourself a deal.
Chris Traeger,"Please write down what you hope to gain from the seminar, seal it in the envelope, and then we'll open it when it's over."
Ron Swanson,When is this over?
Chris Traeger,As soon as you learn to embrace the power of positive motivation.
Chris Traeger,It's a nine hour seminar over two days.
April Ludgate,Whoa!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, good."
Chris Traeger,"All right, let's begin."
Chris Traeger,"Hop on board ""The Management Train."""
Chris Traeger,First stop Motivation Station.
Chris Traeger,All aboard!
Ann Perkins,Stop bidding on my waffle iron.
Ben Wyatt,You're FutureMrsTigerWoods?
Ann Perkins,"I made that profile, like, ten years ago."
Ann Perkins,I don't know how to change it.
Ann Perkins,The point is I'm getting that waffle iron for Leslie for breakfast day.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, no, you're not."
Ben Wyatt,I'm getting it for her for waffle day.
Ben Wyatt,"Wait, you have a breakfast day too?"
Ben Wyatt,Mine's in June.
Ann Perkins,"Please, Ben."
Ann Perkins,"This is the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hung out at JJ's, which she considers the beginning of our friendship."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, imagine being married to her."
Ben Wyatt,It's like being smothered with a hand quilted pillow filled with cherished memories.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, honey."
Ben Wyatt,I love you.
Ann Perkins,"Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,We've lost the auction.
Ann Perkins,What no.
Ben Wyatt,"Somebody swooped in at the last second,  and now we're both screwed."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't."
Ben Wyatt,"The Lannisters, while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example."
Ann Perkins,This is why we don't hang out.
Chris Traeger,Think of yourselves as engineers steering a locomotive of positivity that runs on team power.
Ron Swanson,"First of all, you don't ""steer"" a locomotive."
Ron Swanson,The tracks do.
Ron Swanson,"Second, there are only three ways to motivate people money, fear, and hunger."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, I disagree."
Chris Traeger,"What about encouragement, appreciation, and smiles."
Chris Traeger,"When people feel supported, they will literally explode with productivity."
April Ludgate,Can you guys just figure out which way is better and tell me so we can leave?
Chris Traeger,"Thank you for your input, April, but the katumts requires that we follow a very specific syllabus."
April Ludgate,"You're not being very inclusive, Chris."
April Ludgate,I feel like my input isn't being appreciated.
April Ludgate,You've killed my spirit.
April Ludgate,My spirit blood is on your hands.
Chris Traeger,"My God, I've taught you so much already."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I propose a challenge to see whose motivational methods are more effective."
Ron Swanson,Challenge accepted.
Chris Traeger,"I don't want to seem overdramatic, but this is literally a battle for April's soul."
Ron Swanson,"I don't want to seem overdramatic, but I don't really care what happens here."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,I hate this place.
Tom Haverford,Everything is old.
Tom Haverford,Old things are dumb.
Tom Haverford,"It's like, just be new."
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I think there's some pretty cool things from back then.
Tom Haverford,That is a dope bonnet.
Garth Blunden,"Oh, just getting here, I see."
Leslie Knope,Yikes.
Leslie Knope,Did you sleep here last night?
Garth Blunden,Indeed.
Garth Blunden,I want to be here when the cock crows to get the chores done.
Garth Blunden,"Already, I've done the preserves and chased off an interloping cable installer."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, let's put all modern devices in this pail."
Leslie Knope,Nothing can be used that was invented past 1817.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, Tom, you will be our referees."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for volunteering.
Tom Haverford,Definitely didn't volunteer.
Tom Haverford,I had much better things to do.
Tom Haverford,Leslie said she'd pay me 100 bucks.
Andy Dwyer,And I had nothing better to do.
Andy Dwyer,I'm doing it for free.
Leslie Knope,There's no way I'm losing this contest.
Leslie Knope,Oldtimey dress?
Leslie Knope,Check.
Leslie Knope,Extensive knowledge about early prairie life?
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Leslie Knope,Rickets?
Leslie Knope,Cured.
Leslie Knope,Don't need to worry about rickets.
Leslie Knope,Antiperspirant?
Leslie Knope,Not allowed.
Leslie Knope,Might get a little rough in there.
Ben Wyatt,I was wondering if you could help me out.
Herman,Say no more.
Herman,Here's a bunch of guns.
Ben Wyatt,Nope.
Ben Wyatt,Different thing.
Ben Wyatt,I saw that you recently won an auction for the JJ's diner waffle iron.
Ben Wyatt,And I'd like to that's it right there.
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to buy it.
Ben Wyatt,You and everyone else.
Ann Perkins,"Hello, Ben."
Ann Perkins,Seems like I love Leslie more than you do.
Ann Perkins,Get in line.
Extra,Yeah.
Extra,"Get in line, pal."
Ben Wyatt,Who are you?
Extra,I'm Roz.
Extra,"I'm Leslie's mailwoman, and I need to get her a Mail Day present by next Wednesday."
Extra,It's the anniversary of the first
Ben Wyatt,Time you delivered her mail.
Ann Perkins,Time you delivered her mail.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, we get it."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we get it."
Herman,Looks like we've got ourselves an oldfashioned pawnshop waffle iron bidding war.
Herman,"Let's start the bidding at 650,000 dollars."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll counter with 100 bucks."
Ann Perkins,200
Extra,I'll let you take anything  out of this bag.
Herman,"I'll tell you what, Ann."
Herman,I'll give it to you if you go  on a date with me.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."
Ann Perkins,"I can't believe I'm about to do this, but fine."
Ann Perkins,One date.
Ann Perkins,But let me make one thing perfectly clear
Ben Wyatt,500 bucks.
Herman,Sold.
Ann Perkins,What?
Herman,You still want to go out?
Herman,I just come into some money.
Herman,$500 buys a lot of nitrous.
Garth Blunden,"Yeah, nothing warms the blood like an old whirlybout with the old buttergyre,  eh, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,Indeed.
Leslie Knope,"Man, this guy's tougher than I thought."
Tom Haverford,I don't know how either of you guys are doing this.
Tom Haverford,"One time my refrigerator stopped working, I didn't know what to do."
Tom Haverford,I just moved.
Leslie Knope,I just don't think he's ever gonna quit.
Leslie Knope,He has that look in his eye that Ben gets when he plays Risk.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, wow."
Andy Dwyer,That is really good.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm sorry."
Andy Dwyer,This tastes great.
Andy Dwyer,All my favorite foods have butter on 'em.
Andy Dwyer,"Pancakes, toast, popcorn, grapes."
Andy Dwyer,Butter is my favorite food.
Leslie Knope,"Well, then you're gonna love what I'm churning up."
Leslie Knope,"Take a look at Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is horrifying.
Leslie Knope,Nobody eat that.
Leslie Knope,I think I'm in over my head.
Leslie Knope,Garth really knows his stuff.
Leslie Knope,He planted an entire field of barley.
Leslie Knope,How long is he planning on staying here?
Garth Blunden,"Hey, um, aren't we husband and wife in this scenario?"
Garth Blunden,"I mean, like, shouldn't you"
Leslie Knope,Not a chance.
Garth Blunden,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what's that?"
Leslie Knope,Do you guys feel that?
Leslie Knope,Aah!
Leslie Knope,How long was that under there?
Tom Haverford,"Man, Garth is a machine."
Tom Haverford,He brought his own whale blubber to light the lamps.
Leslie Knope,I thought he was gonna last an hour max.
Leslie Knope,It's like he's getting stronger the longer he stays here.
Garth Blunden,Whee!
Garth Blunden,"Look at my hoop, Leslie."
Garth Blunden,Look at my hoop!
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,Who could live like this?
Leslie Knope,No one.
Leslie Knope,That's why we've moved on.
Leslie Knope,"It's fun to be here on, like, a school field trip or something."
Leslie Knope,"It's so, so, so fun."
Andy Dwyer,"So, so fun."
Leslie Knope,But to live like this is insane.
Leslie Knope,He must have cheated somehow.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's no way a man who's into XMen that much can stay away from the Internet that long."
Leslie Knope,We should check his phone.
Garth Blunden,"Goodness, how delicious  eating goober peas"
Chris Traeger,Jerry Gergich.
Chris Traeger,I need you to stop whatever it is you're doing and file as many of these as you can.
Jerry Gergich,"Wow, Duraflex cuttop A350s in deep maroon?"
Jerry Gergich,The honor is all mine.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I knew you were the man for the job."
Chris Traeger,You are smart and capable.
Chris Traeger,And I believe you can accomplish anything.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Chris Traeger,"You got it, champ."
Chris Traeger,Get filing.
Jerry Gergich,"Aye, aye, Captain."
Chris Traeger,That is one motivated worker bee.
Donna Meagle,You guys doing experiments on Jerry?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Donna Meagle,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, now let's not read anything."
Leslie Knope,That's an invasion of his privacy.
Leslie Knope,Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, he doesn't have any new emails."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,It's true.
Tom Haverford,He hasn't gotten an email in 12 days. Is he a ghost?
Tom Haverford,The only ones he gets are spam.
Tom Haverford,And he responds to them.
Tom Haverford,I think I'm gonna be sick.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man."
Leslie Knope,This guy has no friends.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,Seems like he's friends with that mule.
Ben Wyatt,What's that?
Ann Perkins,"Well, since I can't give her a waffle iron for breakfast day, I am making her a miniature Leslie  out of breakfast food."
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, listen, I've been thinking."
Ben Wyatt,How would you feel about going in  on the waffle iron together?
Ann Perkins,Seriously?
Ann Perkins,"That would be great, but whose holiday are we celebrating?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I think I may have a plan that'll get us out of breakfast day and waffle day and all the other days without making us seem like ungrateful people who are annoyed at how amazing Leslie is."
Ann Perkins,"Dude, whatever it is, I'm in."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, great."
Ann Perkins,What should I do with this?
Ben Wyatt,Just burn it and bury the ashes and pray it doesn't haunt you.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, stop filing those red folders at once."
Ron Swanson,Begin filing these blue ones.
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,I promised Chris that
Ron Swanson,This is the top priority.
Ron Swanson,I need these blue folders done now.
Ron Swanson,You can eat when you have finished.
Ron Swanson,File!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my goodness."
Ron Swanson,"Money, fear, hunger."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there, Garth."
Leslie Knope,Whatcha whittling?
Garth Blunden,A birthing stick.
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Garth Blunden,You do not want to know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Garth Blunden,You look beautiful.
Garth Blunden,"I mean, you changed clothes."
Garth Blunden,Violation.
Garth Blunden,I challenge  you are bonnetless!
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you're right."
Leslie Knope,"I admit, I can't take it anymore."
Leslie Knope,You win.
Garth Blunden,Huzzah!
Garth Blunden,The day is mine.
Garth Blunden,"I'm gonna miss saying ""huzzah."""
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Garth, I have another proposition."
Garth Blunden," Yes, I will go out on a date with you, but I realize you're a modern woman, so I will let you pay."
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission?
Garth Blunden,Those clowns? No thank you.
Garth Blunden, They haven't answered a single one of my complaints about their anachronistic use of fonts in their newsletter.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you."
Leslie Knope," But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such."
Leslie Knope, I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to.
Garth Blunden, Just sounds like such a big bite out of my soap-making time.
Garth Blunden, My cousin's arraignment is in May.
Garth Blunden, But that's a day.
Garth Blunden," I just fly out, I come back the same day."
Garth Blunden," On a trial basis, yes."
Garth Blunden," Yes, yes."
Leslie Knope, Great.
Leslie Knope, Welcome to the team.
Leslie Knope," Garth dropped his protest, and we were able to get rid of all the outdated laws in the town charter."
Leslie Knope," I mean, the charter is a wonderful document, but we've had the benefit of almost 200 years of learning and advancing."
Leslie Knope, Seems to me we ought to use it.
Leslie Knope," I did not change Article Two, though."
Leslie Knope," I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking."
Leslie Knope, Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.
Leslie Knope," From this year hence, a volunteer will represent Ted in our town's most historic and cherished tradition."
Leslie Knope," This year, the honor goes to Mr. Garth Blundin!"
Garth Blunden,"Huzzah, I'm Ted! I'm Ted!"
Andy Dwyer,"I'm Ted too, guys."
Leslie Knope,Andy! 
Leslie Knope,"Yeah! He's naked, everybody! Put that away! "
Andy Dwyer,We're all Ted!
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,"No, Andy!"
Andy Dwyer,Whoo!
Garth Blunden,Thank God.
Garth Blunden, I don't know how to swim.
Donna Meagle," Okay, final tally."
Donna Meagle,Jerry filed 268 red files.
Chris Traeger,Yes!
Donna Meagle,And 384 blue files.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Chris Traeger,Wait a minute.
Chris Traeger, How is that possible?
Donna Meagle,"Well, he was so happy when you told him he was doing a great job that he spent 20 minutes on the phone telling Gayle about it."
Ron Swanson,And the prosecution rests.
Donna Meagle,Not so fast.
Donna Meagle," He may have filed more blue ones, but they're almost all filed wrong."
Donna Meagle, Not surprising since he was a mess after you talked to him.
Chris Traeger," Another fascinating edition of ""katumts."""
Chris Traeger,We may never know conclusively which way works better.
Chris Traeger," But I do know this-- When we first started the seminar, I hoped to be able to engage you in the process."
Chris Traeger, And by that measure I succeeded.
Ron Swanson, And I predicted that I would learn nothing from this process.
Ron Swanson, Mission accomplished.
Chris Traeger, What did April write? Where is April? 
April Ludgate,I will pit Ron and Chris against each other.
April Ludgate," They'll argue about dumb stuff that doesn't matter, and I will bail."
April Ludgate, Then I'll steal $20 from Chris's wallet and buy pizza with Andy.
April Ludgate," Oh, and I'll also steal Ron's watch, just for fun."""
Chris Traeger, I think April will be a fine manager.
Ron Swanson, I agree.
April Ludgate," It's my favorite kind of battle-- Two men enter, one me leaves."
Ben Wyatt,Happy waffle day.
Ann Perkins,Happy breakfast day.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God! You guys, this is the best Breakfast Day/Waffle Day joint present I have ever received."
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, Thank you so much.
Ben Wyatt, You're welcome.
Ben Wyatt, But Ann and I wanted to tell you that this is the last Breakfast Day and Waffle Day we'll be celebrating.
Leslie Knope," Wait, what? Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, You're both dying.
Ann Perkins," No, no."
Ann Perkins, We just can't keep up with all the anniversaries.
Ann Perkins," It's too much, especially 'cause you're so good at them."
Leslie Knope, I'm no better at them than you are.
Leslie Knope," That's ridiculous, I'm so much better."
Leslie Knope, Point taken.
Ben Wyatt, But we have a compromise.
Ben Wyatt," Every year, there will be one day, ""Ann Day,"" where you can celebrate all of Ann's holidays and ""Ben Day"" where we can celebrate all of ours."
Leslie Knope, What about Ann Month and Ben Month?
Ann Perkins,How about a week?
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Ben Wyatt," We went in with a day, figuring she'd counter with a month."
Ann Perkins, We were fine with a week.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Leslie Knope, But there will be a third week.
Leslie Knope, It will be called Friend Week.
Leslie Knope," It will be commemorating this week, the week that my two best friends became each other's best friends."
Leslie Knope, I have a Friend Week present for you right now.
Leslie Knope, Here you go.
Ben Wyatt, How did you already have these?
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.

Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"I didn't find the article about you teaching sex ed to seniors, but I did find this folder labeled  ""Senior sex ed thank you notes."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, don't open that."
Leslie Knope,There's pictures in there.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,There are pictures.
Ben Wyatt,There are lots of pictures.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you not throw these away or incinerate them?
Leslie Knope,Because every memory deserves to be chronicled.
Leslie Knope,Even the saggy ones.
Leslie Knope,I am putting together a scrapbook commemorating my first year on the city council.
Leslie Knope,This year whizzed by so fast.
Leslie Knope,There was so much more I wanted to do.
Leslie Knope,But time is the relentless and cruel enemy of the devoted civil servant.
Leslie Knope,It's actually one of the subtitles of my scrapbook.
Leslie Knope,Probably would've got more stuff done if I hadn't spent so much time brainstorming scrapbook titles.
Ben Wyatt,Ben and Leslie's day off.
Ben Wyatt,Let's go relax.
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait for our day off.
Leslie Knope,But what if we took a day on and stayed here and worked on some projects?
Leslie Knope,"That sounds pretty sexy, right?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, you've worked nonstop."
Ben Wyatt,Holidays and weekends.
Ben Wyatt,You're just gonna take a day off.
Ben Wyatt,It'll be good for you.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,You're cute.
Leslie Knope,And you're right.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Let's relax.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, April."
Leslie Knope,"I'll be gone for the next 19 1/2 hours, so can you water my plants in my office?"
April Ludgate,"We are all out of water, actually."
April Ludgate,I'll have to use boiling hot milk.
Leslie Knope,Are you really gonna do that?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, everybody."
Jerry Gergich,"Um, wow."
Jerry Gergich,It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with you all.
Jerry Gergich,The time I have spent at Parks and Rec have been the happiest days of my life here in the government.
Jerry Gergich,"And I know everyone says it, but I sincerely hope that we stay in touch."
Leslie Knope,What the [Bleep] is happening right now?
Jerry Gergich,"Today's my last day, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,I'm retiring.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell us?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I didn't want to make a big fuss."
Jerry Gergich,"Although, gosh, I'm pretty sure I mentioned it a few times."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, God, they're gonna fire people, aren't they?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I am two years from my pension."
Jerry Gergich,Can you believe it?
Jerry Gergich,Only six months left until I retire.
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
April Ludgate,What did Jerry say?
Tom Haverford,Jerry was here?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, this is my last weep."
Jerry Gergich,Oops.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, ""weep."""
Jerry Gergich,Week.
Jerry Gergich,Jeez.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Leslie Knope,Just wait.
Leslie Knope,Everybody wait.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"As much as we want this to happen, we can't let Jerry just disappear."
Leslie Knope,We have to commemorate this somehow.
Ron Swanson,You're right.
Ron Swanson,"Jerry, thank you for your service."
Ron Swanson,Goodbye.
Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,That speech means a lot.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, I am going to go and say goodbye to some other folks."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, see you tomorrow, Jerry."
Extra,"So we ran all your tests, and everything looks great."
Extra,You might be the healthiest human being we've ever seen.
Extra,You have the resting heart rate of a 100 year old tortoise.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, I get that a lot."
Chris Traeger,So my childhood illness there's no chance I would pass that on?
Extra,"It wasn't genetic, so you shouldn't worry at all."
Extra,You have every reason to expect a healthy child.
Extra,"In fact, if you'd like, you can provide your sample today."
Ann Perkins,Today?
Ann Perkins,"Like, today, today?"
Chris Traeger,This today?
Extra,"Well, yes."
Extra,"I mean, the timing is right according to Ann's ovulation schedule."
Extra,Unless there's a reason you'd like to wait till next month.
Ann Perkins,No.
Chris Traeger,None.
Chris Traeger,One other question.
Chris Traeger,Completely off topic.
Chris Traeger,Would I be providing this sample today?
Leslie Knope,"Here I am thinking about how fast my first year in city council has gone, and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past him with nothing to show for it."
Leslie Knope,"This is everything in his file a handicapped parking sticker from when he got gout, a Parks and Rec golf cart driving exam which he failed, a scathing performance review."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, why would anyone be so mean?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wait."
Leslie Knope,I wrote this.
Leslie Knope,I stand by it.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, Jerry was never really the type to rise above mediocrity or to it."
Leslie Knope,"That's what I thought, but when he started, he had a lot of dreams and goals."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at his original entry paperwork."
Leslie Knope,"He wanted to meet the mayor, have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,I just can't let Jerry leave here with nothing and go home to an empty life.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'll help with anything."
Ben Wyatt,Just promise we'll do it quickly.
Ben Wyatt,I'm making us a mac and cheese pizza for
Leslie Knope,Mac and cheese pizza?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,You're making that?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Torturing Jerry was my favorite thing in the world.
April Ludgate,After making out with you.
Andy Dwyer,Remember when we did both at the same time?
Andy Dwyer,It made him so uncomfortable.
Tom Haverford,This is a sad day.
Tom Haverford,Who are we gonna make fun of now?
Ron Swanson,No need to worry.
Ron Swanson,"Every place I've ever worked in has had a ""Jerry."""
Ron Swanson,"When one Jerry leaves, the office naturally selects a new Jerry to fill that role."
Ron Swanson,It's Social Darwinism.
Ron Swanson,The strong prey on the weak.
Ron Swanson,"Soon, one of you will be ridiculed mercilessly."
Ron Swanson,"Ah, nature."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,My transfer was approved.
Ann Perkins,"So starting now, I am an employee of the County Health Board."
Ann Perkins,"You are no longer my boss, and we can have a baby without being a conflict of interest."
Ann Perkins,Clear sailing.
Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins, my excellent employee."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, Ann Perkins, my fallopian princess."
Extra,So here's the drill.
Extra,Make a deposit in here.
Extra,"If you fill it up all the way, you get on the board."
Extra,"Then we take the sample, spin it in the centrifuge, and prepare it for fertilization."
Chris Traeger,Sounds romantic.
Chris Traeger,I guess it's go time.
Ann Perkins,Go time!
Ann Perkins,"Wait, what am I doing?"
Ann Perkins,I don't go with you.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no."
Chris Traeger,I go in alone with this pornographic disc and do it myself.
Chris Traeger,And you stay out here and try not to think about what I'm doing in there.
Chris Traeger,And I try not to think about you waiting out here trying not to think about me.
Chris Traeger,Should I think about you?
Chris Traeger,This is so weird.
Ann Perkins,"Chris, we don't have to do this today."
Ann Perkins,This was totally just sprung on us.
Ann Perkins,Let's just take a moment.
Ann Perkins,There's so many pamphlets to look at.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we do have very important pamphlet reading to do."
Chris Traeger,"Excellent idea, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,Do I keep this?
Ann Perkins,I don't know.
Ann Perkins,It feels wrong to leave it here.
Ann Perkins,Give it to me.
Ann Perkins,I panicked.
Ann Perkins,Run!
Tom Haverford,Here are the last of the Animal Control reports.
April Ludgate,"What are you doing, weirdo?"
Tom Haverford,Just trying not to spill anything.
Ron Swanson,I believe Leslie said to organize these by year.
Tom Haverford,Way ahead of you.
Tom Haverford,I made two pile files.
Tom Haverford,Pilo fibles.
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,Filo pilos.
Andy Dwyer,Filo pilos?
Andy Dwyer,That's not right.
Donna Meagle,Are you broken?
Tom Haverford,"No, everything's fine."
April Ludgate,"Well, I guess that settles who the new Jerry is."
Tom Haverford,"No, it doesn't!"
Tom Haverford,I barely even said it wrong.
Andy Dwyer,Said it wrong.
Tom Haverford,Stop it!
Tom Haverford,This is how it begins.
Tom Haverford,"The next ""Jerry."""
Tom Haverford,"One screwed-up sentence, and 30 years later, I'm wearing aquamarine sweater vests and listening to Bonnie Raitt and The da Vinci Code on my iPod."
Tom Haverford,It's already started.
Leslie Knope,"Believe it or not, Jerry, you were young once."
Leslie Knope,Young and full of dreams.
Jerry Gergich,I forgot I wrote all this.
Leslie Knope,"And as unrealistic and absurd as those goals were, we are not letting you retire until we help you achieve them."
Leslie Knope,So let's see what's first.
Leslie Knope,"""Eat in city council private dining room."""
Leslie Knope,That we can achieve.
Jerry Gergich,Right now?
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Extra,Authorized personnel only.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, they're with me."
Leslie Knope,"City Councilor Leslie Knope, clearance level four."
Extra,Guests are only allowed on Wednesdays.
Extra,And we don't have clearance levels.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but shouldn't we?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it sounds so cool."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, we just need to get in there real quick and maybe take a picture."
Leslie Knope,"He's retiring as a city hall employee after 41 years, and it was his dream to eat here."
Extra,His dream?
Extra,Really?
Extra,Still no.
Jerry Gergich,"It's okay, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,Come on.
Jerry Gergich,But thank you.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you for trying.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,I promised you an executive meal and you're gonna get one.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, just okay."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go in there and take a picture with Jerry.
Leslie Knope,I put my arm around nothing.
Leslie Knope,"And then you Photoshop him in later, okay?"
Extra,Congratulations on your retirement.
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, thank you."
Andy Dwyer,"One, three, seven, two, five, nine."
Andy Dwyer,Pffft!
Andy Dwyer,Sudoku is easy.
Andy Dwyer,Is there even rules to this game?
Tom Haverford,"There's a natural successor to Jerry's sad, smelly crown."
Tom Haverford,And it's not me.
Tom Haverford,It's Andy.
Tom Haverford,Big guy?
Tom Haverford,Check.
Tom Haverford,Goofy?
Tom Haverford,Check.
Tom Haverford,"All I have to do is wait for a textbook Dwyer screwup, which usually happens, mm, every 20 minutes."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, if it isn't Filo Pilo."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, real creative, Donna."
Tom Haverford,You expect that to catch on?
April Ludgate,"Babe, the pen."
Tom Haverford,Look at Andy.
Tom Haverford,There's ink all over him.
Tom Haverford,Andy's the new Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Game over.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I'm like a giant squid."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, honey, I'm ink Dracula."
April Ludgate,"No, stop."
Andy Dwyer,Squid Dracula is going to get you.
Donna Meagle,"Barking up the wrong tree, Filo."
Tom Haverford,What do you mean?
Donna Meagle,Andy will never be the new Jerry.
Donna Meagle,Nothing embarrasses him.
Donna Meagle,He's like a giant puppy with no shame.
Donna Meagle,What you need is some fresh meat in the office.
Tom Haverford,Or you guys could just stop making fun of me.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, on to the next Jerry goal meet Mayor Knudson."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,He was the mayor at the time.
Jerry Gergich,I've always wanted to meet him.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, today you're getting that chance."
Ben Wyatt,So was he like  a really great mayor?
Leslie Knope,"No, not really."
Leslie Knope,"He resigned because of corruption and racketeering, and then he died from an overdose of pills."
Leslie Knope,But actually his real cause of death was being thrown out of a helicopter while handcuffed.
Leslie Knope,"Some people say he's still alive because they never found the body, but they never found the body because he exploded on impact."
Ben Wyatt,Sounds like a good dude.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"I just wish I had a chance to meet him, you know, years ago before all the scandals and his death."
Jerry Gergich,But this is nice too.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Is it?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, go over there."
Leslie Knope,Let's meet Mayor Knudson.
Leslie Knope,I'll take your picture.
Jerry Gergich,Butterflies.
Jerry Gergich,"Hello, Mr. Mayor."
Jerry Gergich,"First of all, I'm so sorry that those Serbian mobsters shoved you out of that helicopter."
Jerry Gergich,You deserve better.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you tried, but I took a day off to spend with you, not with you and Jerry and a dead mayor."
Ben Wyatt,Can we please just call it a day?
Leslie Knope,"No, we can't because in a few short years, we're gonna be visiting Jerry here, and he will have achieved nothing."
Leslie Knope,Is that what you want?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, then."
Jerry Gergich,It's really been nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Jerry, let's go."
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,Ronfire of the vanities.
Ron Swanson,Filo Pilo.
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding me?
Tom Haverford,"Listen, now that Jerry's gone, we need to hire someone to pick up the slack."
Ron Swanson,A new person in the office?
Tom Haverford,Not a person.
Tom Haverford,An intern.
Ron Swanson,Why on earth would I get an intern?
Tom Haverford,Interns cost nothing to the taxpayer.
Tom Haverford,"And more importantly, they're usually stupid and terrible."
Tom Haverford,So they get no work done.
Tom Haverford,It's like a Jerry you don't have to pay.
Ron Swanson,"Damn, son."
Ron Swanson,That is one compelling argument.
Ron Swanson,"Keep it up, Filo."
Ron Swanson,We may destroy this government one day after all.
Chris Traeger,These pamphlets are fascinating.
Chris Traeger,"It says here that some men gain ""sympathy weight"" when their partners get pregnant."
Chris Traeger,"If that happens to me, I'd be miserable."
Chris Traeger,But happy.
Chris Traeger,But sad.
Ann Perkins,I would have never imagined the babymaking process to be this clinical.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, imagine if actual sex were like this."
Chris Traeger,Let me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our genes.
Chris Traeger,And it's also weird because we dated and we remember what it's like to engage in some of those  physical activities.
Ann Perkins,Exactly.
Ann Perkins,And we were also pretty good at those physical activities.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were."
Chris Traeger,"Yes, we were."
Ann Perkins,"You know, is this all the pamphlets?"
Ann Perkins,'Cause I think that maybe I have some left in my bedroom.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, well, then, we should definitely go look for those."
Ann Perkins,Let's find those.
Chris Traeger,We need to find those.
Ann Perkins,Hurry.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone gather around."
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I really appreciate this, but I did promise Gayle I would leave by 5:00."
Jerry Gergich,"She has a tasty surprise waiting for me, if you know what I mean."
April Ludgate,"Gross, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,She made a meatloaf.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is better than meatloaf."
Leslie Knope,"When Jerry first applied for this job, one of this goals was to have a building named after him."
Leslie Knope,"Again, that is an absurd request considering your work record."
Leslie Knope,But I thought maybe he could have a room named after him.
Leslie Knope,"So henceforth, Parks and Rec conference room will serve as a testament to your years of public service."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"Hear, hear."
Jerry Gergich,"""Jerry Gergich Memorial Conference Room. R.I.P.""?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, the guy at the plaque store thought you had died."
Ben Wyatt,"It was a rush job, so we didn't have time to change it."
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope,We can just pretend it means retire in peace.
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,So bring out the cake!
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Speech, speech, speech."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, thank you, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm not much of a speechmaker, but I do like good cake."
Jerry Gergich,Delicious.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, you're on fire."
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Jerry!"
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that went roughly as well as I thought it would."
Jerry Gergich,I promised Gayle I'd leave at 5:00.
Jerry Gergich,I guess this is it.
Jerry Gergich,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,"See you tomorrow, Jeremy."
Tom Haverford,"Well, pretty heroic, huh, guys?"
Tom Haverford,Hard to make fun of that.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, the cake."
Andy Dwyer,Filo Pilo ruined the cake.
April Ludgate,Classic Pilo.
Tom Haverford,What how is that my fault?
Tom Haverford,Stupid Jerry.
Tom Haverford,Should have never saved his life.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a second?
Jerry Gergich,Leslie.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, this is a lovely surprise."
Jerry Gergich,Come on in.
Jerry Gergich,Have breakfast with the family.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,I just popped by to apologize and to give you something.
Gayle Gergich,Is that Leslie Knope?
Jerry Gergich,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi, Gayle."
Gayle Gergich,What a surprise.
Gayle Gergich,I insist you join us for breakfast.
Gayle Gergich,This guy is the greatest breakfast chef in the world.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm not really into breakfast foods."
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Your purse is shaped like a waffle.
Leslie Knope,Is it?
Gayle Gergich,Please join us.
Gayle Gergich,The Gergiches don't take no for an answer.
Jerry Gergich,Mmmm.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, okay."
Leslie Knope,Come on in.
Jerry Gergich,"Girls, we've got company."
Donna Meagle,"So, you want to get out of here?"
Extra,"Work just started, Ms. Meagle."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, but our work is just beginning."
Donna Meagle,You know what I'm saying?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, Donna, who's the new boy toy?"
Extra,"I'm Taylor, the new intern."
Tom Haverford,This is the new intern?
Tom Haverford,Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, he went to high school with my sister, Natalie."
April Ludgate,He was a big deal on the football team.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, meathead jock type, huh?"
Extra,"Actually, I quit football senior year so I could help my pastor run a homeless shelter."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Pfftt!
Tom Haverford,"This guy loves the homeless so much, he should marry them, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Anybody would be lucky to marry him.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Taylor, do you want to marry me and April?"
Extra,"Wish I could, man, but I'm not a ""marriage"" dude."
Extra,"I've got a lot of love to give, and it just seems unfair to put boundaries on it."
Donna Meagle,He gets it.
Donna Meagle,You so get it.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey."
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Chris Traeger,Should I keep walking towards you?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I could stop, and you could walk."
Ann Perkins,"Or you know what, we could meet in the middle."
Chris Traeger,Great plan.
Ann Perkins,Hello.
Chris Traeger,Hi.
Ann Perkins,Welp.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, ask me if I'm sad."
Ron Swanson,No.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, I'm the new Jerry."
Ron Swanson,"Well, is whining going to do anything about it?"
Ron Swanson,You don't want to be a whipping boy.
Ron Swanson,Stand up for yourself.
Tom Haverford,"You don't understand, Ron."
Tom Haverford,I already was Jerry.
Tom Haverford,"I was a skinny Indian kid in South Carolina, and it sucked."
Tom Haverford,"It took me 12 years, but I reinvented myself."
Tom Haverford,I'm a business owner.
Tom Haverford,I wear dope suits.
Tom Haverford,I have fur underwear.
Tom Haverford,It was all for nothing.
Tom Haverford,I'm back to being a Jerry.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I gotta buy some sweat pants and a Nicholas Sparks novel.
Tom Haverford,Might as well lean into it.
Ron Swanson,Tom can take care of himself.
Ron Swanson,He's a grown man.
Ron Swanson,"Well, half grown."
Ron Swanson,He does have a business where he rents out his clothes to 12 year olds.
Jerry Gergich,"Eggs, bacon, and toast  eggs, bacon, and toast  why don't you start your day   the Gergich way with eggs, bacon, and "
Leslie Knope,"Oh, me?"
Leslie Knope,toast.
Jerry Gergich,"eggs, bacon, and toast  eggs, bacon, and toast  why don't you start your day   the Gergich way with  eggs, bacon, and  Toast"
Jerry Gergich,Very good.
Millicent Gergich,We sing that every morning.
Gayle Gergich,But it's an extra treat because you're here to sing it with us.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, I wanted your last day at work to be special, and I feel like I let you down."
Jerry Gergich, No!
Leslie Knope,So I made you this scrapbook with nearly 4 amazing pages jam-packed with memories of your time in the government.
Jerry Gergich," Oh, my god well, look."
Gayle Gergich," Oh, honey."
Gayle Gergich, You look great in every one of these.
Gayle Gergich, You are still the most handsome man in the world to me.
Millicent Gergich, Ugh.
Millicent Gergich," Mom, come on."
Millicent Gergich," Yeah, jeez, mom."
Millicent Gergich, We're eating.
Leslie Knope," You know, it doesn't make any sense."
Jerry Gergich," Leslie, that is really sweet of you, but you don't have to worry about me."
Jerry Gergich, I'm great.
Jerry Gergich, Here.
Jerry Gergich, I want to show you something.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Jerry Gergich," No! You also dropped that, clumsy."
Leslie Knope, Where am I?
Jerry Gergich,"I know I didn't achieve all my work goals, but, Leslie, I don't care because for me, the best part about working in the Parks department was that I got to be home every night with my family at 5:00."
Jerry Gergich," And to me, that's what mattered most."
Jerry Gergich, Little Sebastian
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Leslie Knope, Jerry.
Leslie Knope, Thank you for sharing this with me.
Leslie Knope, I-- You have a wonderful life.
Jerry Gergich, Mmhmm.
Jerry Gergich, Aw.
Millicent Gergich, Group hug.
Jerry Gergich," Uhoh, here they are."
Jerry Gergich, The hug machine is here.
Jerry Gergich, The hug machine-- it's firing on all cylinders.
Ann Perkins," Okay, I think we should be adults and talk about this."
Chris Traeger, I would love to.
Ann Perkins, I was nervous after yesterday because I was thinking what does this mean for us?
Ann Perkins,"Not as parents, but as Chris and Ann? I don't think on-again, off-again is a great parental model."
Chris Traeger," Well, I completely agree."
Ann Perkins," But if there is a hypothetical chance that we could provide a home with two parents who are hypothetically together, then that could be even better hypothetically."
Chris Traeger, Of course.
Chris Traeger, We should discuss and consider all the possibilities.
Chris Traeger, The most important thing for me and I think for you is that we have a child.
Chris Traeger, And I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.
Ann Perkins, Do you want to make out?
Chris Traeger,I really do.
Jerry Gergich, Hey.
April Ludgate," What are you doing here, Jerry? I thought you were fired."
Jerry Gergich, I wasn't fired.
Jerry Gergich, I retired.
Andy Dwyer, That's what they all say.
Ron Swanson, I asked Jerry to come in.
Ron Swanson," That new intern wasn't working out, so I got rid of him."
Donna Meagle," Once again, I object in the strongest possible terms."
Ron Swanson," Once again, noted."
Ron Swanson, I have also asked Jerry to come in a couple hours a week until we find a permanent replacement.
April Ludgate," Ugh, just when we were rid of him?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I don't know, Ron."
Ron Swanson," Are you hearing me, son? Jerry will come in once a week, and everyone will get to watch him eat and talk to him about anything he might do or say or fart."
Tom Haverford,"Welcome back, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich," Oh, it feels good just to be "
Andy Dwyer,Classic new guy.
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry that I spent your day off with Jerry instead of relaxing with you.
Ben Wyatt,It's all right.
Ben Wyatt," And after you fell asleep making Jerry's scrapbook, I went back to season one of Fringe to check for plot holes."
Ben Wyatt," As I suspected, airtight."
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope, This is all my fault.
Leslie Knope, I love my job.
Leslie Knope," But in the blink of an eye, I'm gonna be retiring, you know, and flying off on Marine One with you and a Secret Service detail."
Leslie Knope," Achievements are great, but I want more than that."
Leslie Knope, I want what Jerry has.
Leslie Knope," I mean, we're always gonna work, but I think we need to fill this scrapbook too."
Leslie Knope, Maybe we should take a real day off and talk about starting our family.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Ben Wyatt, That sounds perfect.
Ben Wyatt," Hey, while you were over at Jerry's, did you happen to get any information about his history with Gayle?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, was she a Russian spy and the KGB forced her to marry Jerry as a cover?"
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a mystery, Ben."
Leslie Knope, Let it go.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, I can't."
Ben Wyatt, It keeps me awake at night.
Ben Wyatt," Hey, maybe Gayle has one of those Oliver Sacks brain disorder thingies?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, does she think Jerry is a friendly hat?"
Leslie Knope,I think you solved it.

Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,What the hell is this?
Ron Swanson,I'm guessing it's my latest budget cut proposal based on your rage sweat.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I am rage glowing."
Leslie Knope,"Second, you wanna cut funding for the Pawnee Palms Public PuttPutt?"
Leslie Knope,What did the P.P.P.P.P. ever do to you?
Leslie Knope,"Ron is very antigovernment, and he has that philosophy, but there are just certain things that you don't cut."
Leslie Knope,"Schools, police, minigolf, merrygorounds, parades, gazebo repair, roads and bridges, whatever."
Leslie Knope,"Pretty gardens, hummingbird feeders."
Ron Swanson,I believe in cutting useless government projects.
Ron Swanson,"I also believe in cutting useful projects, future projects, and past projects."
Ron Swanson,The Hoover Dam is a travesty.
Leslie Knope,You also believe in making furniture.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you go solder a chair instead?
Ron Swanson,Do you expect me to make a chair out of transistor chips and small wires?
Ron Swanson,"Look, the defunding of the minigolf course is on the agenda for the city council meeting tomorrow."
Ron Swanson,I'm sure you'll argue against it with your trademark vigor.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I will argue, and I'm gonna win."
Leslie Knope,"That puttputt is gonna be around forever, and when I am done with it, it'll attract more visitors than the Hoover Dam."
Leslie Knope,And it'll produce double the amount of electricity.
Ron Swanson,How?
Leslie Knope,I'll figure it out.
Leslie Knope,It already has windmills.
Leslie Knope,Who cares?
Leslie Knope,"Councilmen, I have something to discuss with you, but before I do, can I just point out how handsome the both of you look today?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I know."
Councilman Milton,I feel very ill.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, tomorrow we are voting on funding for the minigolf course, and personally, I think it is great for families, it's a great job creator, and it's extremely cute."
Leslie Knope,I'm wondering which way you two are leaning.
Councilman Milton,"Well, the last time I was there, I saw kids of all races getting along and playing."
Councilman Milton,It was terrible.
Councilman Milton,So I'm voting to get rid of it.
Leslie Knope,At least you have a good reason.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Howser is with me."
Leslie Knope,Milton is with Dexhart.
Leslie Knope,"Jeremy, you're the swing vote."
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, on the one hand, I love cutting government programs."
Jeremy Jamm,"On the other hand, minigolf rules."
Jeremy Jamm,"And on the third hand, I hate both you and Ron Swanson."
Jeremy Jamm,So this one could go either way.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm kind of a badass wild card.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?"
Jeremy Jamm,More like who am I doing?
Jeremy Jamm,No one.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm free.
Jeremy Jamm,What's up?
Andy Dwyer,"Can I get two beers and an ice water for my friend here, designated driver?"
Ben Wyatt,I am?
Ben Wyatt,You drove here.
Andy Dwyer,"Nah, it's too late, bro."
Andy Dwyer,I already ordered the water.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what you want me to do.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I just closed a big donation to the Redwood Music Program, a charity he discovered, so I suggested we all go out for a celebratory drink."
Ben Wyatt,And somehow I just ended up becoming the designated driver.
Ben Wyatt,And paying for everyone.
Ben Wyatt,And I didn't get to choose the bar.
Ben Wyatt,I should be more assertive.
Andy Dwyer,"Aw, the band is moving me tonight."
Andy Dwyer,It's really good.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,They sound kinda crappy to me.
April Ludgate,"Kinda sounds like one of your songs, babe."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, you know what, Mouse Rat has a lot of influence on some of the local high school bands, mostly 'cause Chang buys 'em beer and whatnot."
April Ludgate,"Wait, Andy, this is a Mouse Rat song."
Burly,"Spread your wings and fly, yeah"
Andy Dwyer,That's my band.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't recognize us without me because I'm the only one that matters.
Burly,"Thank you, everyone."
Burly,We are Rat Mouse.
Andy Dwyer,Rat Mouse?
Andy Dwyer,Rat bastards.
Andy Dwyer,They're playing without me?
Andy Dwyer,That's a song I wrote!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, baby, can I borrow your car for a month?"
Tom Haverford,I already lent you my car.
Tom Haverford,Do you not know where my car is?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ugh, I'm so sick of the third degree."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's like dating a cop.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm gassy.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Let's make out.
Tom Haverford,What?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Yeah.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Move aside!
Tom Haverford,Dating MonaLisa is awesome.
Tom Haverford,Except that I live in constant fear for my life.
Tom Haverford,So I guess it's time to do the mature thing and have someone else dump her for me.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, Perkins, sit down."
Tom Haverford,I just heard that you and Traeger might be getting back together.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, it's funny, right?"
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we're already planning on having a baby together."
Ann Perkins,We're not quite a couple but
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Cool.
Tom Haverford,Congrats.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, I need your help."
Tom Haverford,My girlfriend is crazy.
Ann Perkins,You say that about every girl you date.
Ann Perkins,You said that about me.
Tom Haverford,"Calm down, Ann."
Tom Haverford,You're proving my point.
Tom Haverford,"Seriously, MonaLisa is legit insane."
Tom Haverford,She once jumped out of a moving car to buy a Nicki Minaj poster.
Tom Haverford,Can you break up with her for me?
Ann Perkins,I'm not gonna dump a girl for you.
Tom Haverford,I'll give you that chenille blanket of mine  you love so much.
Ann Perkins,Deal.
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, but that's my favorite blankie."
Tom Haverford,Won't you do it for free?
Ann Perkins,Nope.
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, dead ringer for Courtney ThorneSmith."
Jeremy Jamm,She works at the gas station.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to have Jamm fall in love with this place, so I'm rolling out the red carpet."
Leslie Knope,I need you to stay upbeat.
Leslie Knope,Keep things light.
Chris Traeger,Absolutely.
Chris Traeger,I can be a sort of Conversational lubricant.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, there's probably a less gross way to say it, but sure."
Chris Traeger,I love being a caddy.
Chris Traeger,It's so much more than just carrying clubs.
Chris Traeger,It's about offering positive reinforcement.
Chris Traeger,I consider myself a caddy to everyone in my life.
Extra,"Yeah, good one!"
Chris Traeger,Nice shot!
Chris Traeger,Great sweeping.
Chris Traeger,"Way to be, duck."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman, nice putter."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, thank you very much."
Jeremy Jamm,Some fat Hawaiian guy left it in my waiting room.
Jeremy Jamm,"When he came back, I was all like, ""Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, no, I haven't seen it."""
Jeremy Jamm,I don't know.
Jeremy Jamm,Classic.
Leslie Knope,What a great and funny story.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, before we start, anybody want a hot dog?"
Jeremy Jamm,Hot dogs?
Jeremy Jamm,"You know I have irritable bowel syndrome, you racist."
Leslie Knope,"Yikes, okay."
Leslie Knope,How about a snow cone on me?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Councilman."
Ron Swanson,"Chris, Leslie, snow cone lady."
Ron Swanson,I see you're about to play a round of publicly subsidized minigolf.
Ron Swanson,Mind if I join you?
Andy Dwyer,"Well, hello, Burly, Chang."
Burly,"Hey, man, what's up?"
Andy Dwyer,"I was just over at the bar, enjoying a wonderful night with my coworkers who all talked about how awesome I was, and I look up, and what do I see?"
Andy Dwyer,A band.
Andy Dwyer,"But you're missing something like, uh, I don't know, your lead singer songwriter  Tshirt designer nacho chef."
Andy Dwyer,What's up?
Burly,"First of all, your nachos are terrible."
Burly,No one's had the guts to tell you.
Burly,Why don't you melt the cheese?
Chang,"We tried to tell you about the show, man."
Chang,"I called your cell, like, 20 times."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I dropped my cell phone in a bowl of cereal last week, you idiot."
Andy Dwyer,"You bothered to call me, you'd have known that."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you should change your name to Burly and The Backstabbers.
Burly,"That's a pretty good name, actually."
Chang,"Yeah, he's really good at coming up with names."
Jeremy Jamm,Get me a Budweiser Black Crown.
Jeremy Jamm,You guys got Black Crown here?
Jeremy Jamm,"If not, you should."
Chris Traeger,"Ron, are you gonna be joining us?"
Ron Swanson,I won't be playing.
Ron Swanson,I'm simply here to remind Councilman Jamm that this ridiculous play palace costs the taxpayers thousands of dollars a year.
Leslie Knope,And what a bargain.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, kids love it, adults love it, Jamm loves it."
Leslie Knope,Everybody loves it.
Leslie Knope,It's like the Toy Story 3 of places.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, she's right, Swanson."
Jeremy Jamm,I do love it.
Jeremy Jamm,You should relax a little.
Jeremy Jamm,Have a snow cone.
Jeremy Jamm,Leslie's buying all night.
Ron Swanson,You don't say.
Ron Swanson,"She's buying you snow cones, and tomorrow you're voting on an issue that she cares about."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, what, are we gonna stand around all day and listen to Ron spout off unrelated facts about blah, blah, blah, or are we gonna play?"
Leslie Knope,Game on.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, everybody, great news."
Chris Traeger,They gave us free mylar balloons.
Jeremy Jamm,I got dibs on the dinosaur.
Jeremy Jamm,And the pirate and the dolphin.
Jeremy Jamm,I want all of 'em.
Leslie Knope,You got 'em.
Jeremy Jamm,Sweet.
Chris Traeger,The Councilman is away Good luck to you both.
Jeremy Jamm,"Luck has nothing to do with it, Chris."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I could be a pro!"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, you are on fire, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,Having fun?
Jeremy Jamm,Mmhmm.
Leslie Knope,I think this proves that this is a wonderful place that brings joy to people's lives and brings a community together.
Ron Swanson,"It's also a place that costs the taxpayer 9,000 dollars in annual subsidies."
Jeremy Jamm,You guys sound like school.
Chris Traeger,I have two important pieces of caddy information.
Chris Traeger,"Councilman Jamm leads by eight strokes, and you are both about to set a course record."
Chris Traeger,For friendship.
Chris Traeger,On to the next hole.
Ron Swanson,You are pandering to get a vote.
Ron Swanson,"And worse, you're deliberately losing."
Leslie Knope,I am not deliberately losing.
Leslie Knope,I'm having a very off night.
Ron Swanson,Losing on purpose is a form of lying.
Ron Swanson,You're only as good as your word.
Leslie Knope,"You want a word, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,I have a word for you.
Leslie Knope,"I will do anything I can to get Jamm's vote so that he will keep this course open, and it will be good for the community stop!"
Leslie Knope,I know it's more than one word.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.

Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, okay."

Ann Perkins,"Is that a screwdrive no, I do not want to fight."
Ann Perkins,No.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I just wanna talk to you woman to woman because I know Tom pretty well.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Do you know his ATM pin?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,'Cause I cannot crack that little bitch's code.
Ann Perkins,I don't.
Ann Perkins,You know what used to drive me nuts?
Ann Perkins,He is a total control freak.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, you have to put a coaster down on every surface, and the worst part is, they're all made out of pictures from Diddy's Instagram."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Diddy's on Instagram?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"How did I not know that Diddy was on Instagram, you jagweeds?"
Ann Perkins,Who are you yelling at?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,The jagweeds.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Why are you still in front of me?
Burly,Everything that used to

Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I'm an adult now, you know?"
Andy Dwyer,I work two parttime jobs.
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,I don't need the stress of playing guitar with my friends every few weeks.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, plus look how bad they are without you."
April Ludgate,Burly's terrible.
Andy Dwyer,He actually has a really beautiful voice for a backup singer.
April Ludgate,"Right, that's what I meant."
April Ludgate,"I love Andy, but to be perfectly honest, Mouse Rat's music is not my thing."
April Ludgate,"I really only listen to, like, German Death Reggae and Halloween sound effects records from the 1950s."
April Ludgate,And Bette Midler.
April Ludgate,Obviously.
Andy Dwyer,"You know what, I'm retiring from music."
April Ludgate,Andy.
April Ludgate,Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,"But not without first a monster farewell performance solo on this stage tonight, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,I'ma show these idiots what a big mistake they made.
Andy Dwyer,"I need piece of paper, I need a pen, I need four more beers, I need a computer fan, I need a lightning bolt of inspiration."
Andy Dwyer,It's song writing time.
Ben Wyatt,What do you need a computer fan for?
Andy Dwyer,"Sometimes when you use a computer, it gets hot, and the fan cools it down."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I think it's great that you're cool with Tom's financial situation."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What are you talking about?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Tommy owns his own business.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, but he had to borrow a lot of money, and when you're not around, Tom drinks tap water."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,What?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Excuse me.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,You're broke?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yeah, super broke."
Tom Haverford,Are you upset about that?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Mm, yeah, 'cause I don't eff with poorsies."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"But thanks to a warning from my new best friend, I don't have to, okay?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"We're done, you're awesome, and I don't even usually like Puerto Rican chicks."
Ann Perkins,"I'm not I mean, it shouldn't matter, but I'm"
Tom Haverford,You're breaking up with me?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, man, that sucks."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,That's right.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's over.

Ann Perkins,Help.
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, I cannot catch a break."
Jeremy Jamm,"You better find your stroke, Knope."
Chris Traeger,"Guys, I'm gonna let Julie go home."
Chris Traeger,"It's getting late, and Jeremy's eaten all the syrup."
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,It's been an honor working alongside you.
Extra,Thanks.
Jeremy Jamm,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Jeremy Jamm,Hold up.
Jeremy Jamm,Snow cones are half the fun.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Julie, could you stay, please?"
Extra,I have calculus homework.
Leslie Knope,"I Oh, well, math is worthless in real life."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's an app for calculating tips."
Leslie Knope,That's all you need.
Leslie Knope,"Math is very important, especially for young women."
Leslie Knope,Stay in school.
Ron Swanson,I've made my point.
Ron Swanson,Leslie has made hers.
Ron Swanson,"Which way are you voting, Councilman?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, well, I'm kind of still on the fence about this budget thing, but I do love watching you guys squabble over me."
Jeremy Jamm,You sure make a guy feel like a real lady.
Leslie Knope,Weird.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, how about this?"
Jeremy Jamm,You two play each other.
Jeremy Jamm,Nine holes.
Jeremy Jamm,Winner gets my vote.
Leslie Knope,I'm game.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Ron Swanson,An athletic competition where both parties are competing their hardest is certainly more honorable than whatever this charade is.
Chris Traeger,Sudden death playoff on the very course that hangs in the balance.
Chris Traeger,I could literally faint if I didn't have impeccable blood pressure.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, everybody."
Andy Dwyer,My name is Andy Dwyer.
Andy Dwyer,You probably know me as the artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, after tonight, you'll only know me as the former artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat."
Andy Dwyer,I'm retiring from music.
Andy Dwyer,This is my swan song.
Andy Dwyer,Once I was a golden swan swan of a man now that swan's name was Andy and he started a rock and roll band  
Andy Dwyer,he made incredible nachos that everybody claimed they loved and then the band mates dicked him over 
Andy Dwyer,with a massive rock and roll shove this is my swan song  watch me fly
Ann Perkins,Tom.
Tom Haverford,What happened to you?
Ann Perkins,MonaLisa happened to me.
Ann Perkins,She covered me in glitter and Anna Nicole body spray.
Ann Perkins,Why do they still even make that?
Tom Haverford,They don't she's had the same bottle for years.
Tom Haverford,She just mixes in water and baby oil.
Ann Perkins,"Now it's your turn to help me, okay?"
Ann Perkins,You need to break things off with me and MonaLisa.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, Ann, this might be a battle you need to fight yourself."
Tom Haverford,I try not to get involved in other people's personal relationships.
Tom Haverford,Aah!
Tom Haverford,Don't hurt me.
Ann Perkins,Get me out of this friendship!
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna find a place where I can be the beautiful duckling I always was inside whoa  whoa whoa
Ron Swanson,Why is there a gorilla guarding this gingerbread house?
Leslie Knope,Because minigolf is awesome.
Leslie Knope,"It's cute, and it's fun, and it needs to be saved."
Jeremy Jamm,Less talk.
Jeremy Jamm,More competing for my vote.
Jeremy Jamm,Wow.
Chris Traeger,This is it.
Chris Traeger,Ron leads by one.
Chris Traeger,"If he hits the ball into the dragon's mouth, he gets Jamm's vote."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, bean sprouts."
Leslie Knope,Tofu.

Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Chris Traeger,Hole in one!
Chris Traeger,"Excellent win, Ron."
Chris Traeger,"Even better loss, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,"Ultimately, we learn the most about ourselves through the losses."
Jeremy Jamm,"Swanson, I hate you."
Jeremy Jamm,Nothing will change that.
Jeremy Jamm,But I respect the hell out of your short game.
Jeremy Jamm,"You got my vote, hombre."
Extra,"Hey, you got a hole in one on 18, so I'm supposed to give you this."
Leslie Knope,"No, he gets the dragon too?"

Ann Perkins,What do you mean?

Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"What the mothereffing, cing essing, effing king eff is going on right now?"
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, MonaLisa."
Tom Haverford,We can't keep our hands off each other.
Ann Perkins,That is accurate.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, it's all finally very clear."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"All the times that you were like, ""Oh, no, Tom's no good for you."""
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,And all the times you tried to break it off with me  I finally get it.
Ann Perkins,Mmhmm.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,You guys want a threesome.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,We do not wanna have a threesome with you.
Tom Haverford,"Well, let's not rush to judgment."
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I say we hear her out."
Ann Perkins,Gross.
Ann Perkins,"Tom, good luck."
Ann Perkins,You still owe me a blanket.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"She's got a screw loose, am I right?"
Tom Haverford,Actually she's not the one in my life I would call crazy.
Tom Haverford,"Look, I still don't think we should date."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, me neither."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I've been single for an hour now, and it's the tits!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'd still like to hook up though.

Andy Dwyer,"Coworkers, I bid you adieu."
Donna Meagle,"Whoa, fancy Andy."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, me?"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,This is just how I dress now.
Andy Dwyer,Funny goofball music Andy is gone.
Andy Dwyer,You're left with the professional remains.
Andy Dwyer,I'm an adult now.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm gonna focus on business, which is good."
Andy Dwyer,Give me more time to play video games.
April Ludgate,"Babe, you love that band that I also love so much."
April Ludgate,They're important to you.
April Ludgate,"Come on, call Burly and ask him to let you back in."
Andy Dwyer,"Why, so they can steal my swan song?"
Andy Dwyer,"Ha, joke's on them."
Andy Dwyer,I forgot it.
Andy Dwyer,"No, business is my life now."
April Ludgate,"Okay, what's in there?"
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Iit's locked.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's my briefcase."
Andy Dwyer,Is it?
Ron Swanson,Good gravy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I believe you know this gorilla.
Leslie Knope,"It used to bring joy to hundreds of Pawnee families, but then you got rid of its habitat, so it died."
Leslie Knope,Your office shall serve as its monkey tomb.
Ron Swanson,How much did you pay for this?
Leslie Knope,Irrelevant.
Leslie Knope,I would pay any amount of money to properly shame you.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you should know by now that I live my life according to a certain set of principles, and I do not deviate from them."
Leslie Knope,"Right, I mean, God forbid you're flexible in any way."
Leslie Knope,"You should just stick to your stupid, rigid, antigovernment principles."
Leslie Knope,But you know what?
Leslie Knope, Those principles stink.
Leslie Knope, They're not the right principles.
Ron Swanson, You may think so.
Ron Swanson, I do not.
Ron Swanson, Thank you for my new silver-backed friend.
Ron Swanson, I like him very much.
Ron Swanson," I will call him ""9,000 dollars of taxpayer money the gorilla."""
Leslie Knope,That is a terrible-- his name is Mr. Fuzzyface!
Ann Perkins,Hey.
Ann Perkins, How did your wild dirtbag fantasy night work out?
Tom Haverford,"Well, Mona-Lisa and the random girl she grabbed after you left got into a fistfight in the parking lot."
Tom Haverford," Eventually, Mona-Lisa threw a cinderblock through the girl's windshield."
Tom Haverford," She dives in, steals her purse, doesn't go for the money, steals all her birth control pills, and says, ""Bitch, you're gonna get pregnant."""
Tom Haverford,She then pretends those are ecstasy and sells it to a bunch of college kids that are drinking Goldschlager at a gas station.
Ann Perkins, You have to break up with her.
Tom Haverford, I tried.
Tom Haverford, Again.
Tom Haverford, It did not go well.
Ann Perkins, Did she assault you?
Tom Haverford,"No, this was a sexual injury."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, gross."
Tom Haverford," Anyway, here's your chenille blanket."
Tom Haverford, You earned it.
Tom Haverford, Thanks for your help.
Ann Perkins," Tom, thank you."
Tom Haverford," Eh, be nice to Chenille O'Neal."
Ann Perkins, I will.
Tom Haverford, It needs to be brushed regularly.
Tom Haverford, Never use a lint roller.
Tom Haverford,I'm dead serious.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Tom Haverford, And keep it out of direct sunlight.
Tom Haverford," If I see this at one picnic, I swear--"
Ann Perkins,"Okay, you know what, I don't even want it anymore."
Tom Haverford, Yes! Thank you!
Jeremy Jamm,"What's up, yellow head?"
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, are you here to rub it in my face that I lost your vote last night?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I was, but it doesn't have to go down that way."
Leslie Knope, You shook Ron's hand and told him that you were gonna vote to close the putt-putt.
Jeremy Jamm, My word is garbage.
Jeremy Jamm, Everyone knows that.
Jeremy Jamm, Let's talk deal.
Jeremy Jamm,What can you offer me to change my mind?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Jamm, even for you, this is pretty sleazy."
Jeremy Jamm," Hey, don't act so shocked."
Jeremy Jamm," A few months ago, you traded me your office for that stupid swimming pool bill."
Jeremy Jamm, Last night you bring in a teenage girl to pump me full of snow cones.
Jeremy Jamm, This is simply how people like us operate.
Leslie Knope, I have six things to say to you.
Leslie Knope, One: You drive me nuts with your rigid code of honor.
Leslie Knope," Two: Congratulations, putt-putt has been defunded."
Leslie Knope," And only because Jamm was going to double-cross you, and I made him stick to his word."
Leslie Knope, Three: I am furious that putt-putt has been defunded.
Leslie Knope, Four: I am sorry that I said the gorilla's blood was on your hands.
Leslie Knope, 'Twas Leslie killed the beast.
Leslie Knope," Five: Putt-putt is for children, and they are the future, and I have already written a ballot measure that will save it, and it will pass."
Leslie Knope," And six: Your rigid code of honor, which drives me nuts, makes you a wonderful human being, and I am proud to call you my friend, and don't ever change."
Ron Swanson,You want a drink?
Leslie Knope,Very much.
Andy Dwyer," Burly, I just want to say I'm sorry that I haven't been to rehearsal and that I won't let you sing or write songs or walk out onstage in front of me."
Andy Dwyer," Man, I love playing with you guys."
Andy Dwyer, And I want back in if you'll let me.
Burly," Well, we never wanted to kick you out."
Burly," It's just, you didn't show up for practice, and we like to play."
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Burly," If you wanna come back in, you can."
Burly, I'm more of a backup singer anyways.
April Ludgate, You can say that again.
Andy Dwyer," No, no, no."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, you got a great voice."
April Ludgate," Yeah, Ben! God, don't say that."
Burly,"Welcome back, buddy."
Andy Dwyer, - Yes.
Andy Dwyer," All right! Hey, I'll even try melting the cheese on the nachos."
Burly, All right.
Andy Dwyer, It won't work.
Andy Dwyer, You're gonna look like such an idiot.
Leslie Knope," I have been in the city council for almost a year, and I'm proud of what I've done."
Leslie Knope," But every once in a while, I end up in a situation that makes my stomach queasy."
Ron Swanson, You're in politics.
Ron Swanson, What did you expect?
Leslie Knope,"Frankly, I hoped it would be like dealing with you."
Leslie Knope, People with strong opinions hashing it out respectfully.
Leslie Knope, And then you either realize that I'm right or you get hungry and go home and I win.
Ron Swanson, There are a lot of Jeremy Jamms along the path you're walking.
Ron Swanson, I suppose you just need to figure out whether it's a path you truly wanna walk.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, I'm taking that gorilla with me and putting it back in the putt-putt - when it reopens.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, no."
Ron Swanson, That gorilla was a gift from a very determined co-worker whom I respect.
Ron Swanson, And there's a certain code of honor that accompanies gift-giving.
Leslie Knope," God, you're the worst."
Andy Dwyer," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mouse Rat's Reunion Show, featuring me, Andy Dwyer, and for the first time, Andrew ""Burly"" Burlinson on lead vocals."
Andy Dwyer," That's right, two lead vocalists."
Andy Dwyer, Name one other band that's done that.
Ben Wyatt, The Beatles.
Andy Dwyer," Three, four! "
Andy Dwyer,Oh I know we had bad times  but we had good times too

Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Look in your folders.
Leslie Knope,You will find information about founder's week.
Leslie Knope,"And before we start brainstorming, I just wanna thank Ron for lending us his cabin."
Ron Swanson,Lending?
Ron Swanson,Makes it sound like I had a choice in the matter.
Ron Swanson,I never should've agreed to this or let you know that I have a cabin or gotten to know any of you.
Leslie Knope,That's the spirit.
Leslie Knope,Founder's week is a yearly celebration of all things Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,"We've got a pie eating contest, a giant petting zoo, and the granddaddy of them all, the founder's week parade."
Leslie Knope,"I don't wanna overhype it, but our parade makes the rose bowl parade look like a turds on wheels convention."
Leslie Knope,Let's do an exercise.
Leslie Knope,"April, what makes Pawnee the best city in the world?"
April Ludgate,Easy: Most murders per capita.
April Ludgate,The guillotine was invented here.
April Ludgate,City Hall is run by the walrus mafia.
Leslie Knope,"Donna, help me out."
Leslie Knope,What makes Pawnee so great?
Donna Meagle,Cost of living is cheap.
Donna Meagle,"In about three years, I will have saved enough to pay off my condo in Seattle."
Ben Wyatt,You have a condo in Seattle?
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I like the rain and the fish markets."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we need to focus."
Leslie Knope,"I want this to be the best founder's week ever, okay?"
Leslie Knope,No more distractions.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm bored.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Let's go have sex in a tree.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,He'll be back in eight minutes.
Leslie Knope,Why did you have to bring her here?
Tom Haverford,I don't really have any power in this relationship.
Tom Haverford,I'll think of ideas in the tree.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Anyone's welcome to join us in the tree!
April Ludgate,Really?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Donna Meagle,You okay?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'm fine."
Andy Dwyer,"Good morning, colleagues, coworkers, friends."
Andy Dwyer,Everyone feeling normal today?
Andy Dwyer,Here's what happened.
Andy Dwyer,I left my sweat shirt at Ron's cabin.
Andy Dwyer,"When I went back to get it, I found this in the trash: Positive pregnancy test."
Andy Dwyer,Side note: I accidentally threw my sweat shirt away.
Andy Dwyer,That's why I was digging through the trash.
Andy Dwyer,Found that too.
Andy Dwyer,Pretty cool.
Andy Dwyer,"So if my science is correct, one of the five women who were at the cabin Leslie, Donna, Ann, MonaLisa, or April is pregnant!"
Andy Dwyer,Can't be April.
Andy Dwyer,She would've told me.
Andy Dwyer,That leaves four suspects.
Andy Dwyer,"There's only one man for this job: Bert Macklin, FBI."
Andy Dwyer,They said I was retired.
Andy Dwyer,They said I was too dangerous for the Pawnee Police Department.
Andy Dwyer,Turns out they were right and wrong.
Andy Dwyer,"Macklin, you son of a bitch."
Chris Traeger,"Hello, fellow Pawneeans."
Chris Traeger,"As you know, the founder's week festivities kick off tomorrow."
Chris Traeger,"Um, one small announcement: Due to a tragic misunderstanding, the prettiest pig beauty pageant has been replaced by a pork rib barbecue competition."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"But on to less grisly news, thank you for participating in our special founder's week public forum led by councilwoman Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Thanks to a lot of hard work and some very dedicated civil servants, this has been a banner year for our city."
Leslie Knope,Obesity and diabetes are down.
Leslie Knope,Test scores are up.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee raccoon attacks have decreased.
Leslie Knope,"People can now suddenly feel safe in our parks, grocery stores, and hospitals."
Leslie Knope,I am very proud of what we've accomplished.
Leslie Knope,"In fact, this forum is kind of my victory lap."
Leslie Knope,I am here today to ask you one question.
Leslie Knope,Are you better off now than you were a year ago?
Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?
Leslie Knope,Uhoh.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Kathryn Pinewood, Pawnee Restaurant Association."
Kathryn Pinewood,This town is not better off.
Kathryn Pinewood,"This past year has been a disaster, and this government is hellbent on stripping away our most basic personal freedoms."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, counterpoint."
Leslie Knope,"Ms. Pinewood, I've never stripped away anyone's freedoms."
Leslie Knope,I simply stopped a restaurant from serving an insane which only made our citizens healthier.
Leslie Knope,"And frankly, I don't see any of those citizens standing up and complaining about"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, I see them."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Tom Haverford,Darren!
Tom Haverford,Slow down!
Tom Haverford,"That sweat suit's not for sweating in, okay?"
Tom Haverford,This is crushed velvet.
Tom Haverford,"If you go at more than a brisk walk, it will fall apart."
Tom Haverford,This looks dope.
Tom Haverford,Let's pay for it.
Tom Haverford,Business is booming.
Tom Haverford,"If it keeps up like this, I would leave the Parks Department and do RentASwag fulltime, maybe even expand."
Tom Haverford,"I could add a baby section over there, call it ""Li'l Swaggers."""
Tom Haverford,"I could add some old people stuff, call it ""RentASag."""
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, no."
Tom Haverford,Old people are gross.
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,Nice.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, dingdong!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Can I go home?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"My tumtum feels gross, and also, I hate working."
Tom Haverford,"I guess, but find someone to cover for you, okay?"
Tom Haverford,'Cause we're really busy right now.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Also, a lawyer guy called you."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"He sounded really sexy on the phone, and I was very into that."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Like, I was, like, very into that."
Tom Haverford,"All right, let's set up some boundaries on what's cool for you to say to me, okay?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Okay.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I frenched my cousin one time.
Tom Haverford,That's gross.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I might still be in love with him.
Tom Haverford,Please leave.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"All right, bye."
Trevor Nelson,"Tom Haverford, my name is Trevor Nelsson."
Trevor Nelson,I represent a client who would like to make you an offer.
Tom Haverford,Babyface heard my demo?
Tom Haverford,I will accept a record deal.
Trevor Nelson,"No, you deeply misunderstand."
Trevor Nelson,My client has taken an interest in RentASwag.
Trevor Nelson,He'd like to know if you are looking to sell a controlling interest in the store.
Tom Haverford,"Whoa, Diddy wants to buy RentASwag?"
Trevor Nelson,Not what I said.
Tom Haverford,This is a lot to process.
Tom Haverford,Will Diddy be coming to the meeting?
Trevor Nelson,I'm not at liberty to tell you who my client is.
Trevor Nelson,It would violate confidentiality.
Tom Haverford,I understand.
Trevor Nelson,It's not Diddy.
Tom Haverford,Got it.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hello Ann."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Ann Perkins,"What do you want, Macklin?"
Andy Dwyer,Me?
Andy Dwyer,Just observing.
Andy Dwyer,A little something they taught us down at Quantico.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I guess I'll get out of your hair."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, there is just one more question."
Andy Dwyer,Congratulations.
Ann Perkins,Is that a question?
Andy Dwyer,"It's an accusation, 'cause I know your secret."
Andy Dwyer,You're pregnant.
Ann Perkins,What?
Ann Perkins,I'm not pregnant.
Andy Dwyer,You're not?
Andy Dwyer,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,Who is?
Andy Dwyer,'Cause I found this at Ron Swanson's cabin.
Andy Dwyer,It's a pregnancy test.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins,Someone we know is pregnant?
Ann Perkins,I'm trying to get pregnant.
Ann Perkins,That's not fair.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, great, and happy for them, and congratulations, whatever, but ooh!"
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Boo!
Ann Perkins,We have to find out who this is.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, I don't think so."
Andy Dwyer,Bert Macklin works alone.
Ann Perkins,I will buy lunch.
Ann Perkins,You can have as many burgers as you want.
Andy Dwyer,Welcome to the FBI.
Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Pinewood, Leslie's public health initiative has been a huge success."
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee is no longer the fourth most obese city in America.
Ben Wyatt,We're now ninth.
Chris Traeger,"Together, as a town, we lost an amount of weight equal to 800 pregnant manatees."
Leslie Knope,"A gym opened, and it stayed in business."
Leslie Knope,And people checking into the E.R. after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.
Kathryn Pinewood,But where will it end?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Now, you wanna rob our children of fun by attacking the Sweetums school lunch program, literally taking candy from babies."
Leslie Knope,Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.
Leslie Knope,You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.
Kathryn Pinewood,They're made from plants.
Kathryn Pinewood,Stop restricting our freedoms.
Extra,Yeah!
Dewey,My name is Dewey from Sanitation.
Dewey,"Ever since you stripped us of our freedoms by making us hire women, we've had to turn one of our bathrooms into a woman's bathroom."
Dewey,We only have one bathroom now.
Leslie Knope,"I'm so sorry, Dewey."
Leslie Knope,That sounds like a horrible price to pay for something as trivial as gender equality.
Dewey,So you agree.
Bjorn Lerpiss,Bjorn Lerpiss of the Pawnee Lerpiss family.
Bjorn Lerpiss,There was supposed to be a Paunch Burger in this lot next to my house.
Bjorn Lerpiss,"And then, you stripped my freedom by putting a park there."
Bjorn Lerpiss,"Now, if I wanna start my day off with a tripledecker pancake breakfast pizza, I gotta go to the one that's 10 minutes away, and that makes me 20 minutes late to work every day."
Bjorn Lerpiss,I work at home.
Chris Traeger,Have you ever considered not eating that for breakfast?
Bjorn Lerpiss,I'll never consider that.
Leslie Knope,This feels strangely personal.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's because they're all standing up saying how much they hate me as a person.
Andy Dwyer,"How many people am I talking to, Donna?"
Andy Dwyer,One or 1 1/9?
Donna Meagle,Are you asking me if I'm pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Interesting.
Andy Dwyer,I don't remember saying anything about anyone being pregnant.
Ann Perkins,Are you sure it's not you?
Donna Meagle,I'm a grown woman with a good head on her shoulders.
Donna Meagle,Don't worry about me.
Andy Dwyer,Whew.
Andy Dwyer,This case just got interesting.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, not just."
Andy Dwyer,It was pretty interesting to begin with.
Andy Dwyer,This case just remained interesting.
Marshall Langman,"Listen, my wife and I do not feel that we're better off than a year ago because a year ago, this town was not a horrifying sex den where people could put their body parts anywhere they want with impunity."
Marcia Langman,"And then, you were elected."
Marcia Langman,"And now, this town a horrifying sex den where people can put their body parts anywhere they want to with impunity."
Marshall Langman,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"If you are referring to my fight to teach comprehensive sex education, you need to at least acknowledge the fact that STDs are down 14% from last year."
Marshall Langman,And deviant behavior in Pawnee is up a billion percent!
Leslie Knope,"No, it's no, it's"
Marshall Langman,"This town is going to hell in a Gucci knockoff handbag, girl."
Marshall Langman,See?
Marshall Langman,See?
Marshall Langman,They agree.
Dennis Lerpiss,Come on.
Dennis Lerpiss,"I am definitely better off than I was a year ago, and it's all thanks to Leslie Knope."
Dennis Lerpiss,This woman singlehandedly saved my business.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Dennis."
Leslie Knope,"There you go, perfect example."
Leslie Knope,No need for further questions on that one.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Kathryn Pinewood,"What is your business, sir?"
Dennis Lerpiss,"Oh, I run a pornographic DVD emporium."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it used to be a quaint, little movie rental place with a lot of community value."
Herman,"Oh, it's much better now."
Extra,Yeah!
Brandi Maxxxx,Leslie is the best.
Leslie Knope,"No, no, Brandi."
Leslie Knope,"Gah, gah, gah, gah "
Brandi Maxxxx,"Hello, everyone."
Brandi Maxxxx,I'm Brandi Maxxxx
Extra,"Hi, Brandi."
Brandi Maxxxx,"Star of such films as the incredible Burt Wonderbone, A Good Guy to Lay Hard, and Argo."
Brandi Maxxxx,I had a small part in Argo as well as the porn version Our Goo.
Dennis Lerpiss,I've seen the first 90 seconds.
Dennis Lerpiss,It's thrilling.
Brandi Maxxxx,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, there would be far, far less pornography in this town."
Leslie Knope,"No, what happened was there was a misunderstanding, and I accidentally got the government involved in an unseemly business, but I cleared that up, and everything's fine."
Leslie Knope,It's not like I'm some kind of sex crazed maniac or something.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, are you pregnant?"
Andy Dwyer,Did you or did you not leave this positive pregnancy test in a dumpster in the woods?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, everybody."
Leslie Knope,No.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll get out of your hair."
Ann Perkins,Sorry to interrupt.
Andy Dwyer,Was that Brandi Maxxxx?
Tom Haverford,"Investors, I have some very exciting news about RentASwag."
Tom Haverford,"Someone I'm not saying Diddy, but I'm not not saying Diddy has offered to buy out RentASwag for a buttload of money."
Ron Swanson,"How big a buttload, son?"
Tom Haverford,We would all basically double our investments.
Donna Meagle,Are you kidding me?
Donna Meagle,"Sell, baby."
Donna Meagle,Imagine the kind of treat yourself day we could have with the profits.
Donna Meagle,I'm talking pedicures on pedicures on pedicures.
Tom Haverford,That is appealing.
Ron Swanson,"If someone is interested in buying you out, it means you're doing something right."
Ron Swanson,"I say you continue to grow, accumulate power, find this investor, and buy his business to teach him a lesson."
Tom Haverford,"April, what do you think?"
April Ludgate,I thought about this a lot.
April Ludgate,"I actually think that you should get a ""Hello Kitty"" tattoo."
Tom Haverford,"No, with the store."
April Ludgate,Oh.
April Ludgate,"Uh, burn it for the insurance money."
Jerry Gergich,"Tom, listen to me, if there's one thing I've learned"
April Ludgate,"God, nobody cares, Gary."
Tom Haverford,Enough.
Donna Meagle,Thank you.
Jerry Gergich,I miss you guys.
Chris Traeger,What a wonderful event.
Chris Traeger,Everyone is having fun.
Chris Traeger,This is great.
Leslie Knope,"Chris, could you just please"
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, I was just trying to cheer you up."
Chris Traeger,Just hang in there.
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,"All right, if you'll excuse me, I found out this morning that I am playing a special role in this parade."
Chris Traeger,No spoilers.
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, I hate to state the obvious, but you chose a life in politics."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, the more you actually accomplish, the more heat you're gonna draw."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Ben Wyatt,Let's go watch the parade.
Ben Wyatt,You know you can't resist a parade.
Leslie Knope,That's true.
Leslie Knope,Parades and your butt:  My two vices.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,My assistant has something she'd like to show you.
Ann Perkins,Partner.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my assistant has something she'd like to show you, partner."
Andy Dwyer,"It's a positive pregnancy test, Tom."
Andy Dwyer,I found it outside of Ron's cabin after our brainstorming session.
Andy Dwyer,Is there any possibility MonaLisa could be pregnant?
Tom Haverford,We always use protection but I'm pretty positive she pokes holes in them.
Tom Haverford,What brand pregnancy test is it?
Ann Perkins,"It's called ""Womb There It Is."""
Tom Haverford,That's her brand.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna be a dad?
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna have a baby with JeanRalphio's sister?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,What have I done?
Tom Haverford,"Like, to humanity?"
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect thing to take my mind off of yesterday.
Leslie Knope,I am going to pretend that this is my victory parade and the town is celebrating my hard work and dedication.
Ben Wyatt,There you go.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, Leslie."
Chris Traeger,I'm so sorry.
Chris Traeger,I need to talk to you.
Ben Wyatt,What are what?
Chris Traeger,I'm the Nipple King.
Leslie Knope,Kernston's Rubber Nipple Company elects a nipple king and a nipple queen every year to ride on the float.
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Chris Traeger,It's such an amazing honor.
Leslie Knope,It's wonderful.
Chris Traeger,"But I do need to talk to you about a float that is in this parade, because I'm not sure that you're going to be"
Extra,No fun for you!
Chris Traeger,Uhoh.
Extra,No fun for you!
Leslie Knope,Is that me?
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it's not you.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it's Kate Upton.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"No, it's me, and damn them."
Extra,No fun for you!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, stop, please!"
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, I don't mean to stop your parade or anything, but I just have to say something here, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I don't think this is very fair!
Ben Wyatt,"Babe babe, stop wagging your finger."
Leslie Knope,Certain people are lashing out at me because of things that I did this year.
Leslie Knope,But I am not trying to stop you from having fun.
Leslie Knope,I am an extremely fun person.
Kathryn Pinewood,"This float represents a group of over 300 business owners, individuals, and community leaders who are protesting unfair government regulation."
Kathryn Pinewood,We are the committee to recall Leslie Knope.
Kathryn Pinewood,Let's kick her out of office.
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Brett,Legalize weed!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Kathryn Pinewood,Recall Knope!
Tom Haverford,"So, I need to ask you something and I kinda wish JeanRalphio wasn't here."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Please tell me that you're dumping my sister, because I will laugh I will laugh so much."
Tom Haverford,"Actually, it may be the opposite."
Tom Haverford,Is this yours?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Yeah.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,It's mine.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I'm pregnant.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Lemony snicket.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, my God, are you serious?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm gonna be an uncle?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that a real thing?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that gonna happen?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, no, that's too much too much responsibility for me."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I gotta I gotta find another way out of this.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I wish you told me."
Tom Haverford,"I mean, obviously, we need to talk about our future."
Tom Haverford,"Maybe I could sell the business, and we could use the profits to put a down payment on a house or something, or"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Psych!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ah, ha, ha."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Look at your stupid face.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You had a dumdum face.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,That was hilarious.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, that was  hilarious"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's hilarious
Tom Haverford,So you're not pregnant?
Tom Haverford,This isn't yours?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"[Bleep], no."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Do you know how many different pills I take, birth control or otherwise?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,There is no way that I could be pregnant with a human baby.
Tom Haverford,Thank God.
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,Tommy has his life back!
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What the hell is wrong with you, man?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's my sister.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Nah!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm just kidding, man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,She's the worst.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You dodged a bullet, baby."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Congratulations.
Tom Haverford,Thanks.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Bad, bad, bad, bad."
Ann Perkins,"Well, Macklin, it's not MonaLisa."
Ann Perkins,"It's not me, it's not Donna, it's not Leslie."
Ann Perkins,There was only one other woman at that cabin.
Andy Dwyer,April?
Andy Dwyer,"No, she would've told me."
Andy Dwyer,"Besides, the math doesn't add up because we only have sex every single day."
Andy Dwyer,"And since she's the only one that we haven't talked to, it has to be hers."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,I don't like seeing you like this.
Leslie Knope,I've never felt this way before.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should just quit.
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we should both quit, and we should move to the Bahamas, live on a beach, catch fish with homemade spears."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you'd last about 30 seconds with that work."
Ben Wyatt,"When we went to Hawaii, you woke me up at 3:00 A.M. to watch Meet the Press."
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was Elizabeth Warren."
Leslie Knope,"Like, I'm not going to watch that live?"
Ben Wyatt,"Look, you can hate your job sometimes."
Ben Wyatt,It's allowed.
Ben Wyatt,But let me ask you this: Do you think this town is better off  than it was a year ago?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Do you stand behind everything you've done?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,Then screw 'em.
Leslie Knope,"But even if I wanted to fight this recall, how would I do it?"
Leslie Knope, Thank you all for coming.
Leslie Knope," As most of you probably know, there is a large committee that has announced plans to recall me from office."
Leslie Knope, My response to them is this: Bring it on.
Leslie Knope, Step up.
Leslie Knope, Step Up 2: The Streets.
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry, my adrenaline is pumping, so all I can think of is dance movie titles."
Leslie Knope, Stomp the Yard.
Leslie Knope, There's one.
Leslie Knope," Look, I work very hard for this town, as hard as I can, and all that matters to me is whether or not everyone here thinks that they are better off now than they were a year ago."
Leslie Knope, I think you are.
Leslie Knope," If you disagree with me, then go ahead and recall me."
Leslie Knope, Go crazy.
Leslie Knope, You Got Served.
Leslie Knope," Silver Linings Playbook, kind of."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep, The committee says they plan to push for a recall vote within two months.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Do you have a comment on that?
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope," Again, all I really care about is are you better off?"
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I think I'm better off.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep," I haven't had a date in a while, but I'm learning a lot about me."
Leslie Knope," Well, I wasn't asking you specifically, but I'm happy to hear that, Shauna."
Leslie Knope," So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall."
Leslie Knope," No, I can't end my big press conference by saying ""Recall, shmecall."""
Leslie Knope,That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope," Ben, can you help me out here?"
Ben Wyatt,That concludes councilwoman Knope's press conference.
Ben Wyatt," And if you have any further questions hold on to them, because she has a lot of work to do."
Leslie Knope," Thanks, honey."
Leslie Knope, Honey.
Leslie Knope, That's another dance movie with Jessica alba.
Leslie Knope," Alright, people."
Leslie Knope, The Pawnee river's not gonna clean itself.
Leslie Knope," Volunteer weekend task force, mobilize."
Chris Traeger," Oh, Leslie, this goes without saying, but if you need any speeches or testimonials or just general enthusiasm for your recall fight, I'm your man."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,You're welcome.
Chris Traeger, I'll see you at the river.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, oh, oh!"
Chris Traeger,Last one to pick up has still accomplished a great deal.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, maybe after, you wanna come meet me and Chris for a drink?"
Leslie Knope,Sure.
Leslie Knope," Hey, how's it going with you guys?"
Ann Perkins,"We're great, actually, and we're having a good time."
Ann Perkins,Sex is ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Ann Perkins," Hopefully, that ridiculous sex will lead to a baby."
Leslie Knope, I'm so happy for you.
Leslie Knope, Just remember to use protection.
Leslie Knope," Wait, no, don't."
Leslie Knope, That would defeat the purpose.
Leslie Knope," Okay, no."
Leslie Knope, Do your thing.
Andy Dwyer, Yeah! My wife is pregnant!
April Ludgate,"Okay, put me down."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, you can't keep it from me."
Andy Dwyer," I found the pregnancy test, honey."
April Ludgate," Honey, I'm not pregnant, okay? And if I were, you shouldn't lift me up."
Andy Dwyer," Wait, are you sure you're not?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate, We've talked about this.
April Ludgate, Remember? I wanna wait until we're 50 and then adopt a set of creepy adult twins from Romania.
Andy Dwyer," Oh, yeah."
Andy Dwyer, Of course.
April Ludgate," Actually, there is something I need to tell you."
Andy Dwyer, You're pregnant.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,No! We just ruled that out.
Andy Dwyer,"Ah, dang it."
April Ludgate,"Okay, a while ago, I applied to veterinary school in Bloomington, and I just found out that I got in."
Andy Dwyer," You did? That's amazing! Wait, why did you wait to tell me?"
April Ludgate,"Because I don't even know if I wanna go, okay? I mean, yes, it's been my dream to work with animals since I was a kid and everything."
April Ludgate," But it would mean I would be spending a lot of time apart from you, and"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we could get through that."
Andy Dwyer," I mean, look."
Andy Dwyer," It would suck for a while, and I would miss you while you're gone."
Andy Dwyer," But as I've known about you for the past 20 seconds, this is your dream."
April Ludgate, I'm really glad I married you.
Andy Dwyer," Yeah, we made a good call on that one."
Tom Haverford, So I just wanted to let you know I will not be selling Rent-A-Swag.
Tom Haverford,And you can go tell your client he now has 100 problems?
Tom Haverford,Is it Jay-Z?
Trevor Nelson,No.
Trevor Nelson," But since you're not taking the deal, I should inform you that my client will be moving on to plan B: Opening his own store directly across the street from yours."
Tom Haverford, Across the street? What kind of store is it gonna be?
Trevor Nelson,"He's calling it ""Tommy's Closet."""
Trevor Nelson,"It's a high-end secondhand clothing store where parents can rent clothes for their teens, tweens, and pres, as well as babies, toddlers, grown-ups, and olds."
Tom Haverford, But that's my idea and my name.
Trevor Nelson, So I guess only Domino's is allowed to sell pizza now?
Trevor Nelson,"It's called capitalism, Mr. Haverford, and you are about to get a free lesson."
Trevor Nelson, Only this free lesson is going to cost you.
Tom Haverford, So it's not free?
Trevor Nelson,You're right.
Trevor Nelson, That was confusing.
Trevor Nelson, This lesson will cost you.
Trevor Nelson, Good day.
Tom Haverford," This sucks, but I have to admit: It's a pretty baller move."
Tom Haverford, You sure this isn't Diddy?
Trevor Nelson,It is Diddy.
Tom Haverford,I knew it!
Trevor Nelson,It's not Diddy.
Andy Dwyer, Are you sure everything will be all right if April goes to vet school?
Ron Swanson,"There are no sure things in life, son, but you two seem pretty solid to me."
Andy Dwyer,"Change is good, I guess."
Ron Swanson,Not to me.
Ron Swanson, Leslie's going around asking everybody if they're better off than they were a year ago.
Ron Swanson, All I care about is that I'm the same.
Ron Swanson," If I'm the same as I was a year ago, I'm happy."
Andy Dwyer," Wait, I forgot."
Andy Dwyer,Who the hell is pregnant?
Ron Swanson,What?
Andy Dwyer,"I found a pregnancy test at your cabin, and I checked with all the girls over there."
Andy Dwyer, It wasn't any of them.
Ron Swanson," Hello, darling."
Ron Swanson, What a surprise.
Diane Lewis, Hey.
Diane Lewis, Can we talk? Maybe in private?

Andy Dwyer,"Wait, I forgot!"
Andy Dwyer,Who the hell is pregnant?
Ron Swanson,What?
Andy Dwyer,I found a pregnancy test at your cabin and I checked with all the girls over there and wasn't any of them.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, darling, what a surprise."
Diane Lewis,Hey.
Diane Lewis,Can we talk?
Diane Lewis,Maybe in private.
Andy Dwyer,You and me?
Ron Swanson,"I believe she's referring to me, son."
Ron Swanson,Please excuse us.
Diane Lewis,So I am pregnant.
Ron Swanson,I see.
Diane Lewis,I don't understand how.
Diane Lewis,We were so careful.
Ron Swanson,I warned you about this.
Ron Swanson,Standard birth control methods aren't usually effective against a Swanson.
Diane Lewis,"I got about a million thoughts running around in my head, but I really just want to know what you're thinking."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, here's what I'm thinking."
Ron Swanson,"I was gonna wait until our anniversary, take you somewhere romantic, perhaps in a canoe most likely in a canoe."
Ron Swanson,"I actually built a canoe for that purpose, but given the news, and given my significant feelings for you, now seems as good a time as any."
Diane Lewis,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,Diane Lewis will you marry me?
Diane Lewis,Yes.
Diane Lewis,On one condition.
Ron Swanson,"Anything, my love."
Ron Swanson,"Ask me for anything in the world, and I'll give it to you, except a destination wedding."
Diane Lewis,Just the opposite.
Diane Lewis,We've both been married before.
Diane Lewis,I don't want anything big or elaborate.
Diane Lewis,"In fact, the smaller the better."
Diane Lewis,I assume you can deal with that.
Ron Swanson,Are you kidding?
Ron Swanson,"As far as I'm concerned, we could go up to the fourth floor right now."
Leslie Knope,"Well, hello there."
Diane Lewis,"Hey, Leslie."
Diane Lewis,What's with the getup?
Leslie Knope,We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.
April Ludgate,Where are you guys going?
Ron Swanson,"The fourth floor, getting married."
Leslie Knope,Okeydokey.
Leslie Knope,"Well, catch you later."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Wha What who's what the
Ron Swanson,Are you dead?
Ron Swanson,You look like you're in rictus.
Leslie Knope,I justI'm having so many thoughts and feelings that I'm paralyzed right now.
Diane Lewis,Would you ladies like to come?
April Ludgate,Can I be the best man?
Ron Swanson,Why not?
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Ron is getting married, and I love him, and I care about him, and this is the greatest day ever, and I do not have time to talk about this!"
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"If you would just slow down a little, then I could arrange balloons or a flower cake  or a bouncy castle"
Ron Swanson,Ah!
Ron Swanson,"Ethel Beavers, we would like a marriage license, please and thank you."
Ethel Beavers,What's the date of the wedding?
Ron Swanson,Today.
Diane Lewis,"It's a bit unusual,  but we both"
Ethel Beavers,Don't care.
Diane Lewis,"Leslie Knope, would you please be my matron of honor?"
Leslie Knope,"Diane, you have no idea what that means to me."
Ron Swanson,She gets it.
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is like a waking nightmare of happiness."
Leslie Knope,I need to get some flowers.
Leslie Knope,Why don't you hold this colorful bouquet of highlighters?
Leslie Knope,"Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice."
Leslie Knope,Why is there no rice in this municipal government building?
April Ludgate,I found a justice guy.
April Ludgate,These are the marrying people.
April Ludgate,This is Carl.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Carl."
Ron Swanson,"My fiancee and I would like to get married right now, right here."
Extra,Haven't I done a quickie wedding for you before?
Ron Swanson,"It's certainly possible, but this one's going to stick."
Ethel Beavers,I need your full names for the license.
Ron Swanson,Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
Diane Lewis,Diane Tammy Lewis.
Ron Swanson,Tammy?
Ron Swanson,Your middle name is 
Diane Lewis,"Just kidding, it's Elizabeth."
Ron Swanson,"Let's go, Carl."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."
Leslie Knope,"Let's pump the brakes, Carl, okay?"
Ron Swanson,"Belay that order, Carl."
Ron Swanson,Shortest possible ceremony.
Ron Swanson,I'm tired of not being married to this woman.
Extra,"Do you, Ron Swanson, take Diane to be your wife?"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's going to start!"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, it's happening!"
Ron Swanson,I certainly do.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Extra,"And do you, Diane, take  Yes!"
Diane Lewis,"Yes, I do."
Leslie Knope,She said yes!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Extra,By the power vested in me 
Leslie Knope,"Before you Carl, just one second."
Leslie Knope,"I would just like to give a short speech, if I may."
Ron Swanson,You have ten seconds.
Leslie Knope,"At first glance, it may seem as though Ron Swanson and I have nothing in common, but Webster's dictionary defines ""friend"" "
Ron Swanson,Time.
Leslie Knope,It's ugh!
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,"I could tell where you were going with that, and it was gonna be beautiful."
Extra,I now pronounce you 
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Extra,man and wife.
Leslie Knope,Hooray!
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Ron Swanson,"Great job, everyone."
Ron Swanson,"The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone."
Leslie Knope,Pretend this is rice!
Leslie Knope,That was beautiful.
Leslie Knope,The people who want to boot me from office have been viciously attacking me for weeks.
All,Recall Knope!
All,Recall Knope!
Harris,Legalize weed!
Leslie Knope,"Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle."
Leslie Knope,"The clue ""Who's the worst,"" but you know what?"
Leslie Knope,We're fighting back.
Leslie Knope,I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.
Leslie Knope,"We are currently in phase 26: ""No problem too small."""
Leslie Knope,"Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today?"
Gretel,There are slugs everywhere on the sidewalk in front of my house.
Gretel,I want them gone but not killed I love animals.
Gretel,But get rid of them.
Gretel,They're gross.
Gretel,But make sure they're happy but not too happy.
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're on it, because ""No problem too small."""
Ann Perkins,So what now?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have about 30 more people who want to come into my office and complain to my face."
Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope!
Ann Perkins,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins.
Chris Traeger,Mm.
Chris Traeger,How's the recall fight going?
Leslie Knope,This person to person campaigning is kind of wearing me down.
Ann Perkins,"Well, as a wise woman once said to me, ""Ann, you cunning, pliable, chestnut haired sunfish, phase 26 is the key to my plan."""
Leslie Knope,"Good memory, sunfish."
Leslie Knope,Let's press on.
Leslie Knope,I have to come up with some solution for this slug problem.
Chris Traeger,Someone has a slug infestation?
Chris Traeger,"Boy, oh, boy, we live interesting lives, filled with unexpected challenges."
Chris Traeger,"Life is precious, and every day is a miracle."
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Ann Perkins,What a freak.
Ann Perkins,Things with me and Chris are going really well.
Ann Perkins,"We spend every day together, and we're having so much fun."
Ann Perkins,And check this out.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, there's no ring."
Ann Perkins,We just had manicures together recently.
Ann Perkins,"Sorry, that was misleading."
Trevor Nelson,"Ah, Mr. Haverford, back again, I see."
Tom Haverford,"What the hell, man?"
Tom Haverford,This looks exactly like my store!
Trevor Nelson,I know.
Trevor Nelson,My client is a very determined businessman.
Trevor Nelson,"When he rips someone off, he goes all the way."
Trevor Nelson,"You see, you are Hydrox, Mr. Haverford."
Trevor Nelson,We are Oreo.
Tom Haverford,"Your mysterious, unnamed client seems like a pretty intense guy."
Tom Haverford,I am impressed by how quickly he was able to move such a large amount of merchandise.
Trevor Nelson,Mm.
Tom Haverford,He must be one heck of a transporter.
Trevor Nelson,"My client is not Jason Statham, if that's what you're thinking."
Tom Haverford,Some mysterious big shot investor has opened up a store directly across the street from rentaswag to try to put me out of business.
Tom Haverford,"I'm not worried, though."
Tom Haverford,I've poured my heart and soul into my store.
Tom Haverford,I'm sure this guy's just looking for a place to store all his NBA championship trophies.
Trevor Nelson,It's not Lebron James.
Tom Haverford,Damn.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think ""No problem too small"" is working."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers."
Ben Wyatt,"I agree, we need something massive and attention getting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning."
Ann Perkins,I got it!
Leslie Knope,What is it?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, no, I just I got a fly."
April Ludgate,I have something.
April Ludgate,"Remember phase 13, ""Think outside of the box""?"
Leslie Knope,Of course.
Leslie Knope,It was an amazing phase.
Ben Wyatt,Easily a top five phase.
April Ludgate,"Well, I thought outside of the box, and I nominated you for this big award."
April Ludgate,"It's called ""The International Coalition of Women in Government,"" and you won."
April Ludgate,"There's, like, five winners, and you get a big trophy or something."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God, this is real."
Chris Traeger,I just assumed you were lying.
April Ludgate,"Thank you, but yeah, it's real."
April Ludgate,"Ann Richards won it once, and Janet Napolitano, I think."
Leslie Knope,Janet Napoli freaking tano?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is amazing and perfect.
Leslie Knope,"This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention."
Leslie Knope,When is the ceremony?
April Ludgate,Next month in London.
Leslie Knope,London?
Ben Wyatt,London?
Leslie Knope,We're going to London?
Leslie Knope,"We're going to London, you guys!"
Andy Dwyer,I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!
Ben Wyatt,"No, that's Buckingham Palace."
Ben Wyatt,Hogwarts is fictional.
Ben Wyatt,Do you know that?
Ben Wyatt,It's important to me that you know that.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today."
Leslie Knope,"Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history."
Ron Swanson,"History began on July 4, 1776."
Ron Swanson,Everything before that was a mistake.
Ron Swanson,"Diane suggested we ""tag along to London"" for a honeymoon."
Ron Swanson,"I agreed, because my love for her trumps my hatred for Europe."
Ron Swanson,"Then she hit a phase of morning sickness that knocked her for a loop and decided to stay home, but she insisted I go and take pictures for her."
Ron Swanson,"All of this could have been avoided if we'd followed my plan for a honeymoon: a steak dinner, a glass of Lagavulin whiskey, then vigorous lovemaking for two hours, and we're both asleep by 8:30."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie, we're gonna head to the meeting."
Ben Wyatt,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, you're in London."
Ben Wyatt,"You're 4,000 miles away from home."
Ben Wyatt,"Try to enjoy this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you're right, as usual."
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ooh, hey boss man, I want to go home early."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Ooh, hold on, actually."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hang on.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yeah, no."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I want to quit and never come here again.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, bye."
Tom Haverford,I can't believe I used to date you!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tommy Pickles!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You see there's a better version of your store across the street?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"And those guys are giving out free pizza with ""papperonas."""
Tom Haverford,"I know, man."
Tom Haverford,That's my competition.
Tom Haverford,"They're trying to put me out of business, and it's working."
Tom Haverford,"Three weeks ago, this place was hopping."
Tom Haverford,My clothes were flying off the rack.
Tom Haverford,I was spreading swag around town like a killer swag virus.
Tom Haverford,"Now, look at this place."
Tom Haverford,It's dead!
Tom Haverford,What am I gonna do?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"It's like I always say, okay?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"When life gives you lemons, you sell some of your grandma's jewelry, and you go clubbing."
Tom Haverford,That's not a good piece of advice.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,So I'ma throw up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I ate too much cheese.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'll talk to you!
Tom Haverford,I need some better friends.
Ben Wyatt,So the only thing you did was stop drinking beer?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I lost 50 pounds in one month."
Ben Wyatt,How much beer were you drinking?
Andy Dwyer,"I know, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Probably too much.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I are meeting with an English charity foundation to expand our afterschool music program, and British people love me."
Ben Wyatt,"There was this British kid in my high school who always called me ""Big Ben"" and would punch me really hard on the arm, and go, ""Bong! Bong! Bo"""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, he might have hated me."
Andy Dwyer,"Real quick, should I do a British accent?"
Ben Wyatt,"Um, I'm gonna say no."
Andy Dwyer,You sure?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I can do one.
Andy Dwyer,"It's not very good, but I think I could pull it off."
Andy Dwyer,I just feel like he's gonna get upset when he finds out that we're American.
Ben Wyatt,He knows we're American.
Andy Dwyer,"Ugh, great."
Andy Dwyer,"All right, well, I guess we'll take the meeting anyway."
Andy Dwyer,"After all, we did come all the way down under."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"This is Andy Dwyer, and it is an honor to meet you, sir."
Lord Covington,"Well, it's nice to meet you too."
Lord Covington,"However, the proper mode of address would be ""Your Royal Excellency, Lord Edgar Darby Covington, ""14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, 29th Baron of Hertfordshire."""
Lord Covington,"No, no, no, I'm kidding."
Lord Covington,I'm kidding.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Lord Covington,"Please, call me Eddie."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, thank God."
Andy Dwyer,I knew that other name must have been a stupid joke.
Ben Wyatt,Andy
Lord Covington,"No, no, no, no, he's absolutely right, it's an absurd name."
Lord Covington,"Well, I'm excited to hear about your musical charity idea."
Lord Covington,Shall we?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, andoh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also."
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your pick."
Ron Swanson,"Look, a clock."
Ron Swanson,We don't have that in America.
Ron Swanson,You call that a tower?
Ron Swanson,"Try the Sears Tower, friend."
Ron Swanson,"""London at night."""
Ron Swanson,That is very funny.
Extra,"Can I help you, sir?"
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I will take this.
Extra,"We don't accept American currency, sir."
Ron Swanson,Of course you do.
Ron Swanson,That's the most wonderful piece of paper in the world.
Ron Swanson,Accept it.
Extra,"Very sorry, sir."
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"Enjoy the fact that your royal overlords are a frail, old woman and a tiny baby."
Tom Haverford,"You really think this will work, Donna?"
Donna Meagle,Why wouldn't it?
Donna Meagle,We just pull the business license it's public information and then at least you'll have an address.
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, here."
Donna Meagle,"Hmm, some kind of shady, fake shell corporation  called ""Open 4 Business, LLC."""
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, if it's Akon and y'all become best friends, I want a ride on his plane."
Tom Haverford,Done and done.
Donna Meagle,Nice.
Tom Haverford,"""1020 Maple Street."""
Tom Haverford,Ann and Chris?
Tom Haverford,What are they doing here?
Extra,"Sir, you can't go in there!"
Tom Haverford,Aha!
Tom Haverford,I caught you!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, it's Tom!"
Ann Perkins,What the hell are you doing?
Tom Haverford,What am I doing?
Tom Haverford,What are you doing here?
Ann Perkins,"Dr. Saperstein is giving me a sonogram, in his doctor's office, for women, because I'm pregnant!"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,You're JeanRalphio's dad!
Dr. Saperstein,Mmhmm.
Tom Haverford,You're the one that's trying to put me out of business!
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, look at that, Mr. Haverford."
Dr. Saperstein,You tracked me down.
Dr. Saperstein,"Looks like your detective skills are a lot better than your tween, high end fashion rental skills."
Tom Haverford,"Ann, Chris, can we have the room, please?"
Chris Traeger,"No, you certainly cannot."
Tom Haverford,"Dr. Saperstein, why are you doing this?"
Tom Haverford,What did I ever do to you?
Dr. Saperstein,You know exactly why I'm doing this.
Dr. Saperstein,You destroyed my family.
Dr. Saperstein,"First, you screwed my son out of your business, and then you stole my daughter's virginity."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, you're serious?"
Dr. Saperstein,Deadly serious.
Dr. Saperstein,"According to my daughter, you broke her heart."
Dr. Saperstein,Then you smashed up her BMW.
Dr. Saperstein,"I had to buy her a new one, so she could drive to Divinity School."
Dr. Saperstein,"Let me tell you something, mister."
Dr. Saperstein,"You attack a Saperstein, you face my wrath."
Dr. Saperstein,"Be so sure about this, Tiny Tom, that I will crush you like the bug you are And there it is, the heartbeat."
Chris Traeger,Ohh.
Dr. Saperstein,Everything sounds perfect.
Chris Traeger,Ohh.
Chris Traeger,This is the moment we were dreaming of: you and me and our baby.
Chris Traeger,And Tom and his weird feud with our doctor.
Ben Wyatt,"So this after school music program has been really successful in Pawnee, and we've expanded it to eight other towns in Indiana, but we feel with your help, we can"
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,Are those I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Andy Dwyer,Are those remote control helicopters?
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Lord Covington,I got them as a gift.
Lord Covington,"I bought them for one of my nephews,  and then I decided to keep them."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Lord Covington,Would you like to play with them?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, would I?"
Andy Dwyer,I call blue one!
Lord Covington,I call the oh.
Lord Covington,"Okay, you get the blue one."
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, we are guests of Lord Covington."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should let him play with the blue helicopter.
Andy Dwyer,"What are you talking about, dude?"
Andy Dwyer,I called it.
Lord Covington,He called it.
Andy Dwyer,That's the rule.
Lord Covington,That's the rule.
Lord Covington,"Anyway, the orange one's better."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Lord Covington,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Aah!
Lord Covington,"Hey, get off!"
Lord Covington,"Okay, watch out!"
Lord Covington,Watch out!
Lord Covington,Agh!
Andy Dwyer,Ohh!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, awesome."
Andy Dwyer,I think I broke mine!
Lord Covington,"Oh, bummer."
Andy Dwyer,"So, like, you your family owns all this stuff?"
Lord Covington,"Well, no, not everything."
Lord Covington,"We own that building, that one, that house, that round thing, that one."
Lord Covington,We don't own that.
Lord Covington,"Oh, no, actually, we do own that."
Andy Dwyer,What else does your family own?
Lord Covington,"Well, um, have you heard of Scotland?"
Ben Wyatt,"As I was saying, we've really made this music program work in Indiana, and we think, with your help, we could turn this into a wide reaching international program."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, you know what I want?"
Andy Dwyer,Ice cream.
Andy Dwyer,"Do you guys have that here, ice cream?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's so good."
Andy Dwyer,You have to get it.
Andy Dwyer,"It's, like, scoops, and it comes on a cone."
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Do you have that here?
Lord Covington,We have it.
Lord Covington,Of course we have it.
Andy Dwyer,You have it?
Lord Covington,"Where do you think you are, the moon?"
Andy Dwyer,That'd be awesome if we were.
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Can we get some?
Andy Dwyer,Could we do could we have some?
Lord Covington,Could we?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Lord Covington,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,Just what do I do with this?
Lord Covington,Just throw it there.
Lord Covington,Roger will pick it up.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"""So I long for a day when women in government will simply be seen as people in government, but until then, I will work to make Pawnee, my wonderful hometown, as good as it can be."""
Leslie Knope,What do you think?
April Ludgate,"I think you should lose the first line and the last line and all of the other lines, and instead, just walk up to the mic and meow really loudly for eight minutes."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I want to know what's happening there.
Leslie Knope,One little news blast wouldn't hurt.
Perd Hapley,Welcome to The Final Word With Perd.
Perd Hapley,"Ms. Pinewood, there is a thing you are doing, and that thing is you are leading a recall vote against Councilwoman Knope, and you say you have new, shocking allegations about her."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,What now?
Kathryn Pinewood,"Perd, I take no pleasure in reporting this, but it must come to light."
Kathryn Pinewood,"We are here, trying to make Pawnee better, and where is Leslie Knope?"
Kathryn Pinewood,She's gallivanting around Europe like some kind of European.
Leslie Knope,How how did they get that picture so
April Ludgate,Facebook.
Leslie Knope,But I just put
April Ludgate,Facebook.
Leslie Knope,But isn't it a 
April Ludgate,Facebook.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Apparently, she can't be bothered to stay here in Pawnee, not when there's Europe to gallivant around in."
Perd Hapley,"Well, we conducted a Perd poll and asked this question: not be in Europe, and 35% said they were confused by the way the question was posed."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,You're leaving tonight?
Ron Swanson,I can't believe there's even a flight?
Leslie Knope,"Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 redeye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.M. back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned."
Leslie Knope,Easy breezy!
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do not think you should leave Europe right now."
Ron Swanson,You flew all this way.
Ron Swanson,Have some perspective.
Leslie Knope,You have some perspective!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Maybe you're right.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'm stressed.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I need to calm down."
Leslie Knope,Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, who is that?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,My dad said that?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, JeanRalphio."
Tom Haverford,He told me that I had screwed you  out of my business 
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What?
Tom Haverford,So he was gonna screw me back.
Tom Haverford,Any idea why he'd believe such a thing?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That is so weird.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That is so oh, you know what?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, this may be it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I actually told him that RentASwag was my idea and that you had stole it from me.
Tom Haverford,Why would you say that?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Because my dad is always riding me for never having a job, and I just didn't want to show that I blew it again."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Oh and I don't know if this is relevant
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hmm.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,But I told him that you made me sign up for a bunch of credit cards and then max them out by buying illegal white jaguar fur coats.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That's probably not relevant, though."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"It's probably not relevant, though."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I don't know  I guess
Tom Haverford,All this lying about me stops now!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,This is my life.
Tom Haverford,"Please, one of you has to tell him the truth."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Not it!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Not it!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Ooh, you got me!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Whoa ho!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uhoh, uhoh!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Uhoh, uhoh, uhoh."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, fine."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You know what?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm gonna do the unthinkable.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna have a short, honest conversation with my father."
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that's a big cheering section."
April Ludgate,"Okay, that's Khongordzol, from Mongolia."
April Ludgate,"She grew up in a hut that was entirely made of ice and mud, then she became their mayor, then their police chief and their best Wolverine Wrangler."
April Ludgate,I love her.
Ulee Danssen,"Oh, hi."
Ulee Danssen,You must be Leslie Knope.
Ulee Danssen,I'm Ulee Danssen.
Ulee Danssen,I'm one of the honorees.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, look at your face."
Ulee Danssen,What?
Leslie Knope,It's just so symmetrical.
Ulee Danssen,"Oh, thanks!"
Ulee Danssen,"You know, we all have that in Denmark."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you're from Denmark, of course."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, what part of Denmark are you from?"
Ulee Danssen,I'm from Silkeborg.
Ulee Danssen,You know.
Ulee Danssen,"It's not one of the most perfect places in the world, but I love it, and it loves me."
Ulee Danssen,And look what they've done for me.
Leslie Knope,They made a statue of you!
Ulee Danssen,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Is that goat cheese?
Ulee Danssen,"Good cheese eye, Leslie."
Ulee Danssen,It is made out of goat cheese.
Ulee Danssen,"We have a lot of it, and after tonight's event, they're going to consume me with crackers."
Ulee Danssen,They just love me.
Ulee Danssen,What about your town?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me."
Leslie Knope,And they're trying to kick me out of office.
Leslie Knope,"One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right?"
Ulee Danssen,"I don't, no."
April Ludgate,So you're from Mongolia?
April Ludgate,Will you take me with you when you go back there?
April Ludgate,I love you.
April Ludgate,Did you understand that?
April Ludgate,Did you bring any wolverines?
Andy Dwyer,Say it again.
Andy Dwyer,Say it again.
Lord Covington,Aluminium.
Lord Covington,"Okay, okay."
Lord Covington,You say it.
Lord Covington,You say it.
Lord Covington,You say it.
Andy Dwyer,"It's ""alumilum."""
Lord Covington,"""Alumilum""?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Alumilum!
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Eddie if you'd like me to talk more about the program,  I would be happy to "
Lord Covington,Mmhmm.
Ben Wyatt,"But my wife is receiving an award in just a few minutes, and I really need to get over there."
Lord Covington,"Yes, of course."
Lord Covington,"The thing is, I don't know what I'm doing."
Andy Dwyer,Me neither.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Lord Covington,My family has a huge amount of money.
Lord Covington,"We live in a castle that has 1,000 acres of land."
Lord Covington,"Our hedge maze is so vast, once, I got lost in there for two days."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,That's awesome.
Lord Covington,It was awesome.
Lord Covington,"There was a statue of a lion inside, and I found a yoyo."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, do you do you have it here?"
Ben Wyatt,Guys 
Lord Covington,"The point is, I started this foundation in order to do something good with our money, and I've heard hundreds of charity pitches, and I honestly don't know whether they're good or bad."
Andy Dwyer,"If I may, ours is great."
Lord Covington,Brilliant!
Lord Covington,I'm in.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Are you serious?
Lord Covington,Yeah.
Lord Covington,"I like you, I like music."
Andy Dwyer,"On one condition: I want you to stay here in London with me for no more than three months, to help me get it up and running and tell me what to do."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, that actually may be tough."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, my wife is in the middle of this recall fight, and I really need to"
Lord Covington,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Lord Covington,"No, no, I meant Andy."
Lord Covington,I want Andy to stay.
Andy Dwyer,Is that a goose that just flew by the window?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's a plastic bag."
Andy Dwyer,Did you see that?
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, did I interrupt?"
Andy Dwyer,What are you guys talking about?
Lord Covington,Let's see if it was a goose.
Andy Dwyer,"I think it could have been, honest to God."
Ulee Danssen,"Silkeborg is wonderful, and I am very supported and loved."
Ulee Danssen,"Once, on my birthday, the town trained a reindeer to do a dance for me."
Ulee Danssen,"It was beautiful, and the reindeer was delicious."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,How was your meeting?
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,I'll fill you in later.
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready for your speech?
Leslie Knope,Uh yeah.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Extra,"Thank you, Ulee."
Extra,It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.
Extra,"Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States, Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women."
Leslie Knope,You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're just truly"
Leslie Knope,"You know, I've been a public servant for a long time."
Leslie Knope,And you know how I spend my days?
Leslie Knope,Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.
Leslie Knope,"And I love my town, but you know how they repay me?"
Leslie Knope,By hating me.
Leslie Knope,They hate me.
Leslie Knope,They want to recall me.
Leslie Knope,I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.
Ulee Danssen,You're always welcome in Silkeborg!
Ulee Danssen,"Olga, let's start a statue of Leslie."
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,"They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there."
Leslie Knope,"I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks."
Leslie Knope,"The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I'm sick of it."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is filled with a bunch of peepee-heads.
Leslie Knope,Thank you very much for this amazing award.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry I said ""peepee-heads."""
April Ludgate,Whoo!
April Ludgate,That's my boss!
Ben Wyatt,"That speech was a little rough, don't you think?"
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, it's how I feel."
Leslie Knope,"Stupid, ungrateful town."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away."
Leslie Knope,Hello.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, it's Jerry."
Leslie Knope,Jerry who?
Jerry Gergich,Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Jer oh, Jerry."
Leslie Knope,"Jerry, why are you calling me?"
Leslie Knope,I don't want to waste my international minutes.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee."
Jerry Gergich,Everyone saw it.
Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, ""everyone""?"
Jerry Gergich,"I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced."
Jerry Gergich,"She's calling it the ""Peepee-head"" speech."
Leslie Knope,"Bloody hell, Jerry!"
Jerry Gergich,So how's Lond
Chris Traeger,I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.
Chris Traeger,It's a very special day.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,"Hi, Donna."
Ann Perkins,So
Donna Meagle,You're pregnant.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, man, Tom told you."
Donna Meagle,Nope.
Donna Meagle,"You're drinking decaf coffee, which you usually only do in the afternoon, you're wearing an empire waist dress and loose shoes 'cause your feet are already swelling."
Donna Meagle,"I'd put you at nine, maybe ten weeks."
Chris Traeger,"My goodness, you're observant."
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I am."
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I am."
Donna Meagle,Hmm.
Donna Meagle,When did you make the switch to boxer briefs?
Chris Traeger,Yesterday.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, please stop looking at him."
Leslie Knope,Why are we here?
Ron Swanson,"Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not."
Leslie Knope,Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here."
Ron Swanson,"When your kid screams ""I hate you,"" you don't sink to his level and yell ""I hate you"" back."
Ron Swanson,You have to be the grownup.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,I have to be the grownup.
Leslie Knope,But it's so hard!
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,And nobody ever thanks you.
Ron Swanson,"You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you."
Ron Swanson,"And by the way, April thanked you."
Ron Swanson,She nominated you for this award.
Leslie Knope,"Well, April does that all the time."
Leslie Knope,She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.
Ron Swanson,"April respects you, and so do many others."
Ron Swanson,Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.
Ron Swanson,That way lies madness.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I almost forgot."
Leslie Knope,"I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many."
Ron Swanson,A train ticket?
Ron Swanson,You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you do."
Leslie Knope,"If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed."
Ron Swanson,"Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen?"
Leslie Knope,"This is London, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops."
Ron Swanson,"Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, Jerry."
Chris Traeger,I didn't know you were working today.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, Ron asked me to come in while he's away."
Jerry Gergich,"Of course, I had to cancel my cardiologist appoint--"
Chris Traeger,That's great.
Chris Traeger,"Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting."
Chris Traeger,"Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God, that's wonderful news!"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, there's so much in front of you."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, soon you're gonna start showing, and then your clothes will feel tight, and then, oh, people are gonna start rubbing your tummy all the time!"
Ann Perkins,That sounds terrible.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Gayle, she got really queasy, and I gained a lot of sympathy weight."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"You know, actually, before my kids, I looked a lot like you, Chris."
Chris Traeger,I'm very sad.
Chris Traeger,Please stop talking.
Jerry Gergich,"And, of course, pretty soon, Ann, your milk is gonna come in."
Ann Perkins,Ohh.
Jerry Gergich,That is exciting.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,"Yep, and it happens sooner than you'd think."
Jerry Gergich,The babies can sense it.
Jerry Gergich,"You would be shocked, 'cause they are rooting around for that nipple."
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm."
Jerry Gergich,"Gimme, gimme."
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm."
Jerry Gergich,I want milk!
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm, mm."
Jerry Gergich,Ohh.
Jerry Gergich,Life is a miracle.
Jerry Gergich,"Mm, mm, mm."
April Ludgate,So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I guess."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I can't do it, obviously."
April Ludgate,Why?
Andy Dwyer,I don't even know what I would be doing.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, besides, this is England."
Andy Dwyer,Everything is so weird.
Andy Dwyer,It's all different.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road."
Andy Dwyer,Do they?
Andy Dwyer,I'll be damned.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, like that."
Andy Dwyer,That's what I'm exactly what I'm talking about.
Andy Dwyer,Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to?
Andy Dwyer,Not even a circus.
Andy Dwyer,"There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns."
Andy Dwyer,One bearded lady.
Andy Dwyer,She got all rude when I marveled at her.
April Ludgate,Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, he's awesome."
Andy Dwyer,He's everything you would want in a boss.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny."
Andy Dwyer,Total package.
April Ludgate,I think you should do it.
April Ludgate,When are you gonna have another opportunity like this?
Andy Dwyer,I mean
April Ludgate,"And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Remember, I was in Washington last year."
Andy Dwyer, He said he wanted me to head up the company.
Andy Dwyer, I have no idea how to run a nonprofit.
April Ludgate, Hey.
April Ludgate, You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.
April Ludgate," Come on, you can hack this."
April Ludgate, I believe in you.
April Ludgate," But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies."
Andy Dwyer, Seems like the only logical solution.
Chris Traeger," My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant."
Chris Traeger, And I'm the baby daddy!
Ethel Beavers,How wonderful for you.
Chris Traeger, You don't seem very excited for us.
Ethel Beavers," I barely know you, and I don't have to talk to you unless it's about work."
Ann Perkins," Man, I thought this would be more satisfying."
Chris Traeger, I agree.
Chris Traeger," Wait a minute, what time is it? Has she landed yet?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days."
Leslie Knope," This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race."
Leslie Knope," I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go."
Leslie Knope, I am not gonna let you go.
Chris Traeger," Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work."
Leslie Knope," Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods."
Ann Perkins, That's for a hangover.
Leslie Knope," Right, yeah, of course."
Leslie Knope, I'm so goofed-up right now.
Leslie Knope, I'm so jet-lagged.
Leslie Knope," I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called ""Zapvigil,"" which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake."
Leslie Knope," So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab."
Leslie Knope," Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding."
Leslie Knope, I know it's Ann.
Chris Traeger, We are so glad you're back.
Chris Traeger," We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for."
Ann Perkins," And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones."
Leslie Knope,Ohh.
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, welcome home!"
Leslie Knope,Don't pinch me!
Tom Haverford,"Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting."
Tom Haverford, It's really a dream come true.
Tom Haverford," Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Tom, lawyer guy daddy Tom did not screw me out of the company."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening."
Dr. Saperstein," So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Daddy-D! Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time! All those math camps I said I went to? I don't even know what a math camp is!"
Dr. Saperstein,"So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Trophies I bought
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,I also have something to say.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein," I have done nothing wrong, ever, in my life."
Dr. Saperstein, I know this and I love you.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein," I love you too, daddy."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein," Money, please! My money."
Tom Haverford,"Dr. Saperstein, your son is my best friend."
Dr. Saperstein,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,He's like a brother to me.
Tom Haverford," But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mm.
Tom Haverford, On an island
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Ooh.
Tom Haverford,In space.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hold on
Dr. Saperstein,These two have been huge disappointments to me.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Come on, you love us."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein, Dad!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"But seriously, what are we doing here, though?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What are we doing here, dad?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Like, what is this?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why are we here?
Tom Haverford,So So now you know the truth.
Tom Haverford, Will you back off?
Dr. Saperstein,"No, I will not stop."
Dr. Saperstein," Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now."
Dr. Saperstein," Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time? No, I'm not gonna back off."
Dr. Saperstein," I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you! All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yes, daddy."
Dr. Saperstein, Huh? Blow me a kiss.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, Mwah!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Mwah.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, - Caught it.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein," I love you, daddy!"
Dr. Saperstein,Me too.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I love you, daddy!"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, we'll be fine."
April Ludgate, Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here?
Leslie Knope,April
April Ludgate,What? I don't trust him.
April Ludgate, I never have.
April Ludgate,He's after your money.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope."
April Ludgate," And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy."
Leslie Knope," Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia."
April Ludgate," Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world."
Leslie Knope," Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs."
Leslie Knope," You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away."
Leslie Knope, Isn't that great?
Gretel,I didn't want all the slugs gone.
Gretel, I wanted most of them gone!
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope," Well, we'll put one slug back."
Leslie Knope," Either way, your problem is solved."
April Ludgate," Oh, my God, that lady is the worst."
April Ludgate, She didn't even say thank you.
Leslie Knope," That's not why we do this, April."
Leslie Knope," We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause."
April Ludgate," Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all."
Leslie Knope, But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs.
Leslie Knope, All right.
Leslie Knope, On to the next complaint.
Ron Swanson," Where the hell are you sending me, Knope?"
Jessica Wicks,"Morning, cutie."
Ben Wyatt,"Morning, Jessica."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Jessica Wicks," These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington."
Jessica Wicks, He was very impressed with you two.
Jessica Wicks, He sounded rich on the phone.
Jessica Wicks, I think he was calling me from a helicopter.
Ben Wyatt, Could be.
Ben Wyatt, He owns two.
Ben Wyatt, So Andy's gonna stay there for three months.
Ben Wyatt, I hope he's okay.
Ben Wyatt, He sent me an email this morning.
Ben Wyatt, I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.
Andy Dwyer," Yeah, this isn't right."
Andy Dwyer, None of this looks familiar.
Andy Dwyer, Eddie?
Jessica Wicks,"Uh-oh, Spaghettios."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust."
Jessica Wicks," No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase."
Jessica Wicks," Oh, my."
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Jessica Wicks," Come on, Sugarbutt!"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, which one's Sugarbutt?"
Jessica Wicks,That's you! Come on.
Jessica Wicks," We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt."
Ben Wyatt, Wildly inappropriate.
Tom Haverford, Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I doubt it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," He never gives up on anything, except for my mom."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," When she turned 30, he was like, ""Get out!"""
Tom Haverford,Maybe I should just throw in the towel.
Tom Haverford, Your dad'll destroy me.
Tom Haverford, I'll be left with nothing.
Tom Haverford, Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg.
Tom Haverford, Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," First of all, unbelievable analogy."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Second of all, what are you talking about, man? You're Tommy Haverford! You're an idea man."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher."
Tom Haverford, You're right.
Tom Haverford," I mean, I'm basically Babyface."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, You're basically Babyface!
Tom Haverford,"Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," That's what I'm talking about! And for me, it's a win-win either way."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You want to come?
Tom Haverford,No!
Ann Perkins,"I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know?"
Chris Traeger,"You know what I just read? Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive."
Chris Traeger, Isn't that wild?
Ann Perkins,It is.
Chris Traeger, A green olive.
Chris Traeger, A little high in sodium.
Chris Traeger, I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato.
Ann Perkins,Our baby's not a salad.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, right."
Ann Perkins," It's just weird, you know? I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing."
Ann Perkins," Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs."
Chris Traeger, It's still just our thing.
Chris Traeger, It'll always be just our thing.
Chris Traeger, That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.
Ann Perkins," You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl."
Chris Traeger," I prefer ""Chickpea."""
Ann Perkins,Because it's lower in sodium?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, exactly."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
April Ludgate,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
April Ludgate, Are you leaving?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase."
Leslie Knope," Let's see, it is ""48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, brother."
April Ludgate," Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you."
April Ludgate," I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours."
April Ludgate," So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face."
April Ludgate,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate, Please sit.
April Ludgate," ""Dear award committee members"" Leslie, I didn't even start."
Leslie Knope," Okay, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope, Go ahead.
April Ludgate," ""Dear award committee members, where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, people who don't care at all about what they do""or how they do it."""
April Ludgate," ""They let the world wash over them and barely notice anyone else is even there."""
April Ludgate," ""Leslie Knope is not one of these people."""
April Ludgate," ""She cares about everything and everyone in our town."""
April Ludgate," ""I don't know how she does it."""
April Ludgate," ""People come to her with the pettiest, stupidest problems, and she cares-- like, really, actually cares-- what happens to them."""
April Ludgate," ""And if you're lucky enough to be her friend, your life gets better every day."""
April Ludgate," ""She spends every waking moment thinking of new ways to make her friends happy."""
April Ludgate," ""There is something wonderful about seeing someone who has found her true purpose on earth."""
April Ludgate," ""For some people, I guess that's being an astronaut or a hot dog-eating champion."""
April Ludgate," ""For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, is making people's lives better."""
April Ludgate," ""That's what I love about her, and that's why she deserves this award."""
April Ludgate," ""Sincerely Satan."""
Leslie Knope,You're getting hugged right now.
April Ludgate," No, I told you not to."
Leslie Knope,I'm giving you a hug.
April Ludgate,No! I told you not to. Stay away!
April Ludgate,No!
Ron Swanson,All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.
Ron Swanson," But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption."
Ron Swanson, This is worth the trip.
Ron Swanson," ""Dear Ron, you have now reached the cliffsides overlooking the islands."""
Ron Swanson," ""As you sit here and gaze upon the waters, please read out loud the poem by the great Scotsman Robert Burns."""
Ron Swanson," ""Love, Leslie."""
Ron Swanson,"""Oh, were my love yon lilac fair, with purple blossoms to the spring, and I, a bird to shelter there, when wearied on my little wing, how I would mourn when it was torn by autumn wild and winter rude, but I would sing on wanton wing, when youthful may its bloom renewed."""
Ron Swanson,I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.
Ben Wyatt,Nice to be home.
Leslie Knope,It is.
Leslie Knope," But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing."
Leslie Knope," And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing."
Ben Wyatt, Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.
Leslie Knope," Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it."
Leslie Knope," Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons."
Ben Wyatt," You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts."
Ben Wyatt," We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us."
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Oh, there's one more thing I want to try."
Ben Wyatt, Mm.
Leslie Knope, I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Wear it for me.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Ben Wyatt, All right.
Ben Wyatt, What's up?
Leslie Knope,"No, not sexy."
Leslie Knope, Failed experiment.
Leslie Knope, Take it off.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just-- okay."
Leslie Knope,Just take it off.
Leslie Knope, No.

Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here's the text I added a few more jokes, slamming Eagleton at the end."
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,That's the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Leslie Knope,I'm so glad you're on my team.
Ben Wyatt,Are you sure you wanna attack 'em at this press conference?
Ben Wyatt,It's a friendly wager on a high school basketball game.
Leslie Knope,"I'm losing the recall election, Ben."
Leslie Knope,Slamming Eagleton is the easiest way to score some points.
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,Am I proud of it?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Because Eagleton sucks.
Leslie Knope,But is it the classiest move?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,Would I do it again?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks."
Leslie Knope,"This year, we get to host the Pawnee Eagleton tipoff classic."
Leslie Knope,That awful human being is Ingrid de Forest.
Leslie Knope,She's a city councilor from Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,She thinks she's so great because she won the Miss Indiana Beauty Pageant.
Leslie Knope,Last year.
Leslie Knope,While she was in office.
Leslie Knope,And pregnant.
Leslie Knope,"As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard."
Ingrid de Forest,"Ew, pesticide."
Ingrid de Forest,Yuck.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, these are pesticide free."
Leslie Knope,"I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it."
Leslie Knope,"So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now."
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, Leslie, I think we had similar ideas."
Ingrid de Forest,"If you win, Eagleton will give you this basket of oranges."
Ingrid de Forest,"Of course, it's silly to compare apples and oranges, but what the heck."
Ingrid de Forest,"These are made of Swarovski crystal, and they're worth 700,000 dollars."
Extra,"Leslie, you're down 15 points in the latest poll for the recall election."
Extra,What can you do to make up the deficit?
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what I'd do if I was an Eagletonian.
Leslie Knope,I'd pop a Xanax and ask my butler to help me out.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I'm not saying that Eagletonians are out of touch."
Leslie Knope,"But when you tell 'em it's time to change their oil, they ask, ""Extra virgin or white truffle?"""
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, guys."
Leslie Knope,I'll see ya at the game.
Leslie Knope,"Unless, of course, you're an Eagletonian, and then you'll be too busy polishing your monocle at the caviar store."
Leslie Knope,Knope out.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,Who or what is Penny Saver?
Tom Haverford,It's a free circular with a bunch of coupons in it.
Ron Swanson,"This was sent to Ron Swanson at Diane's address, where I've lived for less than a month."
Ron Swanson,How is that possible?
Ron Swanson,This is an extreme invasion of privacy.
Ron Swanson,The right to privacy is very important to me.
Ron Swanson,My family has had a single P.O. box for several generations.
Ron Swanson,"We only ever subscribe to two magazines, Reader's Digest and Ebony."
Ron Swanson,"Ebony was due to a clerical error, but it ended up being an interesting year of reading."
Ron Swanson,"I don't know how this was delivered to me, but it cannot happen again."
Ron Swanson,How can I stop it?
Tom Haverford,Mm.
Tom Haverford,Donna is great with this sort of thing.
Tom Haverford,"She got me off the Williams-Sonoma mailing list, but then I just signed back up again."
Tom Haverford,Hooked on their oven mitts.
Tom Haverford,I need my mitts on those mitts.
Ron Swanson,Let me know the second Donna returns.
Tom Haverford,"According to her Twitter feed, she got coffee five minutes ago."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, now she's Ustreaming her walk back."
Tom Haverford,"She should be here in three, two, one."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, hey."
Donna Meagle,"Hey, hey."
Tom Haverford,"Hashtag quest for coffee, blowin' up my timeline."
Tom Haverford,You get my snapchat about it?
Donna Meagle,No.
Tom Haverford,What?
Donna Meagle,There it is.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
Chris Traeger,I did.
Chris Traeger,Think fast.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey Dr. Buttons I mean, my old calculator."
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't have a name.
Ben Wyatt,Why did you throw this at me?
Chris Traeger,"I just got off the phone with our old boss from Indianapolis, and apparently there may be some sort of a budget problem in Eagleton."
Chris Traeger,He asked if maybe you and I wouldn't have a look.
Chris Traeger,You in?
Ben Wyatt,"Butch Countsidy and the Sumdance Kid, together again."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,Hmm.
Chris Traeger,Auditing bros!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and auditing sistah."
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you're coming?"
Leslie Knope,"If there's a problem with Eagleton, I wanna be there."
Leslie Knope,That's like a dream come true.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I have a new routine I'm working on."
Leslie Knope,"Kind of like a Jeff Foxworthy type thing, but about Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"If you make your omelet out of Faberge eggs,  you just might"
Chris Traeger,Be an Eagletonian.
Ann Perkins,Yippee!
Ann Perkins,Road trip!
Ann Perkins,Who's excited to go to Bloomington?
April Ludgate,Is that where you're gonna sit?
Ann Perkins,I'm driving.
Ann Perkins,Where else would I sit?
April Ludgate,Trunk.
Ann Perkins,"I helped April get into vet school in Bloomington and today's her orientation, so we're taking a little road trip."
Ann Perkins,"While I'm there, I'm also gonna pick up an organic baby blanket."
Ann Perkins,"I would get one in Pawnee, but fun fact our only baby store is attached to a chemical refinery."
Ann Perkins,I made a special road trip mix CD for us.
Ann Perkins,I hope you like Tori Amos.
April Ludgate,"Oh, cool."
Leslie Knope,"It really is a pleasure to see you in this context, Ingrid."
Leslie Knope,Say cheese.
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,You look beautiful.
Chris Traeger,Can you give us a little more information surrounding the deficits that you're running this year?
Ingrid de Forest,"Ooh, gosh."
Ingrid de Forest,We don't really like to talk about money.
Ingrid de Forest,We find a little gauche.
Ben Wyatt,This is a budget meeting.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, most of our files are in these boxes if you really wanna take a look at how much that we've spent."
Chris Traeger,Why don't we just dig in and see what we're up against?
Ingrid de Forest,Yes.
Ingrid de Forest,And thank you.
Ingrid de Forest,We really appreciate your help.
Ben Wyatt,Are you tipping me?
Leslie Knope,Is that 100 Euros?
Ron Swanson,People ought to have the right to be left alone.
Ron Swanson,I wanna get completely off the grid.
Donna Meagle,That's crazy talk.
Donna Meagle,I live for the grid.
Donna Meagle,It's where I meet 40% of my jumpoffs.
Tom Haverford," And if you're off the grid, how are you gonna post photos of the dope food at restaurants you're at and all the cool places you're stuntin' in?"
Ron Swanson,Food is for eating.
Ron Swanson,Places are for being.
Ron Swanson,End of discussion.
Tom Haverford,"Don't leave the grid, Ron."
Tom Haverford,The grid is the best.
Tom Haverford,"If anything, you need to get more on the grid."
Tom Haverford,"Grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid"
Donna Meagle,"Grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid"
Ron Swanson,"If you help me get off the grid, I will let both of you go home early."
Tom Haverford,"No grid, no grid, no grid, no grid."
Donna Meagle,"No grid, no grid, no grid, no grid."
Ann Perkins,"All right, so you have everything you need for orientation?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, an empty Sprite can, an old man's fingernail in my pocket, and a picture of Patrick Ewing on a roller coaster."
April Ludgate,I'm all set.
Ann Perkins,Great.
Ann Perkins,Hi.
Ann Perkins,"My friend here is enrolling in the vet school next month, and she would like to be shown around."
Laura,"Totally, happy to."
Laura,I'm Laura.
April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.
Ann Perkins,"So you go with Laura, who seems really nice and does not deserve to be tortured."
Ann Perkins,And I will come meet up with you after I finish at the baby store.
April Ludgate,Sure you wanna leave me here with her?
April Ludgate,What if I'm a murderer?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, that's funny."
Ben Wyatt,This is worse than I could've imagined.
Ben Wyatt,Their debt to equity ratio is ridonkulous.
Chris Traeger,What a hilarious word.
Chris Traeger,It reminds me of a ridiculous donkey.
Chris Traeger,He's the best.
Leslie Knope,What does this mean for them?
Ben Wyatt,"They were in financial trouble a few years ago, like Pawnee was, but their government just kept borrowing money."
Ben Wyatt,Eagleton is on the brink of an epic financial disaster.
Leslie Knope,Ahh.
Leslie Knope,Now that is the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.
Ben Wyatt,"Really, that?"
Leslie Knope,This is gonna hand me the recall election.
Leslie Knope,I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,Now I get to remind people of that fact as we watch our worst enemy collapse into bankruptcy.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, guess what I get to do after the game now."
Leslie Knope,You pretend you're Ingrid.
Leslie Knope,Let's pretend this box is the basket of apples I bet them on the game.
Ben Wyatt,I see where you're going with this.
Leslie Knope,"No, you don't."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you're gonna ask me  if I like apples"
Leslie Knope, Do you like apples?
Ben Wyatt,"We just watched this movie two nights ago, so"
Leslie Knope,Do you like apples?
Ben Wyatt,I don't wanna do this.
Leslie Knope,How about them apples?
Ron Swanson,"Paul, if you ever see another one of these with my name on it, I want you to drive into the woods and bury it."
Extra,"I don't decide who gets mail, sir."
Extra,I just deliver it.
Ron Swanson,Passing the buck the last refuge of the cowardly and blackhearted.
Extra,That seems harsh.
Ron Swanson,Get out.
Donna Meagle,We got rid of your cell phone.
Donna Meagle,This is your last credit card.
Donna Meagle,Are you sure you want me to cut up this card?
Donna Meagle,It gets you into the parking garage.
Ron Swanson,"I'll be taking the bus now, and I'll be paying in cash."
Ron Swanson,What other traces of me exist in the world?
Ron Swanson,"Think, people."
Tom Haverford,"Isn't there a photo of you up at JJ's Diner, from that time when you aah!"
Ron Swanson,"Come on, Tom!"
Ann Perkins,This place is unbelievable.
Ann Perkins,"It has everything I need: Video monitors, leadfree pacifiers."
Ann Perkins,These are the first bibs I've ever seen without Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s face on them.
Extra,Really?
Ann Perkins,April?
Ann Perkins,"Excuse me, sorry."
Ann Perkins,"April, why aren't you at orientation?"
April Ludgate,"Um, I was at orientation, but it was lame, so I left."
April Ludgate,"And then I kept walking, and now here I am."
Ann Perkins,"We are going back there right now, young lady."
April Ludgate,Mmmm.
Ann Perkins,Come on.
April Ludgate,"God, get off me, stranger."
Ingrid de Forest,I'm so sorry we're late.
Ingrid de Forest,We came from our bankruptcy brunch.
Ingrid de Forest,"And Michael Buble played, but he ran a little long."
Chris Traeger,I love Michael Buble.
Ben Wyatt,Was a bankruptcy brunch the best idea?
Ingrid de Forest,"Sure, let's not have brunch like animals."
Chris Traeger,"Well, um, some of these expenditures are questionable."
Chris Traeger,"Uh, you filled the public pools with bottled water?"
Ingrid de Forest,Total body hydration.
Ben Wyatt,What is this here?
Ben Wyatt,This massive expenditure from public works?
Ingrid de Forest,"Ah, yes."
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, yes."
Ingrid de Forest,We purchased HBO for the whole town.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.
Ben Wyatt,You spent government money on a TV subscription?
Ingrid de Forest,It's not TV.
Chris Traeger,Alright.
Chris Traeger,"Uh, Leslie's put together a presentation for a financial recovery."
Ingrid de Forest,Great.
Leslie Knope,You may find it very informative.
Leslie Knope,Let's get started with our first slide.
Leslie Knope,"""Well, well, well"" Tsk, tsk, tsk."
Ron Swanson,"JJ, a few months ago, I came in here and began eating eggs."
Ron Swanson,"They were delicious, so I ordered more."
Ron Swanson,"Before long, I believe I had eaten"
JJ,51 eggs in 20 minutes.
JJ,Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.
JJ,The last ten were still in the shell.
Tom Haverford,"It was a JJ's Diner record, and you took his picture."
Tom Haverford,"Now, we need that picture, for privacy reasons."
JJ,"Okay, but I don't know how anybody would know it's you."
JJ,We followed your instructions.
Ron Swanson,That's too much information.
Ron Swanson,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,Where are we going now?
Ron Swanson,I've eaten a lot of food in a lot of restaurants.
Ron Swanson,Why is everyone else so bad at eating?
April Ludgate,I only agreed to come back here because of our deal.
April Ludgate,Do you promise to play along?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
April Ludgate,Do you?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Laura,"Hi, you're back."
April Ludgate,Hello again.
April Ludgate,"As you remember, I'm April, and this is Ann, my 65 year old grandmother."
Ann Perkins,"Yes, that's who I am."
Ann Perkins,"Anyway, we'd love to hear about Bloomington."
Ann Perkins,It seems like a real hip kind of college town.
April Ludgate,"Meemaw, God, no one uses the word hip anymore."
April Ludgate,Sometimes I wish you went down on the Titanic with all your sorority sisters.
Laura,I would be happy to show you guys around the campus.
Laura,Is there anything in particular that you wanna see?
April Ludgate,How are your local graveyards?
April Ludgate,I have some planning to do.
Leslie Knope,"""You blew it."""
Leslie Knope,"""Super hard."""
Leslie Knope,"""Complete buffoonery."""
Leslie Knope,"""It's hilarious."""
Leslie Knope,"And ""You deserve it."""
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you think you might wanna take it easy on them a little bit?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, like they took it easy on us when they stole all our money and seceded from our town?"
Ben Wyatt,That was 200 years ago.
Ben Wyatt,Cool it.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'll skip ahead.
Ingrid de Forest,Do you have a plan that will help us or not?
Ingrid de Forest,We have borrowed absolutely everything we can from the state.
Ingrid de Forest,"And really, Pawnee is our only hope."
Leslie Knope,We do have a plan.
Leslie Knope,"We are willing to provide a bridge loan for 50,000 dollars."
Leslie Knope,"25% interest, compounded monthly."
Leslie Knope,And you need to release a statement that says that Pawnee rules and Eagleton drools.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, now you're just being nasty."
Ingrid de Forest,"I understand that our towns have a complicated history, but we have a saying in Eagleton ""You don't kick a dressage horse after a failed pas de deux."""
Leslie Knope,"Whatever, blondie."
Leslie Knope,"Your butler made your bed, now you gotta lie in it."
Leslie Knope,"And if you walk out that door, none of us here, and I repeat, none of us will ever help you again."
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."
Chris Traeger,They have Michael Buble on retainer.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, all public photos of me recovered."
Ron Swanson,Nameplate removed from my office door.
Ron Swanson,Pediatrician files confiscated and destroyed.
Ron Swanson,Anything I'm missing?
Tom Haverford,"Great news, Ron."
Tom Haverford,JeanRalphio loves your shirt.
Ron Swanson,What the hell are you talking about?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, I've been taking pictures of you all day for my new Facebook album: ""Ron Swan: Gettin' off the grid."""
Ron Swanson,"Tom, do you maybe see a problem with what you've done?"
Tom Haverford,I do now.
Tom Haverford,"Yes, sorry."
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase.
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,What the hell is happening?
Tom Haverford,I think you accidentally opened up Vine.
Tom Haverford,"You just vined your first selfie, Ron."
Donna Meagle,And I'm vining you vine your selfie.
Ron Swanson,The world is a nightmare.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Ron Swanson,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Tom Haverford,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Donna Meagle,Erase all pictures of Ron!
Laura,The Bline is a cool outdoor trail that cuts right through downtown.
April Ludgate,"She said the Bline is cool, Meemaw."
April Ludgate,Cool means good.
Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Laura, for showing us around."
Laura,Sure.
Laura,"See you in a couple weeks, April."
Ann Perkins,See?
Ann Perkins,This place is great.
Ann Perkins,Aren't you glad we came back and talked to her?
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,It was pointless.
April Ludgate,I'm not going to school here.
Ann Perkins,"April, don't flake out on this."
Ann Perkins,You're gonna love it here.
Ann Perkins,Bloomington is great.
Ann Perkins,It's got culture and music and tons of youngsters.
Ann Perkins,Youngsters?
Ann Perkins,Am I 65 years old?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'm not going here."
April Ludgate,I don't want to.
April Ludgate,Let's leave.
Leslie Knope,Think fast.
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,Why do people keep assuming I'm ready to catch things?
Chris Traeger,"""Eagleton: No money, mo' problems."""
Leslie Knope,"Fantastic, right?"
Leslie Knope,I made enough of them for everybody to wear at the game.
Chris Traeger,I do like a good internal rhyme.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, you ready for dinner?"
Leslie Knope,We can go over the poll numbers.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh you know, I've got a few phone calls to make."
Ben Wyatt,Can you give me an hour?
Leslie Knope,I can meet you there.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What is she doing here?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but you didn't really help them very much, so we volunteered to give them a little financial advice."
Ingrid de Forest,You didn't actually help us at all.
Ben Wyatt,Just one second.
Ingrid de Forest,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just gonna help them out, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,Just for an hour.
Ingrid de Forest,He's just being a good neighbor.
Ingrid de Forest,"We're in a lot of trouble, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"I don't need any lip from you, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You're in trouble because of your own stupidity.
Ingrid de Forest,I have a PhD from the Sorbonne.
Leslie Knope,For what?
Leslie Knope,Wearing Chanel suits?
Ingrid de Forest,"There was a fashion component, yes."
Leslie Knope,I'm not mad that you're doing this.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am mad that you're doing this."
Leslie Knope,"But even worse, I'm mad that you just  lied to me about it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,"We all swore that we weren't gonna ever help her again, ever."
Ben Wyatt,I never said that.
Ben Wyatt,You did.
Leslie Knope,I speak for all of us in all matters.
Leslie Knope,That is what you tacitly agreed to  when you married me.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, let's go."
Leslie Knope,You've changed your mind.
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna help her anymore.
Ingrid de Forest,"Leslie, I just wanna borrow your husband for the evening."
Ann Perkins,Can we please talk about what happened back there?
April Ludgate,"What, Ann?"
April Ludgate,I just stole your phone and texted every guy in it that the baby was theirs.
April Ludgate,It's not that big of a deal.
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know you don't believe this, but I care about your future."
Ann Perkins,And I'm just a little disappointed that you're just not following through with this.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's not about following through, okay?"
April Ludgate,I was on the fence about whether I wanted to do it.
April Ludgate,"And as soon as I got there, I just had a gut feeling that it wasn't right for me, that's all."
Ann Perkins,"So, just like that, boom huge life decision made?"
April Ludgate,That's how I make all my life decisions.
April Ludgate,"My gut is always right, okay?"
April Ludgate,"It was right about marrying Andy, and it was right when it told me that you would be the worst person I would ever meet in my life."
April Ludgate,"And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann."
April Ludgate,So gross!
Ann Perkins,How do you get your gut to talk to you?
April Ludgate,You don't get your gut to talk to you.
April Ludgate,You just listen when it says something.
Ann Perkins,"Well, right now my gut is saying that we are going to listen to Mariah Carey the whole way home."
April Ludgate,Good.
Leslie Knope,Whoa.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, I'm really surprised you're sitting on this side of the bleachers and not on the Eagleton side with your new girlfriend Ingrid."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I'm just trying to help them."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,They wouldn't help us if the tables were turned.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, they're 50 points ahead, and they're still dunking."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, look at this guy."
Leslie Knope,There's no way he is in high school.
Extra,"And I'm better at French horn too, Eric."
Ben Wyatt,"People are gonna lose their jobs, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,And the recovery will take years.
Ben Wyatt,"Deep down, I think you feel bad for them."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I do a little, yes."
Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry that I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope,"With all the recall stuff happening, I just really need to feel like you're on my team, and seeing you with them made me feel like you weren't."
Ben Wyatt, I'm always gonna be on your team.
Ben Wyatt, You never have to worry about that.
Extra, Defense!
Extra,"Oh! Eagleton player number seven, injured on the play."
Extra, Official time-out.
Leslie Knope," Oh, God."
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna say something.
Leslie Knope," And if I throw up on you after I say it, just know that you've been warned."
Leslie Knope, I know how we can help Eagleton.
Ron Swanson, I don't see what the problem is.
Ron Swanson, I will give you a certain amount of gold in exchange for a recreational vehicle.
Extra, I still need an address for insurance purposes.
Ron Swanson, This will be my new home.
Ron Swanson, The address is wherever it is parked.
Diane Lewis," Where have you been? I had a flat tire, and I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours."
Ron Swanson," Sorry, darling."
Ron Swanson, I've been busy destroying most of my personal effects and threatening a postal worker.
Diane Lewis," Ron, I know you value your privacy, but you are a husband and a father now."
Diane Lewis, You can't just roam the streets in an RV and be impossible to find.
Ron Swanson, I'm on a mission to get off the grid.
Diane Lewis," Well, you don't have to be entirely on the grid, but have to be on our grid."
Ron Swanson, I suppose you wouldn't consider moving.
Ron Swanson, I've heard the school system in the tunnels beneath Yucca Mountain is adequate.
Diane Lewis," I love you, but your solution to every problem is to live inside a mountain."
Ron Swanson, I love you too.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, one more time."
Ben Wyatt," Are you absolutely sure you wanna go through with this? A lot of people are gonna get angry, and you might lose the recall election."
Leslie Knope," Or, if I pull it off, I just might win."
Leslie Knope," Plus, a very smart member of my team pointed out it's the right thing to do."
Leslie Knope, Good morning.
Leslie Knope," After an all-night strategy session, the towns of Pawnee and Eagleton have come up with a potential solution to Eagleton's budget crisis."
Leslie Knope, The town of Eagleton will be dissolved and re-absorbed into Pawnee.
Leslie Knope," Pawnee will provide some government services, as well as taking on some of Eagleton's debts."
Leslie Knope, I understand.
Leslie Knope," Look, I hate Eagletonians as much as you do."
Leslie Knope, I hate their stupid beautiful faces and their stupid shiny hair.
Chris Traeger, We looked at every alternative.
Chris Traeger, This is the only scenario that prevents Eagleton's financial crisis from spiraling throughout the entire region.
Chance Frenlm, Eagleton is terrible! Why should I bail them out with the hard-earned money from my unemployment check?
Extra,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Because they are our neighbor and they've sprained their ankle.
Leslie Knope," And when your neighbor sprains his ankle, you help him off the court."
Leslie Knope," I understand you have concerns and questions, and we are here to listen to them."
Herman Lerpiss, I got something to say.
Leslie Knope," One at a time, please."
Mel, I hate the one-at-a-time system!
Herman Lerpiss,Why should we bail them out? No one bailed me out when I got arrested for arson.
Extra, You can't just merge two towns.
Extra, It's against the rules of nature.
Extra, What's next-- merging a man with his dog?
Bertram Rolands,I live in Eagleton.
Bertram Rolands," And frankly, I don't like the idea of living in Pawnee."
Bertram Rolands," They're a little-- oh, what's the word? Have-no-money."
Ingrid de Forest," Bertram, that's enough."
Ingrid de Forest," First of all, Eagleton has no money."
Ingrid de Forest," Second of all, they are gracious enough to throw us a lifeline, and we should be eternally grateful for their generosity."
Ingrid de Forest," They're a town of angels-- greasy, denim-clad angels, but angels nonetheless."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, we'll take it."
Donna Meagle," I mean, did you steal this from a museum?"
Donna Meagle,Maybe find it frozen in ice?
Donna Meagle,It looks like the original phone from the movie Wall Street.
Tom Haverford," I think it's just the original phone, period."
Tom Haverford," Ew, gross, it has ""buttons."""
Diane Lewis,"Okay, girls, this is a magic phone, okay? Only you and I have got the numbers."
Diane Lewis," So if you ever need Ron for any reason, you just call and he'll be there in a flash."
Ron Swanson," Yes, I will."
Ron Swanson, I'll keep it right here.
Ron Swanson," It snaps right in, snug and secure."
Tom Haverford," A cell phone belt clip? No, Ron."
Tom Haverford," Oh, my God!"
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I can't be seen with you."
Chris Traeger, Travelin' Ann Perkins! How was Bloomington?
Ann Perkins,It was amazing.
Ann Perkins," They had all the baby supplies we need, and they had all this other cool stuff."
Ann Perkins," They had a bike-sharing program and a vegan Afghan restaurant and-- Oh, my God."
Ann Perkins, I'm having one.
Ann Perkins, - I'm having one right now.
Chris Traeger, - A contraction?
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins," Dude, I'm, like, three months pregnant."
Chris Traeger, I-I know.
Chris Traeger, I'm just so excited.
Ann Perkins, The thing I'm having is a gut feeling.
Ann Perkins, What would you think about raising our child somewhere other than Pawnee?
Ingrid de Forest,"Thank you, Leslie, from all of us in Eagleton."
Ingrid de Forest, Our citizens owe you a debt of gratitude.
Leslie Knope," Well, I think at the end of the day, everybody realizes it's something we have to do."
Ingrid de Forest," On the bright side, we did win the basketball game."
Ingrid de Forest, I think you owe us some apples.
Ingrid de Forest, - You better pay up.
Leslie Knope," - Oh, you don't want them."
Leslie Knope, All of Pawnee's apples have been recalled-- - g. coli.
Ingrid de Forest, - You mean e. Coli?
Leslie Knope,I wish.
Leslie Knope, Way easier to treat.
Leslie Knope, Welcome to Pawnee!

,Season: 6 Episode: 03
Leslie Knope,This is a historic day.
Leslie Knope,"At 12:01 this morning, the city of Eagleton ceased to exist and was reabsorbed back into Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Things are exactly the way they were back in 1817, except, you know, women and minorities can vote, we have indoor toilets, and we no longer burn widows for learning arithmetic."
Chris Traeger,"Councilwoman Knope is your merger czar, and in the binders that she's provided, you will find directions to your department in Pawnee that most closely matches your department in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"There are two Eagleton departments Pawnee does not have: the Department of Infinity Pool Design and the Department of Dressage, which I am told is a fancy horseriding thing."
Extra,"It is horse dancing, madam."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, take it easy, Alonzo."
Leslie Knope,"All you horse dancing people, sit in your saddles if you will."
Leslie Knope,"The rest of you, welcome to your new departments."
April Ludgate,Attention: Eagleton is now under martial law.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Pawnee Parks Department."
Leslie Knope,"Soon, you will be paired up with a person who was roughly your equivalent in Eagleton."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you'll be with Craig."
Leslie Knope,"April, you'll be with someone named Tynnyfer."
Leslie Knope,"And Ron, your guy is also named Ron."
Tom Haverford,Guess there's no Tom Haverford equivalent.
Tom Haverford,"Not surprised, I'm one of a kind, just like the custom Nikes I designed that say ""Tommy's Tootsies"" across the toes."
Leslie Knope,"You do have a counterpart, actually."
Leslie Knope,"His name is Eric, and I've heard he's amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, I also have a little surprise."
Leslie Knope,I would like to introduce our new filing temp.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, everybody."
April Ludgate,No!
Tom Haverford,"No, why?"
Tom Haverford,This can't be happening.
Ron Swanson,"Why, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,We brought Jerry out of retirement because we have a mountain of filing to get through.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome back, Jerry Gergich."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"And as long as we're starting out fresh, Leslie, I was wondering if people would call me by my real name."
April Ludgate,Larry?
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's not Larry."
Jerry Gergich,It's Jerry.
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's Gary."
April Ludgate,"Your name is Larry, Larry Gengurch."
April Ludgate,His name is Larry Gengurch.
Jerry Gergich,"Come on, April, it's already hard enough for my family when you call me ""Gary."""
Jerry Gergich,Jerry.
April Ludgate,"Ha, ha, classic Larry."
Tom Haverford,Larry.
Tom Haverford,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Ron Swanson,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Donna Meagle,"Larry, Larry, Larry."
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, jeez."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I'm trying to save as many jobs as possible, but we're gonna have to lose some people."
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure who we should keep.
Leslie Knope,"April, Tom and Donna are three of the best human beings that have ever lived."
Leslie Knope,Ron is basically a better version of George Washington.
Leslie Knope,But the Eagletonians are probably good too.
Chris Traeger,"Today, we are not just merging two towns."
Chris Traeger,We're throwing a birthday party for a new city.
Chris Traeger,"Happy birthday, New Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Party's over.
Ben Wyatt,"You guys lost millions of taxpayer dollars, and we have to clean up the obscene mess you've made."
Extra,You're not as nice as the other guy.
Ben Wyatt,I don't care.
Chris Traeger,"When we were state auditors, we had an amazing system."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up and made them feel positive and happy."
Ben Wyatt,And I swooped in and slashed their budgets to ribbons.
Chris Traeger,Like a majestic alleyoop.
Chris Traeger,You're all amazing!
Ben Wyatt,You're all fired.
Chris Traeger,Teamwork.
Jerry Gergich,"Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Larry Gengurch."
Jerry Gergich,Please leave your message after the tone.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, when Leslie called to see if I could help, Gayle and I were just getting on a cruise ship to the Bahamas."
Jerry Gergich,"I said, ""Gayle, put that bikini away, because Pawnee needs me."""
Jerry Gergich,Oh ho!
Jerry Gergich,Somebody forgot a banana in here ooh!
Donna Meagle,"Hi, I'm Donna."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, that is the perfect name for you."
Craig Middlebrooks,I love it.
Craig Middlebrooks,Never change it!
Donna Meagle,Wasn't gonna.
Donna Meagle,"You're Craig, right?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Ugh, yes, but I hate that name."
Craig Middlebrooks,It's so boring.
Craig Middlebrooks,Sounds like someone's cousin.
Craig Middlebrooks,Craig!
Craig Middlebrooks,Craig!
Craig Middlebrooks,"I want to be a Spanish man named Terrence, but that didn't happen."
Donna Meagle,Okay.
Donna Meagle,So here's my list of duties.
Donna Meagle,I'm basically the office manager.
Donna Meagle,How about you?
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, I did everything."
Craig Middlebrooks,Everything!
Craig Middlebrooks,"I carried the Eagleton department on my shoulders for years, and I loved every second of it."
Craig Middlebrooks,You don't even know!
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, was your name Jennifer?"
Tynnyfer,"No, it's Tynnyfer with two y's."
Tynnyfer,"I used to be Jennifer, but then I decided to rebrand myself."
Tynnyfer,"Oh, wait, hang on."
Tynnyfer,It's Xanax o'clock.
April Ludgate,"Um, well, nice to meet you."
April Ludgate,"My name's April, and I just wanted to say that your dress is so cute it's bonks."
Tynnyfer,"I saw my spinning instructor wearing it, and I was like, ""Shut up."""
Tynnyfer,Where do I get that?
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Who's your spinning instructor?
April Ludgate,Gregory or Wynona?
Tynnyfer,I go to Yonis.
Tynnyfer,Who are Gregory and Wynona?
Tynnyfer,I've never heard of them before.
Tynnyfer,Are they better?
April Ludgate,Wynona rocks my world.
Tynnyfer,"Seriously, you need to get me in there."
Tynnyfer,"Like, that's a must, must, must."
April Ludgate,She's the worst person I've ever met.
April Ludgate,I want to travel the world with her.
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ron Dunn,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Last name?
Ron Dunn,Dunn.
Ron Swanson,"Is that your name, or are you telling me you're finished talking?"
Run Dunn,Both.
Ron Swanson,Dunn and done.
Ron Swanson,I like Ron.
Ragiv,Hi.
Tom Haverford,"Well, well, well."
Tom Haverford,You must be Eric.
Ragiv,I'm Ragiv from I.T.
Ragiv,This is ERIC.
Tom Haverford,ERIC is a computer program?
Ragiv,Stands for Eagleton Reservation Information Center.
Ragiv,It does all the scheduling in Eagleton.
Ragiv,I'm here to install it.
Tom Haverford,But scheduling's the main part of my job.
Ragiv,You still have a human being in charge of booking tennis courts?
Ragiv,"What is this, 1990?"
Ragiv,I guess that explains the shoulder pads.
Tom Haverford,How did he notice these?
Leslie Knope,"Hey, this is a surprise."
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I just wanted to chat for a sec."
Ann Perkins,"You know, just so you could hear some things from me."
Ann Perkins,Verbal things from my mouth.
Ann Perkins,Did that sound weird?
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, everything's fine."
Ann Perkins,"First of all, this is Evelyn."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello."
Ann Perkins,She is my Health Department counterpart from Eagleton.
Evelyn,There really wasn't a ton of work for me there.
Evelyn,Eagletonians are very healthy.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, this might be a very interesting challenge for you, because Pawnee has the very first documented case of megadiabetes."
Leslie Knope,And the only know occurrence of Lou Gehrig's other disease.
Leslie Knope,We've been written about in textbooks.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Evelyn, I'll see you back in my office."
Ann Perkins,I just need to talk some more words into Leslie's face.
Leslie Knope,Nice to meet you.
Leslie Knope,Ahem.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I feel sorry for her.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, nobody can fill your shoes, Ann."
Leslie Knope,With your tiny little doll feet.
Ann Perkins,"Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about."
Ann Perkins,"I, uh, I'm gonna step down, and I'm gonna turn my job over to Evelyn."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Did somebody put you up to this?
Leslie Knope,Was it Evelyn?
Leslie Knope,I knew she was a monster.
Ann Perkins,No.
Ann Perkins,"No, no, no."
Ann Perkins,"Chris and I have been talking, and we are thinking very seriously about leaving Pawnee and moving somewhere else to start our family"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, look at that."
Ann Perkins,It's waffles!
Ann Perkins,Delicious waffles.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Ann Perkins,Should we try?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, let's try."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Ann Perkins,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what were you saying?"
Ann Perkins,Try.
Ann Perkins,Just enjoy.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,There we go.
Leslie Knope,"So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me you're not thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Ann Perkins,I am thinking about leaving.
Leslie Knope,"Is this one of those classic Ann ""not"" jokes?"
Leslie Knope,"Like, ""I'm leaving Pawnee not!"""
Ann Perkins,I don't do that.
Leslie Knope,I was hoping that you had started.
Ann Perkins,It's not definite.
Ann Perkins,It's just neither of us are from Pawnee.
Ann Perkins,And I have a whole family in Michigan.
Ann Perkins,And Chris is missing life in a bigger city.
Ann Perkins,And I just wanted to talk to you about it so you could hear it from me.
Ann Perkins,Do you hear that galloping?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Ann Perkins,"Wha oh my, my look at that!"
Ann Perkins,Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.
Ann Perkins,That's amazing!
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I've got a ton of work to do."
Leslie Knope,"I'm super busy, so you can let yourself"
Leslie Knope,"Look, if Ann wants to leave Pawnee, I get it."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, who wants to stay in the greatest town in the world with her best friend and be happy forever when she can abandon her soul sister like an old shoe and move to a garbage city full of jerks."
Leslie Knope,I get it.
Leslie Knope,No hard feelings.
Tynnyfer,You have to text me.
April Ludgate,I will.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry for the delay, ladies, I was busy being ambushed by treachery."
Leslie Knope,So did you have a chance to compare notes on your respective duties?
April Ludgate,Totally.
April Ludgate,"Tynny and I have been, like, totally bonding."
April Ludgate,We've just been like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!
April Ludgate,"Like, talking, like, so much forever."
Tynnyfer,It was all so delicious.
April Ludgate,"I know, right?"
Tynnyfer,"This is, like, the best day ever."
April Ludgate,"I know, I'm eating it all up."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,It's nice to see a friendship blossoming instead of wiling away like a dying turd flower.
April Ludgate,Totes.
April Ludgate,"Um, we also came up with these nicknames for each other."
April Ludgate,Slut and Skank.
April Ludgate,"How crazemazing is that, Lez?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what I think is crazemazing?"
Leslie Knope,Commitment.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for someone who's in it for the long haul.
Leslie Knope,"We are basically creating a new version of Pawnee, and if Pawnee is gonna commit to one of you, you need to commit to Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Tynnyfer, do you have kids?"
Tynnyfer,"Ew, no."
Tynnyfer,I've had so much rejuvenation that I don't think a baby could get out of there if it tried.
April Ludgate,You know it.
Donna Meagle,I guess we can make a switch to Bermuda grass.
Donna Meagle,It's only 80 cents more per square foot?
Craig Middlebrooks,What?
Craig Middlebrooks,Gimme gimme gimme.
Craig Middlebrooks,You want me to put Bermuda grass in a continental climate that's a six on Beaufort scale?
Craig Middlebrooks,In a park with zero drainage?
Craig Middlebrooks,"I want Kentucky bluegrass, I want a 10 percent discount, and I want you to apologize to my best friend Donna!"
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, hi."
Donna Meagle,Is there and I'm just guessing here some kind of medication that you maybe need a lot of and have taken none of or maybe too much of today?
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, I have a medical condition all right."
Craig Middlebrooks,It's called caring too much!
Craig Middlebrooks,And it's incurable!
Craig Middlebrooks,Also I have eczema.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me a little about yourself."
Ron Dunn,"Well, I love the outdoors, love nature."
Ron Swanson,Amen.
Ron Dunn,I'm a big believer in environmental conservation.
Ron Dunn,Recycling and composting and the like.
Ron Dunn,I'm a yoga nut.
Ron Dunn,And I'm a nut nut.
Ron Dunn,"They make delicious milks, man."
Ron Dunn,"And I'm a vegan, of course."
Ron Dunn,Slowly working toward full freegan vegan.
Ron Swanson,What in God's name is freegan vegan?
Leslie Knope,You only eat vegetables that have been thrown out in people's dumpsters.
Ron Swanson,"What is on your foot, sir?"
Ron Dunn,My trusty sandals.
Ron Dunn,I believe a man's feet should remain uncaged.
Ron Dunn,Same goes for all chickens.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Eagleton Ron, we here in Pawnee value loyalty above all else."
Leslie Knope,So would you be opposed to signing an official loyalty pledge to our new town?
Ron Dunn,"As long as that new town were open to the ideals of communal living, everyone pitches in towards a common good."
Ron Dunn,"In the immortal words of Cat Stevens, ""If you want to be free, be free."""
Ron Swanson,I no longer like Ron.
Tom Haverford,ERIC is an amazing program.
Tom Haverford,"Fast, fun and easy to use."
Tom Haverford,But there's one thing no man or machine can beat Tom Haverford at talking mad trash till I get what I want.
Tom Haverford,This guy Eric is a disaster.
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,Just a bad attitude.
Tom Haverford,"""Oh, I hate this place."""
Tom Haverford,"""Get me out here."""
Tom Haverford,That kind of thing.
Tom Haverford,And unreliable.
Tom Haverford,And racist.
Tom Haverford,I think he may have even been to jail.
Tom Haverford,"Although, you know, maybe those are just regular face tattoos."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's not good.
Leslie Knope,I should probably talk to him.
Tom Haverford,"Well, let me see if can turn him around."
Tom Haverford,I don't want to put this on your plate.
Tom Haverford,You have a lot to deal with.
Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Tom."
Leslie Knope,You're the best.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's take a look at this list of assets owned by the Eagleton government."
Ben Wyatt,400 Segway scooters.
Ben Wyatt,Sell 'em.
Ben Wyatt,They're gone.
Ben Wyatt,You had six fulltime baristas on the payroll.
Ben Wyatt,The baristas are gone.
Ben Wyatt,As are the masseurs.
Ben Wyatt,And the fulltime barista who provided coffee for the masseurs.
Chris Traeger,It is excellent having the old band back together again.
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,This calls for some celebratory lunges.
Chris Traeger,One two
Leslie Knope,"All right, Donna."
Leslie Knope,There's gonna have to be some cutbacks.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, your job is secure, of course."
Leslie Knope,You're basically the glue of this department.
Leslie Knope,But I think Craig's gonna have to go.
Donna Meagle,"No, you should keep him."
Donna Meagle,"He's crazy intense, but I've never met anyone who cares more about this job."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Donna, I'm right here."
Donna Meagle,No joke.
Donna Meagle,He might care more than you.
Donna Meagle,"Honestly, if I had to choose between him and me,  I'd choose him."
Leslie Knope,"Wait, what are you saying?"
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking about leaving?
Donna Meagle,"I wasn't planning on it, but I could."
Donna Meagle,"You know, I got the condo in Seattle, the fiance in Denver."
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Donna Meagle,It won't last.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I would be happy to go back into retirement if you have to cut the staff."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Even Larry wants out?
Leslie Knope,What the hell is happening here?
Leslie Knope,Does everybody think that running a town is just some game where people can come and go as they please?
Ann Perkins,"Okeydokey, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,You're mad at me.
Ann Perkins,Don't take it out on everybody else.
Ann Perkins,It's not fair.
Leslie Knope,I'll tell you what's not fair.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to watch the Oscars with Ben alone this year.
Leslie Knope,"Last year, don't you remember Angelina Jolie and the leg dress moment?"
Leslie Knope,"He had, and I quote, ""no comment."""
Leslie Knope,How can you not have an extreme reaction about a dress like that?
Leslie Knope,It just doesn't make any sense!
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we need to talk."
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Leslie Knope,I can't understand you.
Leslie Knope,You've developed some accent from that new town you might move to!
Leslie Knope,It seems like no one around here understands the meaning of loyalty.
Leslie Knope,I am the merger czar.
Leslie Knope,I make the rules.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna teach people the meaning of loyalty in a language they will understand-- complicated legalese.
Ron Swanson,"Knope, what are these contracts?"
Leslie Knope,It's just a little something that I drew up for all the employees of the new town.
Leslie Knope,"Basic boilerplate language, 50 year commitment, blah, blah, blah."
April Ludgate,"I'm so sorry, honey, but Tynny and I won't sign anything until we speak with our life coach."
Tom Haverford,"When Eric saw this, he smashed a bunch of computers."
Ron Swanson,Why are you doing this?
Leslie Knope,What's the big deal?
Leslie Knope,I'm just trying to stop time with legally binding friendship contracts.
Leslie Knope,What part of that do you not understand?
Ron Swanson,You have lost your mind.
April Ludgate,"I think you need a spa day, Les."
Leslie Knope,Fine!
Leslie Knope,You only have to work here until I'm dead!
Leslie Knope,Is that better?
Ron Swanson,What in the name of all that is holy is that smell?
Ron Dunn,Yerba matte tea.
Ron Dunn,Sweetened with stevia.
Ron Dunn,It's an allnatural plant extract.
Ron Swanson,Shut your damn mouth.
Ron Dunn,No need to curse.
Ron Swanson,There most certainly is.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, all Eagleton people meet me in the conference room."
Leslie Knope,"All Pawnee people, sit at your desks."
Leslie Knope,And take it personally.
Leslie Knope,"I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow."
Leslie Knope,"However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard."
Leslie Knope,But do not worry.
Leslie Knope,"I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out."
Leslie Knope,Mmm!
Leslie Knope,Sugar mustard.
Ron Dunn,"That's awful kind of you, Leslie, but I'm afraid those are a little too sweet for me."
Ron Dunn,I unhooked from that big sugar train over 30 years ago.
Leslie Knope,"You are a man of principle and I respect that, cool Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, what's your story, new Ann?"
Leslie Knope,You're kind of pretty.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're not ""Ann"" pretty, but you have potential."
Evelyn,"Thank you, but I don't work in this department."
Leslie Knope,"Shut your kind of pretty mouth and, uh, eat a mustard cookie."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so let's chitchat, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other and then become familiar best friends.
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't have time for this.
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm halfway through designing a bamboo gazebo as a tribute to the founders of Motown.
Leslie Knope,That's so Craig.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Craig!"
Leslie Knope,"We have fun, don't we?"
Leslie Knope,"Do you guys remember when this all started and I came in here with the cookies, and then Craig said something so Craig and we all laughed, and we were like, ""Craig!"""
Leslie Knope,Do you think it would be weird if we held hands?
Leslie Knope,Probably.
Ron Swanson,"This way, please."
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, Ron, I am talking to my best friends."
Leslie Knope,Let me go!
Leslie Knope,"Best friends, attack Ron!"
Chris Traeger,"Ben, it has been an honor watching you work today."
Chris Traeger,It's been like watching Leonardo work.
Chris Traeger,Da Vinci or DiCaprio.
Chris Traeger,You're that good.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks, man."
Ben Wyatt,I was in the zone today.
Ben Wyatt,This really has been a lot of fun.
Ben Wyatt,The old juice is back!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, should we keep this going?"
Ben Wyatt,"Celebratory dinner, just like the old days?"
Chris Traeger,"Ben, that's a great idea."
Chris Traeger,"Hey, you know what?"
Chris Traeger,I know who I'm gonna use to calculate tax and tip.
Ben Wyatt,Me?
Tynnyfer,Can I just say something?
Tynnyfer,I'm having so much fun right now.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, me too."
April Ludgate,"Like, so much fun."
April Ludgate,"Can I just say something, though?"
Tynnyfer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,You don't want this job.
April Ludgate,"Seriously, this place is the pits."
April Ludgate,"It's like, if you worked here, you'd be like, ""Ugh!"""
April Ludgate,"And Leslie would be like, ""Blah, blah, blah."""
April Ludgate,"And you'd be like, ""Uh"""
Tynnyfer,"Okay, can I say something?"
Tynnyfer,"Right now, I totally think that you're right, and I had been thinking about going someplace warm while my husband is in jail."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,Can I just say something?
Tynnyfer,Yes!
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,You should totally stay at my house in Miami.
Tynnyfer,What?
April Ludgate,I'm serious.
April Ludgate,Come by anytime.
April Ludgate,Just let yourself in.
April Ludgate," The gate kind of jams sometimes, but you can just jump it."
Tynnyfer, You are so amazing right now.
Tynnyfer, You're like skinny Mother Theresa.
April Ludgate, It's Dwayne Wade's house.
April Ludgate, I got his address off the Internet.
April Ludgate, I really hope he's there when she walks in and he throws a basketball at her head.
Ron Swanson," Okay, enough is enough."
Ron Swanson," What is wrong with you, woman?"
Leslie Knope,I don't need to explain myself to you! I am the czar.
Leslie Knope, I can do as I please.
Leslie Knope, Those who cross the czar feel the wrath of the czar! Ann is thinking about leaving Pawnee.
Leslie Knope," Moving, with Chris."
Ron Swanson," Well, that's nice."
Leslie Knope," Nice, Ron? Edible arrangements are nice."
Leslie Knope," This is volcanically hot betrayal! She is my best friend! She's thinking about leaving, just like that!"
Leslie Knope,"And she wants to ""talk to me"" about it? It's like, I don't even know what to say."
Ron Swanson," That you love her and you understand that it's her life, and geography will never change your feelings."
Leslie Knope, Whatever.
Leslie Knope, I don't even need her.
Leslie Knope," I've got Tynnyfer now, and Craig, and Eric, the racist drug dealer who I've yet to meet."
Leslie Knope, Those are my real friends.
Ron Swanson," You can't force friendship, Leslie."
Ron Swanson, It takes time.
Ron Swanson, I once thought I had a friend.
Ron Swanson, Then it turned out he was the single worst person I have ever met.
Ron Dunn," I agree with Ron, Leslie."
Ron Dunn, It's like Moz once said.
Ron Dunn," ""Hold on to your friends."""
Ron Dunn,Morrissey.
Ron Dunn, The Smiths.
Ron Dunn, You don't know Meat Is Murder? It's one of the best songs ever written about industrialized beef consumption.
Leslie Knope," Okay, Eagleton Ron."
Leslie Knope, I think it might be time for you to go.
Leslie Knope," This Ron has the position pretty much locked up, and, uh, I don't think we have any room for you in our department."
Ron Dunn, Fair enough.
Ron Dunn, I should have seen it.
Ron Dunn," Taurus and Capricorns never mix, do they? Just remember, Ron."
Ron Dunn, Giving in to hate is like drinking saltwater.
Ron Dunn, The thirst only grows worse.
Ron Swanson," Leslie, remove this man before I commit an act of violence against him."
Ron Dunn," Whatever you do, I won't fight back."
Tom Haverford," After I defeated him in an epic struggle, ERIC is gone."
Tom Haverford, He's been replaced by T.O.M.
Tom Haverford,Town-wide organizational matrix.
Donna Meagle," Big plans tonight, Craig?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"No, I have a ton of work to do."
Craig Middlebrooks," Plus, my DVR is 13 months pregnant with episodes of Scandal."
Donna Meagle, Scandal's my favorite show.
Donna Meagle," I love every character, except for Mellie."
Craig Middlebrooks, Oh! Of course you like Scandal! Because you're amazing! I love you.
Craig Middlebrooks," And no matter what happens with this job, I will always love you."
Craig Middlebrooks, Excuse me! Who even are you?
Ben Wyatt,How's your salad?
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's called the ""Good Earth Salad,"" but really, it's just cheese, toffee, and gummy bear worms."
Chris Traeger, This town is really unhealthy.
Ben Wyatt," You know, I forgot that this part of being accounting bros was actually pretty depressing."
Ben Wyatt," I mean, after the intense, almost meth-like high of solving accounting puzzles, we were always just beat at the end of the day."
Chris Traeger, I actually think it's something else.
Chris Traeger," Back in the day, this was all we had."
Chris Traeger," We'd go into a town, we'd fix problems."
Chris Traeger, We'd go back to some rundown motel.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, you'd exercise."
Ben Wyatt," I'd re-watch Twin Peaks, then hit the Twin Peaks message boards and read The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer to find Easter Eggs I'd missed."
Chris Traeger," But now, Ann and Leslie are our real partners."
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Ben Wyatt, It's a good thing.
Ben Wyatt, But you were a fine surrogate before we found them.
Chris Traeger," Just so you know, we're thinking of moving."
Chris Traeger, Don't know where yet.
Chris Traeger," Maybe Michigan, to be with Ann's family."
Ben Wyatt, Wow.
Ben Wyatt, That makes me kind of sad.
Ben Wyatt, But also incredibly happy for you and Ann.
Ben Wyatt, We have come a long way.
Chris Traeger, Something healthy! A cherry tomato.
Chris Traeger, Nope.
Chris Traeger, A gumball.
Ben Wyatt, Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"What I really want to say is, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope, You're my best friend.
Leslie Knope, This whole thing is just scary and confusing.
Leslie Knope, I love you.
Leslie Knope," I want to talk about this, all of this, whatever it means."
Leslie Knope, Was that okay?
Evelyn,I guess it's good.
Evelyn," Again, I barely know you or Ann, so I don't have much to go off of."
Leslie Knope,Well
Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie."
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope," Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann."
Leslie Knope, That was six hours well spent.
Leslie Knope, I thank you.
Ann Perkins, Looks like you've made all your decisions.
Leslie Knope," Well, almost."
Ann Perkins, What were you talking to Evelyn about?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope, It's not important.
Leslie Knope, The only thing that's important is you.
Leslie Knope, I'm ready to talk about this.
Leslie Knope, I want to talk about this.
Leslie Knope, Is now a good time?
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Ann Perkins, Now is a great time.

Leslie Knope,"Hey, I've gained a lot of ground in the polls."
Leslie Knope,That's good news.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I have you down only four points, but they're running a ton of new negative ads."
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should fight back.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, your heart's in the right place."
Leslie Knope,Your heart and your butt.
Leslie Knope,I will not go negative.
Leslie Knope,Crap on a turd!
Extra,"Care for a ""Recall Knope"" gift bag?"
Leslie Knope,The committee to recall Leslie Knope is relentless.
Leslie Knope,Look what they're handing out at elementary schools.
Extra,I'm Leslie Knope.
Extra,Tell your parents to recall me.
Leslie Knope,"We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 ""Don't"" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers."
Leslie Knope,"That way, if you see a sign and it says ""Recall Knope,"" all you need to do is add the question mark and the ""Don't,"" and suddenly, it reads, ""Recall Knope? Don't."""
Donna Meagle,"Why don't you just put the ""Don't"" in front of ""Recall Knope""?"
Leslie Knope,"Yep, that's a much better idea."
April Ludgate,Can I have these question mark stickers?
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,I want to put them on stop signs.
Leslie Knope,"April, no!"
Nadia Stasky,Hi.
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I need to talk to somebody about reserving a park."
April Ludgate,"Oh, we have a new policy."
April Ludgate,Parks can only be reserved for witch covens or slip-and-slide competitions.
April Ludgate,Which one are you?
Nadia Stasky,"Uh, slip-and-slide competition."
April Ludgate,Seriously?
Nadia Stasky,No.
Nadia Stasky,Why would you even compete in something like that?
Nadia Stasky,It doesn't matter.
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I called earlier about the free vaccinations thing."
Nadia Stasky,We're hoping to set up a mobile hospital in one of your parks.
Nadia Stasky,"I'm sorry, is there something wrong with him?"
April Ludgate,"Tom, this witch wants to reserve a park for her satanic ritual."
April Ludgate,Can you help her?
Tom Haverford,Right.
Tom Haverford,Smashing.
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yes, I'm Thomas Haverford."
Tom Haverford,I sort of run the whole department.
Tom Haverford,"Um, what was the name, then?"
Nadia Stasky,"Uh, Nadia Stasky."
Nadia Stasky,I'm from Doctors Without Borders.
Tom Haverford,Brilliant.
Tom Haverford,"The old ""D""s without ""B""s."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, we can definitely help."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, Tom's your guy."
April Ludgate,He actually used to run the Parks Department in his home country of Russia.
Tom Haverford,This one is mental.
Tom Haverford,"She's joking, obviously."
Tom Haverford,How could I be from Russia?
Tom Haverford,Not with this spot-on British accent.
Tom Haverford,We can definitely get you sorted.
Tom Haverford,Right this way.
Nadia Stasky,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,I am pretty sure you shouldn't have a weapon at work.
Ron Swanson,"Literally everything is a weapon, son."
Ron Swanson,"That folder, in my hands, is far deadlier than this bow in yours."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's probably true."
Ben Wyatt,"So, Leslie and I just finished putting together our will, and she wants you to be the witness."
Ben Wyatt,You mind signing it?
Ron Swanson,That's your will?
Ron Swanson,"You need that many pages to say, ""Give my stuff to my wife""?"
Ben Wyatt,It's a complicated legal document.
Ron Swanson,It doesn't have to be.
Ron Swanson,I've had the same will since I was eight years old.
Ben Wyatt,"""Upon my death, all of my belongings shall transfer to the man or animal who has killed me."""
Ben Wyatt,What are these weird symbols?
Ron Swanson,The man who kills me will know.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, you should really have a will that's more than one sentence long."
Ben Wyatt,You have a wife and kids now.
Ben Wyatt,I could introduce you to our lawyer.
Ron Swanson,"The three most useless jobs in the world are, in order, lawyer, congressman, and doctor."
Ron Swanson,Pass.
Ben Wyatt,"Ron, that document is nothing."
Ben Wyatt,It's not even notarized.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, if you die and you don't have a real will, most of what you own will go to the government."
Ron Swanson,Where is this lawyer you speak of?
Leslie Knope,"I'm pleased to formally submit Bill 68J, which funds a new bike path in Ramsett Park."
Jeremy Jamm,Motion to table this bill.
Councilman Dexhart,Second.
Leslie Knope,I also submit Bill 68R.
Jeremy Jamm,Motion to table.
Councilman Dexhart,Second.
Leslie Knope,You guys want to delay all my bills?
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna keep my head down and continue to get work done.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, well, uh, motion to end this session early so nothing can get done."
Councilman Dexhart,Second.
Leslie Knope,"Gahhh, you guys are the worst!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Sorry, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,We're just looking for any possible way to get you recalled because we don't like you.
Jeremy Jamm,It's nothing personal.
Leslie Knope,It absolutely is personal.
Leslie Knope,"That is the definition of ""personal."""
Jeremy Jamm,"""The definition of personal."""
Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, we have an issue."
Chris Traeger,"A tweet has been tweeted from the Parks and Rec Twitter, and I'm afraid it is quite sexually graphic."
Leslie Knope,It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.
Chris Traeger,"Whoever it is, it's quite serious."
Chris Traeger,Take a look at this.
Donna Meagle,"I don't want you to get recalled Knope, but damn, these people know how to pick a neck massager."
Donna Meagle,"And before you get on my case about those stickers, I already did 'em."
Chris Traeger,"Donna, there is trouble a-brewin'."
Leslie Knope,We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.
Donna Meagle,Uhoh.
Donna Meagle,What'd it say?
Leslie Knope,"""See you tonight."""
Leslie Knope,"""Hope you like tongue baths, you big, nasty fireman."""
Chris Traeger,Then there's a picture of a pair of lips and then a picture of an eggplant.
Chris Traeger,"I'm both confused, and if we're being totally honest, a little aroused."
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Donna Meagle,"Not to give you too much of a peek into my personal life, but this could have been way worse."
Leslie Knope,"What's important is, we deleted the tweet, and nobody is gonna know it's you, but Donna, you know, be more careful in the future."
Leslie Knope,This could've really blew up in my face.
Perd Hapley,"I'm here live, at a press conference, where Councilman Jeremy Jamm will discuss a government scandal we are calling ""Twitter Watergate"" until we can find a snappier name for it."
Jeremy Jamm,Tongue baths?
Jeremy Jamm,Eggplants?
Jeremy Jamm,Firemen?
Jeremy Jamm,Those men are heroes who deserve respect!
Jeremy Jamm,9/11!
Jeremy Jamm,This is how Leslie Knope runs her Parks Department?
Jeremy Jamm,"We are going to hold hearing after hearing, until we are satisfied."
Jeremy Jamm,This will be blown way out of proportion!
Jeremy Jamm,You have my word on it!
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Donna Meagle,"Ooh, this is bad."
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna get fired.
Leslie Knope,"No one is getting fired, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Jamm is trying to use this to hurt me in the recall.
Leslie Knope,"He's trying to take me down, and he's willing to attack my friends in the process?"
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,No way.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Chris Traeger,Not on her watch.
Leslie Knope,He is not gonna sully your name.
Chris Traeger,No sullying allowed!
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry about it, Donna."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna nip this in the bud.
Chris Traeger,"Guard your buds, 'cause they're about to get nipped!"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, why does Doctors Without Borders want to come to Pawnee?"
Nadia Stasky,Pawnee is like a petri dish of weird diseases.
Nadia Stasky,Did you know you have a higher rate of the West Nile virus than the actual Western Nile?
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, West Nile, looks like Pawnee wins again."
Nadia Stasky,What else have you beaten the Western Nile in?
Tom Haverford,Cricket.
Tom Haverford,"Uh just fill out these forms, and we will be all set like two biscuits inside a tin."
April Ludgate,"So, you've gone insane."
April Ludgate,That's fun.
Tom Haverford,I just panicked.
Tom Haverford,"She's so out of my league, my brain just made me talk that way so I'd seem cooler."
Tom Haverford,What should I do?
April Ludgate,Nothing!
April Ludgate,This is amazing.
Tom Haverford,April.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"If you want to have a chance with her, obviously, you have to stop."
April Ludgate,"It's either that, or you talk like that for the rest of your life."
Tom Haverford,You think she'd marry me?
Ben Wyatt,"All right, just let me do the talking here, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he's a lawyer, I'm an accountant."
Ben Wyatt,We speak the same language.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously, accountants are a little more bad boy, but, uh, there's a respect there."
Ron Swanson,When will this be over?
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Trevor."
Ben Wyatt,"I've been talking to Ron about estate planning, and he is here to do some ""Good Will Hunting."""
Ben Wyatt,"Because he has to draw up a new will, so"
Trevor Nelson,"Yes, I understood, Mr. Wyatt."
Trevor Nelson,Thank you.
Trevor Nelson,"As I've said before, I just don't like puns."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, my accountant friends seem to enjoy 'em."
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Swanson, let's begin by filling out this form, listing your assets and liabilities."
Ron Swanson,Nice try.
Ron Swanson,"I'm not telling you how much money I have, where it's hidden, or which precious metals and/or gemstones it may or may not take the form of."
Trevor Nelson,"If you don't give me the information I need, there's nothing I can do."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, come on, Trevor."
Ben Wyatt,"Where there's a ""Will,"" there's a way."
Trevor Nelson,"I'm gonna say this one last time, Wyatt."
Trevor Nelson,Check the accountant crap at the door.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, sir, I will."
Ben Wyatt,Unintentional.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, let's begin."
Jeremy Jamm,These hearings have two goals.
Jeremy Jamm,"One, to find out exactly how this offensive tweet came to be sent."
Jeremy Jamm,"And two, to turn this whole thing into a media circus."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Knope, do you have a statement?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's actually quite simple."
Leslie Knope,"Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again."
Jeremy Jamm,Stop stonewalling and tell us what happened here!
Leslie Knope,I just told you what happened.
Leslie Knope,It was an unfortunate mistake.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, sadly, due to your ""intracksidence"""
Leslie Knope,Not a word.
Jeremy Jamm,We may never find out what happened.
Jeremy Jamm,"When this sick, depraved tweet first came to light, you said, ""The account was probably hacked by some bored teenager."""
Jeremy Jamm,Now you're saying it's an unfortunate mistake.
Jeremy Jamm,Why do you keep flip-flopping?
Leslie Knope,"Well, because I learned new information."
Leslie Knope,"When I was four, I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flip-flopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup."
Jeremy Jamm,I don't think I'm out of line when I say that this scandal makes Benghazi look like whitewater!
Leslie Knope,It's utterly meaningless.
Jeremy Jamm,I think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet.
Jeremy Jamm,Perhaps he or she
Councilman Dexhart,Or them.
Councilman Dexhart,It could be a bunch of hot ladies.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, perhaps ""them"" can finally give us the answers we need."
Tom Haverford,"What, what, what?"
Tom Haverford,There she is.
Tom Haverford,"Nadia, I didn't know what you wanted, so I got you a cappuccino, a latte, four bags of coffee beans, and a mini espresso machine."
Nadia Stasky,What happened to your accent?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,It's gone.
Tom Haverford,Huh.
Tom Haverford,"You know, I had a cold recently."
Tom Haverford,"I think that may have affected my voice, like, in certain British ways."
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's all there is to that story, so no need for any more questions."
Nadia Stasky,You have a cold?
Nadia Stasky,Can I feel your glands?
Tom Haverford,Sure.
Nadia Stasky,"Wow, you are wearing a lot of moisturizer on your throat."
Tom Haverford,Best way to prevent crow's neck.
Nadia Stasky,Is this glitter?
Tom Haverford,"So, those are the forms."
Tom Haverford,You filled 'em out.
Tom Haverford,Great.
Tom Haverford,April's gonna file these.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, when is the thing you're doing in the park?"
Tom Haverford,I'd love to come by and maybe help administer vaccines?
Nadia Stasky,Oh.
Nadia Stasky,"Are you a doctor, somehow?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Nadia Stasky,No followup to that?
Nadia Stasky,"Okay, great."
Nadia Stasky,"Um, well, I'm not actually gonna be attending the event, so if you could just give me the permit, so that I can go home to Indianapolis and never come back here?"
Tom Haverford,"I am in love with Nadia Whatever her last name is, and I'm gonna keep her here, using the most powerful weapon I have-- bureaucratic incompetence."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Tom Haverford,You filled out Form 3208.
Tom Haverford,You were supposed to fill out Form 3248.
Nadia Stasky,"Oh, God."
Nadia Stasky,This is to lease a hangar at the airport.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,"It's so crazy, it almost sounds made up."
Tom Haverford,"Bureaucracy, right?"
Tom Haverford,What are you gonna do?
Tom Haverford,Huh.
Tom Haverford,Weird.
Tom Haverford,"Someone left out a blender, fresh fruits, and rum?"
Tom Haverford,"I guess we gotta, like, make Daiquiris now."
Tom Haverford,"I like to have music on while I work, you know?"
Nadia Stasky,What is this place?
Councilman Dexhart,"Ms. Meagle, let me first say that I am a big fan of your writing."
Donna Meagle,Thank you.
Councilman Dexhart,It's good stuff.
Councilman Dexhart,Really good stuff.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, does anyone else here see a double standard?"
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart is currently being sued by two different women for sexual harassment, one of whom was the judge in the first woman's trial."
Councilman Dexhart,She was talking dirty to me.
Leslie Knope,She was reading the emails that you sent to the first woman.
Donna Meagle,"Look, I obviously never meant to embarrass the parks department."
Donna Meagle,"My personal account is set to ""private."""
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I don't even know what she writes on there!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, you may not know what she's writing, but we do."
Jeremy Jamm,"In a shocking twist to an already juicy story, we have obtained access to Ms. Meagle's account, via a third party."
Jeremy Jamm,Same hairdresser.
Donna Meagle,"Damn it, Typhoon!"
Donna Meagle,Why'd you do this?
Typhoon,"Maybe if you had bothered to come to my Great Gatsby Brunch, you'd know."
Trevor Nelson,I don't even need an exact number.
Trevor Nelson,Just ballpark it.
Trevor Nelson,That's all I need to get started.
Ben Wyatt,"Or, I'm sure the state government would love to use your money to hire more bureaucrats, maybe build a library."
Ron Swanson,"Fine, a ballpark figure."
Trevor Nelson,Thank you.
Trevor Nelson,God.
Trevor Nelson,Holy [bleep].
Trevor Nelson,Is this a joke?
Ron Swanson,"Another word for ""jokes"" is ""lies."""
Ron Swanson,I do not lie.
Ron Swanson,"Therefore, I do not joke."
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Swanson, an estate of this size means that your children would never have to work a day in their lives."
Trevor Nelson,This is going to take some time.
Trevor Nelson,"Trusts need to be drawn, tax shelters."
Ron Swanson,That's enough.
Ron Swanson,I do not need some drawn-out legal expedition to tell me what I knew when I was eight.
Ron Swanson,Here's my original will.
Ron Swanson,"Do whatever lawyer nonsense you have to to make it official, and I will sign it."
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Trevor Nelson,Wait.
Trevor Nelson,What are all these symbols?
Ron Swanson,I was right not to be threatened by you.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, I would like to enter into the record a selection of Ms. Meagle's tweets."
Donna Meagle,Uhoh.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, can I request a brief recess?"
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, Donna."
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let them fire you.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's not me I'm worried about."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Beavers, if you please."
Ethel Beavers,"""Yesterday, 9:02 A.M. Annoying ass Leslie has given me another annoying ass task."""
Ethel Beavers,"""Number sign stickers, number sign bitch boss."""
Ethel Beavers,""" September 25th. Twitter poll: On a scale of 98 to 100, how annoying is Leslie Knope?"""
Ethel Beavers,"""Cuz u know it ain't less than 98."""
Ethel Beavers,"""All my number sign true blood fans know what's up."""
Jeremy Jamm,Page after page of personal attacks on Leslie Knope.
Jeremy Jamm,"Not only do you have no control over your department, you don't even have the respect of your employees."
Leslie Knope,That's what you really think of me?
Leslie Knope,You think I'm annoying?
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, sometimes you're kind of annoying."
Donna Meagle,"I mean, I thought that was your thing."
Leslie Knope,My thing?
Leslie Knope,My thing is not being annoying.
Leslie Knope,"My things are making friendship bracelets and dancing like nobody's watching, thinking up really cool nicknames for my friends."
Leslie Knope,"You of all people should know that, El Diablo!"
Donna Meagle,"Look, the only reason I'm even on Twitter is to blow off steam about work and tweet nasty stuff to dudes with washboard abs."
Donna Meagle,"You really think I hate you, after all we've been through the last ten years?"
Leslie Knope,I honestly don't know anymore.
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, I think we've done a lot of good here today."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I am sorry, but I could not postpone these pointless hearings that Jamm is having."
Chris Traeger,He is just determined.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you for trying."
Leslie Knope,I have a question for you.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm annoying?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Are you lying?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Are you trying to protect my feelings?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Do you think I'm being annoying right now?
Chris Traeger,Yes.
Leslie Knope,So you do think I'm annoying.
Chris Traeger,"I think that you ask a lot of the people that you work with, and I think that people do what you ask because they love you."
Chris Traeger,"But, I also think that driving people as hard as you do can ruffle some feathers."
Chris Traeger,I think a lot of things.
Chris Traeger,I like thinking.
Chris Traeger,And racquetball.
Leslie Knope,Now who's annoying?
Chris Traeger,"I spent the last hour reading some of Donna's old tweets, and it turns out there are some more things that she said about you."
Chris Traeger,"""Message to the recall haters: You can't keep Leslie Knope down."""
Chris Traeger,"""She's too real for this ish."""
Chris Traeger,"""hashtag boss bitch."""
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope is stepping up at these hearings and taking a bullet for me."""
Leslie Knope,"""hashtag sister from another mister, hashtag boss bitch."""
Chris Traeger,"It appears, whereas ""bitch boss"" is clearly an indication of her frustration, ""boss bitch"" is a term of endearment."
Chris Traeger,Isn't language fun?
Chris Traeger,It's like racquetball for your mouth!
April Ludgate,Did you change your outfit?
Tom Haverford,"I changed five times, and she hasn't noticed yet."
Tom Haverford,I can only stall for so long.
Tom Haverford,What should I do?
Nadia Stasky,"Um, I just finished filling this one out."
Nadia Stasky,"I didn't know what to put for ""Name of commercial airline,"" because I do not operate a commercial airline, so I just made one up."
Tom Haverford,What did you name your imaginary airline?
Nadia Stasky,"""Jet Blue Ivy."""
Nadia Stasky,I figure JayZ and Beyonce's kid will own her own airline eventually.
Tom Haverford,She's the one.
Nadia Stasky,"So, can I have my permit now?"
Nadia Stasky,Finally?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, no, there was a mistake, and we gave the park to someone else."
Nadia Stasky,What?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I can drive you around and we'll pick another one?
Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll bring a picnic lunch.
Tom Haverford,Do you like tamales?
Nadia Stasky,You said that that park was ours.
Nadia Stasky,"You said it a long time ago, in a British accent."
Nadia Stasky,"I probably shouldn't say this, as a doctor."
Nadia Stasky,It's probably not cool.
Nadia Stasky,But I really hope you all get West Nile virus.
Nadia Stasky,"Nice meeting you, April."
Nadia Stasky,Kind of.
Nadia Stasky,You're weird too.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,We need to talk.
Ron Swanson, That has never been true.
Ben Wyatt, I think I know what's happening.
Ben Wyatt," Thinking about how to divide up your possessions for when you die, it's tough, confronting your own mortality, and I think it's got you spinning a little bit."
Ben Wyatt, Am I right?
Ron Swanson,Wow.
Ron Swanson, I had not considered that.
Ron Swanson," Yes, I think that maybe you are on to something."
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Ben Wyatt," Just know that it's perfectly healthy to be thinking about-- Oh, you're joking."
Ron Swanson," Yes, son, I am."
Ron Swanson, First joke ever.
Ron Swanson, Don't care for it.
Ron Swanson, Death does not scare me.
Ron Swanson, What I am worried about is spoiling my children.
Ron Swanson," I don't want 'em to be the kind of people who never work, live off their trust funds, who buy their wooden furniture."
Ron Swanson," I will leave my children $50 apiece for the cab home from my funeral and a steak dinner, end of discussion."
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, look, it doesn't matter how much money you leave your kids."
Ben Wyatt, What matters is that you teach them the right values.
Ben Wyatt," But, if something horrible happens, and you want your kids to be left alone with no safety net, just so they can learn some kind of weird lesson, then, by all means, leave your fortune to the wild boar who gores you to death."
Ron Swanson, I'd never lose to a boar.
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry if I can be little annoying at times, but one person's annoying is another person's inspiring and heroic, so, you know, who are we to judge?"
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry for writing those things.
Donna Meagle, Some of those things.
Leslie Knope, I can't promise that I won't be inspiring and heroic in the future.
Donna Meagle, And I can't promise that I won't complain about it.
Leslie Knope, Deal.
Leslie Knope, I got you an apology present.
Donna Meagle, Oh!
Leslie Knope,"It is all of your favorite lipsticks and nail polishes, and I got the same ones too."
Leslie Knope," I printed out a schedule, so we can wear them at the same time."
Leslie Knope," Now, I would like you to open each one in front of me, and tell me how you feel about them individually."
Donna Meagle, Let me take a picture.
Leslie Knope, Are you tweeting this?
Donna Meagle,Mm-hmm.
Leslie Knope," What's the hashtag gonna be? ""Boss bitch"" or ""bitch boss""?"
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's ""psycho boss."""
Leslie Knope,"Eh, I don't hate that."
Ron Swanson," Benjamin, after thinking about what you said, I've decided to leave each of my children 5% of my fortune."
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, 5 whole percent."
Ben Wyatt," So, I guess you are gonna teach them a lesson."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, my God, that's 5%? That is a lot of money."
Ben Wyatt," Wait, is this a joke?"
Trevor Nelson,It is not a joke.
Trevor Nelson, Not that an accountant would know the difference.
Ron Swanson," Also, if something should happen to Diane and me, we decided that the kids should go to the most important people in our lives."
Ben Wyatt," Ron, I'm--I'm incredibly flattered."
Ron Swanson, Ralph Piatkowski and his wife Helen.
Ron Swanson," He's the Maitre D' at Mulligan's Steakhouse, and he knows me better than anyone."
Ron Swanson," However, if they are not able to do it, which seems likely, as they're in their 90s, you and Leslie are choice number two."
Ben Wyatt, I'm honored.
Jeremy Jamm," Everyone, take your seats, so this witch hunt may proceed as scheduled."
Jeremy Jamm," Speaking of, uh, where are the witches?"
Leslie Knope,"They're right here! Well, we're not witches."
Leslie Knope, That's sexist and offensive.
Leslie Knope," But we're right here, and we are not gonna sit in this room and let you drag our names through the mud just to score some cheap political points."
Jeremy Jamm, How dare you demean the value of the political points I'm scoring?
Leslie Knope,We have had enough.
Leslie Knope," I am going back to work so I can do some good for this town, and my friend Donna is coming with me."
Donna Meagle, Hmm.
Donna Meagle," I prefer ""El Diablo."""
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, this is not over, Ms. Knope."
Typhoon,"Donna, quit punishing me! I miss you."
Donna Meagle," - Uh-uh! Bridge burned, Typhoon."
Donna Meagle," Or should I say, ""Norman""? Uh-huh."
Tom Haverford," Okay, I'm just gonna man up, tell her how I feel, and hope she feels the same way about me, and that's that."
Tom Haverford," If she doesn't, no big deal."
Tom Haverford, It's done.
Tom Haverford, I'm an adult.
Tom Haverford, Let's do it.
April Ludgate, Great.
Tom Haverford," Nope, I can't do it."
Tom Haverford, New plan.
Tom Haverford, Tell her all the screw-ups were your fault.
Tom Haverford," I'll tell her I had to cover for you, because you are so dumb."
Tom Haverford, Nadia! We're very sorry for everything you went through today.
Tom Haverford, I have reserved the park for your event.
Tom Haverford," Now, April has something she'd like to admit."
April Ludgate," Tom wants me to tell you that all the screw-ups were my fault, but really, he kept messing up so that you would stay in Pawnee as long as possible because he is super into you."
Nadia Stasky, Okay.
Nadia Stasky, Several questions.
Nadia Stasky,Is any part of him British?
April Ludgate,No.
Nadia Stasky," So, that was just weird, panicky dude behavior?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Nadia Stasky,Okay.
Nadia Stasky," I'm just trying to figure out if acting that insane is, like, romantic, or totally scary."
Nadia Stasky, I'll go with romantic.
Nadia Stasky, He is kind of cute.
Nadia Stasky, What's his deal?
April Ludgate,"He's sweet, he's cool, and you're, like, way out of his league, so there's literally no risk for you at all here."
Nadia Stasky, Okay.
Nadia Stasky," Well, I am going to Rwanda in, like, two weeks for my job, so, what the hell?"
April Ludgate,Cool.
Nadia Stasky," So, you want to go out with me?"
Tom Haverford,"Yes, please."
Nadia Stasky, Okay.
Nadia Stasky, Bye.
April Ludgate," Okay, you owe me, like, 1,000 favors."
April Ludgate, See ya.

Jerry Gergich,Are you getting ready with Andy in London?
Jerry Gergich,You look lovely.
April Ludgate,I'm going to murder you a thousand times.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
April Ludgate,What the hell?
Andy Dwyer,"Someone's back from London, no, it's not the queen   someone's back from London, it's not Mr. Bean."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,"It's not the royal baby, I think his name is Jeff"
April Ludgate,Stop singing!
April Ludgate,Kiss me!
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,What are you doing here?
Andy Dwyer,"Just missed you so bad, honey, I bought myself a ticket home."
Andy Dwyer,"You're never gonna need that computer again 'cause I'm home for, like, 19 hours."
Jerry Gergich,This is so sweet.
Jerry Gergich,Just like the old days.
Andy Dwyer,"Take a hike, Jerry."
Jerry Gergich,It's Larry now.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, take a hike, Larry."
Councilman Howser,"Next order of business, Councilman Jamm proposes Bill 949c."
Jeremy Jamm,"That's right, stretch, and looking mighty fly in that suit, brother."
Jeremy Jamm,"Okay, this excellent bill only allows someone to vote in a Pawnee election, for example, the upcoming recall election, if their I.D. lists an official Pawnee address."
Leslie Knope,"Really, councilman?"
Leslie Knope,Again?
Leslie Knope,"The recall election is coming up, and Jamm keeps trying to figure out ways to screw me over."
Leslie Knope,"Last week, he tried to have me listed on the ballot as ""Leslie Buttface Hitler the Fourth."""
Leslie Knope,"All you're trying to do is disenfranchise the people from former Eagleton, people who will most likely vote for me because I saved a lot of their jobs."
Leslie Knope,I move that we table the discussion until after the election.
Councilman Howser,Second.
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Councilman Howser,Ah!
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Leslie Knope,I just get excited when you like me.
Leslie Knope,"I put my career on the line by saving Eagleton, and he's trying to rob me of their votes?"
Leslie Knope,Those are my votes.
Leslie Knope,I've earned them!
Leslie Knope,I want them!
Leslie Knope,Give me those votes!
Ben Wyatt,I don't have them on me.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe Jamm tried to pull that crap.
Ben Wyatt,I can.
Ben Wyatt,He's a horrible monster.
Ben Wyatt,But let's focus on the more important issue.
Ben Wyatt,You want to squeeze in one more practice session?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, do I?"
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, I am throwing Ben his dream birthday party, a roller skating bash with an early '90s theme."
Leslie Knope,Ben lives for the early '90s.
Leslie Knope,"The music, the fashion."
Leslie Knope,It's his favorite era.
Leslie Knope,As for the roller skating
Ben Wyatt,I have a thing for women in skates.
Ben Wyatt,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,"Everyone has a thing, and that's mine."
Ben Wyatt,"As far as things go, it's pretty innocuous."
Ben Wyatt,"Could be one of those dudes that kisses mannequins or whatever, but I like a woman in skates."
Ben Wyatt,A lot.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Ann, Ann called."
April Ludgate,She wants her ugly outfit back.
Ann Perkins,Why are you dressed as a pilgrim?
April Ludgate,"Leslie said it was a ""Come As You Were in the '90s"" party."
April Ludgate,I assumed it was the 1690s.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, if it was the 1690s, we'd all be mummies."
Ann Perkins,What do you think mummies are?
Andy Dwyer,Skeletons?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, boy."
Nadia Stasky,Hey.
Nadia Stasky,"I just came straight from work, so I couldn't dress up."
Tom Haverford,No problem.
Tom Haverford,You look wiggidy wiggidy wiggidy wiggidy wonderful.
Nadia Stasky,Wait a minute.
Nadia Stasky,Pants on backwards.
Nadia Stasky,"Kris Kross, right?"
Nadia Stasky,Nice!
Nadia Stasky,What happens when you have to pee?
Tom Haverford,I actually just went.
Tom Haverford,I had to pull my pants all the way to the ground like a toddler.
Tom Haverford,"Nadia, the super hot doctor, has been hanging out with me for the last week."
Tom Haverford,She's definitely out of my league.
Tom Haverford,"Actually, we're not even playing the same sport."
Tom Haverford,It's kind of like she's in NBA and I work at a muffler store next to the stadium.
Tom Haverford,I can't believe we met just before you have to go on your stupid vacation.
Nadia Stasky,"I'm doing doctors without borders, man."
Nadia Stasky,I'm going to Rwanda.
Tom Haverford,Exactly.
Tom Haverford,That's a stupid vacation.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, why don't you win me that huge-ass bear as a going-away present?"
Tom Haverford,No problem.
Tom Haverford,I'm a skee ball master.
Nadia Stasky,No way!
Nadia Stasky,Why don't you go pro?
Tom Haverford,I don't know.
Tom Haverford,I didn't want to be a cliche.
Tom Haverford,Yet another professional Indian skee ball player?
Nadia Stasky,Right.
Extra,Now that's what I call shooting.
Ron Swanson,Is this a hunting game?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's fun."
Donna Meagle,You want to play?
Ron Swanson,"Indeed, I do."
Ron Swanson,"If you'd like, I could offer you some pointers."
Ron Swanson,"Hunting, Donna, is about silence, balance, and patience."
Extra,Get ready.
Donna Meagle,"You know you're supposed to hit the deer, right?"
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Donna Meagle,"Get it together, Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"Well, the game is absurd."
Ron Swanson,"This gun is lightweight, there's no sight, and we are far too close to these deer."
Ron Swanson,Would they not smell us?
Ron Swanson,I want my money back.
Ron Swanson,How do I get my quarters?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God!"
Donna Meagle,You are such a sore loser.
Ron Swanson,I am not a sore loser.
Ron Swanson,"It's just that I prefer to win, and when I don't, I get furious."
Ron Swanson,Employee!
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,Watch this.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that was brilliant."
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer,You probably don't know what that means.
Andy Dwyer,"You know how you Americans say ""cool"" when something's cool?"
Andy Dwyer,"Over in London, we say, ""That's brilliant."""
April Ludgate,"Speaking of London, you haven't told me anything about work."
April Ludgate,You still love it?
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's awesome."
Andy Dwyer,I'm kicking ass.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm like Chuck Norris, only instead of crushing bad guys' skulls, I'm crushing documents."
April Ludgate,That's great.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Now be the Chuck Norris of making out with me.
Andy Dwyer,I'll karate punch your face with my tongue.
April Ludgate,Prove it.
Andy Dwyer,Hiyah.
Ben Wyatt,Get this.
Ben Wyatt,I just asked the DJ what REM albums he has.
Ben Wyatt,"He's got Monster, but not Automatic For the People."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,"It's like, what is this?"
Ben Wyatt,A mid-'90s party?
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,It's an early '90s party.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Larry."
Leslie Knope,Tell us how this looks.
Leslie Knope,Ben wants to do a synchronized couple skate to Losing My Religion.
Leslie Knope,Hit it!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,Leslie!
Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but we have a problem."
Chris Traeger,His name is Jeremy Jamm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, as noted in Article nine, Paragraph two"
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I thought this bill was tabled?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, and I called a special session and untabled it."
Jeremy Jamm,What's up with the roller skates?
Leslie Knope,"I was about to attend a roller skating birthday party for my husband, but this is more important."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, I don't care."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm a blades guy.
Leslie Knope,Point of order!
Leslie Knope,The councilwoman wishes to speak on this issue.
Jeremy Jamm,Will the councilwoman yield her time so we can vote on this sucker?
Leslie Knope,"No, I will not yield."
Leslie Knope,Nor will I yield for the rest of the evening.
Jeremy Jamm,A filibuster?
Jeremy Jamm,Are you dookin' on my chest right now?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Gross!
Leslie Knope,"And yes, it's a filibuster."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,I am not willing to let you deprive me
Chris Traeger,She's filibustering on roller skates?
Chris Traeger,She's gonna be strapped into those things for hours.
Ben Wyatt,"I know this is a dire situation, but I swear to God, this is like a crazy sex fantasy for me."
Nadia Stasky,How goes it?
Tom Haverford,"Pretty good, except I suck at skee ball."
Nadia Stasky,"Well, that's too bad, 'cause if you don't win me that bear, you're dead to me."
Tom Haverford,Understood.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, how many tickets for that bear, again?"
Morris,"40,000.00"
Tom Haverford,"40,000?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, brother."
Tom Haverford,"All right, you're gonna be my lookout for a second."
Nadia Stasky,"Hey, is he allowed to do that?"
Morris,No!
Morris,"Get off the ramp, dude!"
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,You're supposed to be my lookout.
Nadia Stasky,I thought it'd be funnier to watch you get busted.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're a doctor."
Tom Haverford,You know snitches get stitches.
Leslie Knope,I remember the first time I voted.
Leslie Knope,"I was in my bedroom, and I was five."
Leslie Knope,"I voted for Mildred, my stuffed pig, but my cat, pancakes, won."
Leslie Knope,She had more funding.
Leslie Knope,"Politics, right?"
Leslie Knope,What are you gonna do?
Leslie Knope,How long have I been talking?
Leslie Knope,Three hours?
Leslie Knope,"No, eight minutes."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe you should yield the floor.
Jeremy Jamm,Milton doesn't have a lot of time left on earth.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, just kidding, bud."
Councilman Milton,Will someone open my crackers?
Ben Wyatt,The session ends at 11:00 P.M.
Ben Wyatt,She has to talk the whole time.
Ben Wyatt,"She can't lean on anything for support, and no one else can help her."
Ben Wyatt,Three strikes and she is done.
Chris Traeger,This is literally the most exciting thing that I've ever seen.
Chris Traeger,"I mean, think about it."
Chris Traeger,Where else on earth would you rather spend your birthday with Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, maybe the birthday party she's throwing for me right now."
Leslie Knope,Everyone in Pawnee should have the right to vote.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"As I dissect this important and profound statement, I'm just gonna take these off for a second."
Jeremy Jamm,"Bam, strike one."
Jeremy Jamm,No sitting.
Leslie Knope,Is the gong really necessary?
Jeremy Jamm,"Yes, it is."
Jeremy Jamm,I love Chinese crap.
Jeremy Jamm,"Lucy Liu, Nintendo, Gangnam Style, sushi, et cetera, et cetera."
Jeremy Jamm,"Also, more importantly, it's in the rules."
Jeremy Jamm,No sitting.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the strike is worth it if I can take these off."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man!"
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God!"
Ann Perkins,I had this exact bear when I was a kid!
Ann Perkins,Excuse me.
Morris,Uh-huh.
Ann Perkins,How much does this bear cost?
Morris,40000 tickets.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, let's just assume that I'm an adult who doesn't have two weeks to play arcade games."
Ann Perkins,What about 50 bucks?
Morris,Yeah.
Morris,Just don't tell my boss.
Extra,"What are you doing, Morris?"
Morris,"Nothing, Mr. Bonderman."
Extra,Tuck in your shirt.
Extra,God!
Morris,Sorry.
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,You feeling it?
Donna Meagle,Wow.
Donna Meagle,You suck at this.
Ron Swanson,"Donna, please back up two paces so I can physically destroy this machine."
Donna Meagle,"Can you chill a little, man?"
Donna Meagle,It's not real hunting.
Donna Meagle,It's just a game.
Donna Meagle,That you happen to suck at.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,That's a good point.
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,That you suck at this?
Ron Swanson,That it's not real hunting.
Ron Swanson,Come with me.
April Ludgate,I don't want you to go back to London.
Andy Dwyer,"Just remember, every time you look up at the moon, I, too, will be looking at a moon."
Andy Dwyer,"Not the same moon, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,That's impossible.
April Ludgate,See you on stupid Skype.
April Ludgate,I'm proud of Andy.
April Ludgate,This is the first time he's really gone out on a limb.
April Ludgate,"I knew if he found something that he actually liked doing, he'd be happy, so I'm…"
April Ludgate,What the hell?
April Ludgate,Wha--
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,Perkins!
Tom Haverford,What are you doing with my bear?
Tom Haverford,"I've been playing skee ball for, like, two hours trying to win that for Nadia."
Ann Perkins,I just bought it for 50 bucks.
Ann Perkins,"When I was a kid, I taught myself how to make out on this bear, pretended it was Cockroach from The Cosby Show."
Nadia Stasky,"Hey, what's going on here?"
Nadia Stasky,Why does blossom have my bear?
Ann Perkins,"I bought it for myself, but apparently, he was trying to win it for you, so I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford,"I still got some tickets, though."
Tom Haverford,"I could get you, uh, a ninja turtle balloon or Cliffhanger on VHS."
Nadia Stasky,"Oh, that's so sweet, but you're basically offering me garbage."
Nadia Stasky,Let's just skate.
Tom Haverford,That bear was the only thing she was gonna have to remember me by in Rwanda.
Tom Haverford,"And if I know anything about Rwanda, and I don't, I bet it's full of rich guys who'll buy her whatever she wants."
Ron Swanson,Hunting.
Ron Swanson,No quarters required.
Donna Meagle,Hang on.
Donna Meagle,Do you have a license to hunt at night?
Donna Meagle,'Cause you need a license.
Ron Swanson,I thought you were serious.
Donna Meagle,Come on now.
Donna Meagle,You know I don't give a [bleep].
Leslie Knope,"As Ronald Reagan would say, ""Well, mommy, I believe voting rights are important."""
Leslie Knope,Does anyone else think it's hot in here?
Leslie Knope,These overalls are really starchy.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, maybe that's 'cause I turned up the heat to 90, and, uh, oh, the knob broke off in my hand."
Jeremy Jamm,Oops.
Leslie Knope,"Well, speaking of heat, we should discuss America's whitehot passion for voting rights and the men and women who help protect them, like the local city councilwoman who is starving and thinking about her husband's Reservoir Dog themed birthday cake and wanting to eat it really badly."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, this is not a good sign."
Ben Wyatt,"Once she starts thinking about birthday cake, she's basically useless until she eats birthday cake."
Leslie Knope,Democracy is not unlike a cake.
Leslie Knope,"It's layered, delicious, chocolate, and I want some."
Chris Traeger,"Okay, she's fading."
Chris Traeger,"Ben, we need to find a way to smuggle some mineral oil drops onto her tongue."
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,Excuse me.
Extra,What the hell are you people doing here?
Extra,We represent the citizens of former Eagleton.
Extra,We're here to support Leslie Knope for preserving our voting rights.
Leslie Knope,Thank you!
Leslie Knope,You are all warriors of democracy.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it was the first mayor of Pawnee, in 1817, who said, ""All we have is the right to vote and the right to kill Indians without consequence."""
Leslie Knope,And I believe that half of that statement is still true today.
Leslie Knope,All right!
Leslie Knope,Second wind!
April Ludgate,"Andy, I know you're in there."
April Ludgate,"Andy, come on."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey."
Andy Dwyer,I was just... just here in this dumpster 'cause I jumped in.
April Ludgate,Get out!
April Ludgate,We need to talk.
Andy Dwyer,About what?
Ron Swanson,"Fresh air, real weapons, an honest kill."
Ron Swanson,There is no substitute for the real thing.
Donna Meagle,"You want to go back and play that video game, don't you?"
Ron Swanson,Yes!
Ron Swanson,Damn it!
Chris Traeger,It is so inspiring to see Eagletonians putting aside their prejudices.
Chris Traeger,"With support like this, Leslie Knope may stand a fighting chance on recall day."
Chris Traeger,Permission to hug you.
Extra,Granted.
Extra,"I should mention, though, that we're not voting to keep Leslie."
Chris Traeger,What?
Extra,We want someone from Eagleton to represent our interests on the new city council.
Chris Traeger,"Sir, I formally revoke our hug."
Extra,"Well, you can't."
Extra,It happened.
Leslie Knope,"We stand on the side of Rosa Parks, and Gandhi, and Team Aniston."
Leslie Knope,One small vote for Pawnee is one giant leap of voting for mankind.
Jeremy Jamm,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, you're not allowed to receive help from the crowd."
Jeremy Jamm,That's strike two.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, man, leave my gong alone."
Jeremy Jamm,The reverb is the best part.
Leslie Knope,"If I save your right to vote, you're gonna vote for someone from Eagleton?"
Extra,Eagleton!
Extra,Eagleton!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Knope!"
Jeremy Jamm,Wrap it up!
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna yield.
Leslie Knope,I just… I need some time to think.
Leslie Knope,"And because I must keep talking, I'm gonna think out loud."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, if Eagletonians vote for someone else, then it would be in my best interest to stop, right?"
Leslie Knope,So they can't vote.
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, dadoy."
Jeremy Jamm,Yield.
Leslie Knope,"Or I keep going, because the right to vote is fundamental in any democracy, and this is bigger than me or anyone."
Leslie Knope,I don't care if I lose.
Leslie Knope,No one prevents people in my town from voting.
Leslie Knope,Not on my watch.
Leslie Knope,The filibuster is on!
Extra,Yeah!
Extra,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,I can't go back to London.
Andy Dwyer,I'm totally in over my head on this project.
Andy Dwyer,"Every day, someone comes up to me and says, ""I need your approval on this, Mr. Dywer."""
Andy Dwyer,"""I need your signature, Mr. Dwyer."""
Andy Dwyer,"""That's not a toilet, Mr. Dwyer."""
April Ludgate,But you said everything was going awesome.
April Ludgate, You said you were like Chuck Norris.
Andy Dwyer," I am, but I'm like Chuck Norris now-- some old guy with a beard who used to be good at karate but became a dumb has-been and is scared and confused about his big London job."
April Ludgate, Okay.
Andy Dwyer, The parallels between he and I are very eerie.
April Ludgate, I'm gonna tell you a secret about everyone else's job.
Andy Dwyer, Okay.
April Ludgate, No one knows what they're doing.
April Ludgate, I don't know how to run an animal control department.
April Ludgate, Half the documents I get I put right into the shredder because they're so boring.
Andy Dwyer, But you seem like you do know what you're doing.
April Ludgate," Yeah, I seem like it."
April Ludgate," Deep down, everyone is just faking it until they figure it out."
April Ludgate," And you will too, because you are awesome and everyone else sucks."
Ben Wyatt, 30 minutes to go.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, it's so hot."
Leslie Knope, Almost as hot as the flames that Eagleton would have gone down in if I had not saved them.
Jeremy Jamm," Mm, mm, mm."
Leslie Knope,That's-- 
Jeremy Jamm,How I know you would love an ice-cold frozen marg.
Leslie Knope, All I want is the promise of democracy.
Jeremy Jamm, Sure about that?
Leslie Knope,I want that marg.
Jeremy Jamm,I know you do.
Leslie Knope, I want that Margarita.
Jeremy Jamm," Oh, it's gonna be so good."
Jeremy Jamm, So cold.
Jeremy Jamm, It's so cold.
Leslie Knope, I want to drink it.
Jeremy Jamm, Make that heat go away!
Jeremy Jamm,"Come on, get! Come on, girl."
Jeremy Jamm, Get!
Leslie Knope,Give me that Margarita!
Leslie Knope,No! I want votes.
Ron Swanson," Excuse me, worker, bring me a bucket of beers and four hot dogs."
Ron Swanson," Please, and thank you."
Morris, Why are you covered in blood?
Donna Meagle,Don't worry.
Donna Meagle, It's not human.
Ron Swanson," I hope you've made peace with your God, small electronic deer."
Donna Meagle, Kill it.
Tom Haverford," Ann, I need that bear."
Tom Haverford, I got to give Nadia something awesome so she'll remember me when she's in Africa.
Ann Perkins," Tom, bear or no bear, she clearly likes you."
Ann Perkins," Actually, how do you even get girls like her-- or me-- to go out with you?"
Tom Haverford,Scientists say the emotions of love and hate are very close to each other.
Tom Haverford, That's what I tell women.
Ann Perkins," The point is, she's leaving in two days."
Ann Perkins," You want her to remember you? Go spend time with her and do something memorable, dummy!"
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ann."
Tom Haverford," I know conversations like this are hard for you 'cause you still have feelings for me, but you'll land on your feet, kid."
Ann Perkins,Run or I punch you.
Tom Haverford,No punchies!
Andy Dwyer," Okay, bye for real this time."
April Ludgate," Wait, wait, wait."
April Ludgate, I made you five bologna sandwiches in case you get hungry on the way to the airport.
Andy Dwyer, Did you--
April Ludgate,"Yes, I used cookies instead of bread."
Andy Dwyer, You think of everything.
Andy Dwyer, I love you.
April Ludgate, Love you too.
April Ludgate, Are you kidding me?
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,"Ha! Ha! Found it! I got-- I left my wallet in here earlier, I guess."
Andy Dwyer, Whoo! All good now.
Andy Dwyer," Ooh, look! Noodles!"
April Ludgate,"No, no, no, babe."
April Ludgate," Babe, don't touch those."
Ben Wyatt, I've read the entire charter.
Ben Wyatt, There's no other way to get her a bathroom break unless we bring the bathroom to her-- that's nothing.
Chris Traeger," I mean, she's not gonna make it."
Chris Traeger," Look at her, she's dancing around like she's a character in one of those Peanuts cartoons."
Leslie Knope," Okay, in these last few minutes, I would like to talk about the voting rights act of 1968 while clenching every muscle in my body."
Leslie Knope, Sound good?
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, Knope, how you feeling over there? You go pee-pee? Pee-pee times? Make wee-wee?"
Ben Wyatt,Five more seconds.
Extra," Four, three, two, one!"
Councilman Howser,This session is adjourned.
Councilman Howser, All pending matters are tabled.
Extra, Yes!
Ben Wyatt,You were amazing.
Leslie Knope,"I love you, but move! I have to go to the whiz palace."
Leslie Knope," Oh, wait!"
Extra,Eagleton! Eagleton!
Jeremy Jamm,Oh! My beautiful curls!
Ben Wyatt,"She didn't have time to hug me, but she could do that?"
Nadia Stasky,"Hey, Ann, can I talk to you for a second?"
Nadia Stasky,About Tom?
Ann Perkins,Sure.
Ann Perkins, You guys look like you're having fun.
Nadia Stasky," Yeah, no, I really like him."
Nadia Stasky," I just wanted to say that I think you're really cool, and the fact that Tom dated you makes me think he's a really good guy."
Ann Perkins, That's so sweet.
Ann Perkins," Oh, okay."
Ann Perkins, Wha--what are you-- - What the hell?
Nadia Stasky,Now!
Tom Haverford,"Sorry, Ann, this is on you."
Tom Haverford, You told us to make a memory.
Tom Haverford,There's your money back.
Ann Perkins,Let go!
Nadia Stasky,Suck it!
Ann Perkins,This is $8!
Tom Haverford,"Man, that was so much fun."
Nadia Stasky, - Yeah.
Nadia Stasky," Together, we truly did steal a toy from your pregnant friend."
Tom Haverford," - Hey, can I ask you something?"
Nadia Stasky,Mm-hmm.
Tom Haverford," I know we just met, like, two weeks ago and whatever, but is there any chance maybe, when you get back, we can maybe--"
Nadia Stasky,Ugh.
Nadia Stasky, Clingy.
Tom Haverford," Oh, no."
Tom Haverford, Sorry.
Tom Haverford," No, no, no, no."
Nadia Stasky, I'm kidding.
Nadia Stasky, Of course I'll call you when I come back.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Nadia Stasky,Yeah.
Ann Perkins," So long, suckers!"
Nadia Stasky,Hey! Quick!
Ron Swanson,"Ooh! Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
Extra,Now that's what I call shooting.
Ron Swanson,Come on!
Extra,That's a new record!
Donna Meagle,Hey! Look at that! You finally made it in the top 10.
Donna Meagle, Now you can enter your initials.
Ron Swanson, My initials are private.
Donna Meagle, Then just put in any three letters.
Ron Swanson, Ass.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God! That was epic! I was peeing so freakin' hard, it was like a jacuzzi jet or--"
Ingrid de Forest,"Hi, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey! Ingrid! I wasn't talking about the velocity of my pee because you are a very smart and classy lady.
Leslie Knope," Ben, you remember Ingrid de Forest from the former Eagleton."
Ben Wyatt," Yes, she was just telling me she's been nominated to run against you in the recall."
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, Buzz kill.
Ingrid de Forest," I know you must hate me right now, Leslie, and that's justified, but I need to thank you for what you just did in there."
Ingrid de Forest, Not the forceful urination.
Ingrid de Forest, The filibuster.
Leslie Knope," Right, yeah."
Ingrid de Forest," It was incredibly courageous, and it was selfless."
Ingrid de Forest," And if I do win, I'm gonna have very big roller skates to fill."
Ingrid de Forest, Could I take you out for a celebratory plate of-- I think you call them waffles?
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that is the best offer you could ever make, but I had to miss my husband's birthday party for this, so I think I'll be spending the evening with him."
Leslie Knope,"A rain check, maybe."
Ingrid de Forest,Please.
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry your birthday party got all screwed up.
Leslie Knope, Maybe I should put those roller skates back on.
Ben Wyatt," Well, you must be exhausted."
Ben Wyatt, We don't have to go to the party.
Leslie Knope," Oh, we're not going to the party."
Leslie Knope, We're going home.
Ben Wyatt," Then why would you need to put on rollerskates? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! We're just-- we're just-- skates.   "

Tom Haverford,Business at RentaSwag could not be better.
Tom Haverford,"Yesterday Jaden Smith came in, and he was like, ""Look, I want to quit the music/acting business and work here with you."""
Tom Haverford,"And I was like, ""Jaden, be serious."""
Tom Haverford,The world needs you.
Tom Haverford,You have a gift.
Trevor Nelson,"Ever since my client opened his store across the street, your sales have plummeted."
Trevor Nelson,It's only a matter of time before you're out of business.
Trevor Nelson,"But my client has had a moment of weakness, something he referred to as ""sympathy""?"
Trevor Nelson,"He's made you a final offer 40,000 dollars for RentaSwag and all of its contents."
Trevor Nelson,I suggest you take it.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I've heard all the facts, and it's pretty obvious what I have to do-- Get a big old mug of hot chocolate, put on my thinking PJs, and get back to you."
Trevor Nelson,The offer is valid for 48 hours.
Trevor Nelson,We would also be interested in acquiring your thinking PJs.
Tom Haverford,Listen to me very carefully.
Tom Haverford,"No matter what happens, you will never acquire my thinking PJs or my YouTube blazer... Nonnegotiable."
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, everyone else was able to make it to the committee meeting on time."
Leslie Knope,What's your excuse?
Jerry Gergich,I was voting for you in the recall election.
Jerry Gergich,Lots of people wearing Leslie Knope buttons.
Leslie Knope,No discussion about the recall election until the polls close at 8:00.
Leslie Knope,Let's focus on what we can control.
Leslie Knope,"In 24 hours, we are going to transform City Hall into the best haunted house Pawnee has ever seen."
April Ludgate,There's been a mistake.
April Ludgate,"This says that I'm in charge of the silly skeleton room, when really it should say ""the undead serial killer room."""
April Ludgate,Who do I talk to about changing this?
Leslie Knope,It's recall day.
Leslie Knope,"I've made my case, and the latest polls have it as a dead heat, so there's nothing left to do but wait."
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I got stuff to do."
Leslie Knope,I'm planning a haunted house.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, um... It's Kevin Pollack's birthday."
Leslie Knope,That's something to focus on today.
Leslie Knope,Who cares about the recall?
Leslie Knope,It's Kevin's day.
Tom Haverford,"I don't know what to do I could take the offer and break even, but I've come so far."
Tom Haverford,"Ron, can you put some more tiny marshmallow in my hot chocky?"
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,"If there was something I could do for you, I would."
Ron Swanson,Maybe you should try taking a walk... Out of my office.
Donna Meagle,Ron!
Donna Meagle,You're in Bloosh!
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh?
Donna Meagle,Ron is in Bloosh!
Ron Swanson,What is Bloosh?
Tom Haverford,Bloosh is a weekly lifestyle email written by Annabel Porter.
Tom Haverford,She used to be the face of the Eagleton phone book.
Tom Haverford,Then she moved to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming friends with a bunch of celebrities.
Tom Haverford,Then she moved back to become a lifestyle guru.
Tom Haverford,She's legit.
Tom Haverford,She spent four months living in Kate Bosworth's pool house.
Tom Haverford,"""A Ron Swanson designed chair is the musthave item of the season, along with red quinoa, wind therapy, and buying an island."""
Donna Meagle,Annabel says that buying an island is the only real way to know that your goji-berry farm is pesticide-free.
Tom Haverford,I've been trying to get RentaSwag in Bloosh for months.
Tom Haverford,"And now that you got in, I can get in too."
Tom Haverford,"Congratulations, Ron!"
Tom Haverford,We did it!
Donna Meagle,Someone's getting a new leather jacket.
Ron Swanson,I don't want a leather jacket.
Donna Meagle,It's for me.
Donna Meagle,This is a great day!
Donna Meagle,Ron's in Bloosh!
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Ron's in Bloosh!
Donna Meagle,Do it.
Tom Haverford,Ron's in Bloosh!
Chris Traeger,"April, you seem depressed, and I would know."
Chris Traeger,I spent most of last year being treated by Dr. Richard Nygard for my own emotional problems.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I just miss Andy."
April Ludgate,"Halloween was, like, kind of our thing."
April Ludgate,"Every year, we would dress up like demons and egg Larry's house."
Jerry Gergich,That was you?
Chris Traeger,"Larry, please."
Chris Traeger,We're having a private conversation.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I'd like to make Halloween fun for you, like Andy would have, starting right now... With scary, scary monster claws!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, people, the grand opening is in 20 hours."
Leslie Knope,"Larry, you had the easiest job, Two triangles and a tooth."
Leslie Knope,Nobody wants Gengurch family themed Jackolanterns.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle likes them.
Leslie Knope,Is any of this even good?
Leslie Knope,"Why didn't we call it ""City Halloween""?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need to change every single banner."
Ann Perkins,"Leslie's been holding it together pretty well, but today is when she needs us the most."
Ann Perkins,That's why we formed the Leslie Knope emotional support task force.
Ben Wyatt,"Anything she could possibly need to get her through these final hours, we got it covered"
Ben Wyatt,"Back rubs, YouTube videos of turtles and birds becoming friends"
Ann Perkins,A poster announcing the new Lilith Fair concert.
Ann Perkins,"It's fake, but it'll buy us an hour."
Ben Wyatt,We even have a secret hand signal in case we think she needs help.
Ben Wyatt,It's loosely based on the Klingon greeting salute.
Ann Perkins,I just learned that.
Ann Perkins,"And if I had known, I would not have agreed to it."
Ann Perkins,"Uh, hey, Leslie, how about instead of slightly changing a lot of banners, we paint our toenails to look like pumpkins?"
Leslie Knope,Fun!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're a genius!"
Leslie Knope,Your brain is almost as perfect as your face.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, Ron, baby, what are the hot deets on Bloosh?"
Ron Swanson,Start over and speak differently.
Tom Haverford,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,Did you call that P.R. guy?
Tom Haverford,What's the latest news?
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Joan Callamezzo wants me to go on Pawnee Today to discuss my chairs with this Porter woman."
Ron Swanson,I said no.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, you said if there was something you could do to help me, you would."
Tom Haverford,Getting in Bloosh is my last chance to save my store.
Tom Haverford,You have to go and take me so I can meet her.
Tom Haverford,Please?
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"If it's that important to your company, I'll do it."
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Tom Haverford,"Now, I know highend, Internet only lifestyle magazine really isn't your scene, so Donna and I wrote up some cocktail banter and some conversation snippets for you to practice so you can fit in."
Ron Swanson,"""Annabel, could I be more jels of your lowlights right now?"""
Ron Swanson,"""I mean, O.M.Squee, talk about bangs envy."""
Donna Meagle,"Oof, you got a long way to go, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,"Let's go again, from the top."
Ron Swanson,I regret everything.
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, you made it."
Ben Wyatt,It's 8:00.
Leslie Knope,Thank God.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, great work, as always."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna stay here and just kind of wait for the results to pour in.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'll see you all tomorrow.
Ann Perkins,We're not going anywhere.
Ann Perkins,We're staying with you.
Leslie Knope,"No, really, it's gonna be hours before they call it."
Ron Swanson,"We're not leaving, woman."
Ron Swanson,Stop trying to get rid of us.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I made frappuccinos for a little caffeine boost, and Larry went to get pizzas for everyone."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, that's very sweet, you guys."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"All right, let's hunker down."
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a long night.
Perd Hapley,"Too close to call, a real nailbiter, anybody's game"
Perd Hapley,"These are three phrases you won't hear tonight, as Leslie Knope has been voted out of office."
Perd Hapley,What was expected to be a close race
Leslie Knope,What did he say?
Perd Hapley,Has actually been a not close race.
Perd Hapley,Pawnee voters have decisively removed Leslie Knope
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, I'm so sorry."
Perd Hapley,From the City Council.
Jerry Gergich,"I gota the pizza pizza time, it'sa pizza time!"
Chris Traeger,"Larry, everyone is miserable, and you are only making it worse."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie's on her way in."
Ann Perkins,Is she okay?
Ann Perkins,"I left her, like, and her outgoing message is just her sobbing and burping and crazy laughing."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you know what?"
Ben Wyatt,She's actually handling it pretty well.
Leslie Knope,"What's up, fartwads?"
Chris Traeger,Are you eating a paunch burger?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,"If you can't beat 'em, join 'em."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I've been boycotting them ever since Pinewood and her goons started this whole recall business, but who cares now, right?"
Leslie Knope,What does it matter?
Leslie Knope,Nothing matters anymore.
Leslie Knope,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,This is good.
Leslie Knope,This is really good.
Leslie Knope,Why did I ever fight this?
Chris Traeger,Have you thought about a concession speech?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, concession speech?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I wrote one."
Chris Traeger,"""Eat my shorts, Jabronies."""
Chris Traeger,"""Knope, out."""
Ben Wyatt,I thought it best to revisit the concession speech at a later time.
Ben Wyatt,But we should focus on the haunted house.
Ben Wyatt,"And you know what I think it needs, actually, is a papier-mache Li'l Sebastian!"
Ann Perkins,What?
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna go fall asleep on a bench.
Joan Callamezzo,I can honestly say today's guest is the only person in this town who's a bigger deal than I am.
Joan Callamezzo,Please welcome lifestyle guru Annabel Porter.
Annabel Porter,"Hello, hello."
Annabel Porter,It's me.
Annabel Porter,I'm here.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, you are."
Annabel Porter,Hi.
Joan Callamezzo,"Can I just say, as a journalist, I feel like we're best friends."
Joan Callamezzo,Tell the audience about yourself.
Annabel Porter,"Well, I'm just a simple former phonebook model who found her calling."
Annabel Porter,"You know, I'm not perfect."
Joan Callamezzo,Oh.
Annabel Porter,The average woman worries about what she looks like in a bathing suit.
Annabel Porter,So does my nanny.
Annabel Porter,So I get it.
Joan Callamezzo,"Annabel, what trends are Pardon the pun, but Trending?"
Annabel Porter,"First of all, Mozambique cashmere is the new cast-iron stove."
Joan Callamezzo,Of course.
Annabel Porter,"I have found some amazing new conflict free paella recipes, and, luckily, my favorite fishmonger now makes house calls."
Joan Callamezzo,Thank God.
Donna Meagle,Finally.
Annabel Porter,But my fave new item is a deliciously bold chair
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.
Annabel Porter,By local artist Ron Swanson.
Joan Callamezzo,Ron Swanson is here.
Joan Callamezzo,"He will be joining us after the break, so stick around."
Ron Swanson,"Did that woman call my chair ""delicious""?"
Jerry Gergich,"Whoo, Happy Halloween."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, caterpillar!"
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Leslie Knope,Welcome to the den of horrors.
Extra,Where's all the scary stuff?
Leslie Knope,"Scary stuff is invisible, Leah. Broken dreams, disappointment, achieving your greatest goal and having it all fall apart and knowing that you'll never climb any higher."
Extra,Can we have some candy?
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna give you something sweeter than candy, Ryan. The truth."
Leslie Knope,It's very possible that some of you have already peaked.
Leslie Knope,"It's all downhill from here, turkeys."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's say goodbye to Ms. Knope, kids."
Leslie Knope,It is Ms. Knope.
Leslie Knope,"It's not city councilwoman Knope, because that chapter of my life is already over."
Leslie Knope,"Just remember, kids, nothing gold can stay."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, my goodness, we are back with America's greatest leader Annabel Porter and her new favorite artisan, local woodworker Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Annabel Porter,"I discovered Ron's chairs a few months ago, and what I absolutely love about a Swanson is you can really use it for anything."
Ron Swanson,"Yes, mostly you use it for sitting."
Annabel Porter,Make it a rustic accent piece in your solarium.
Annabel Porter,"Even better, use it as a focal point in your yoga tent."
Ron Swanson,Put it by a table and eat a meal.
Annabel Porter,We don't do meals in my home.
Annabel Porter,"No, every two hours, we eat what I like to call a food tease, like an oat wedge or a seaweed lozenge."
Joan Callamezzo,"Can I just say-- And I think this is really important, so I need everyone to shut up--  I love your hair."
Annabel Porter,Oh.
Annabel Porter,Thank you.
Annabel Porter,It's genetic and unattainable.
Chris Traeger,I am scaring you!
April Ludgate,I could see you.
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a million mirrors in front of me."
April Ludgate,"And you're never gonna make me not miss Andy, okay?"
Chris Traeger,What about this?
Chris Traeger,"I'm Bert Macklin, friendly lifeguard."
April Ludgate,Bert Macklin is not a lifeguard.
April Ludgate,He's an FBI agent.
Chris Traeger,Really?
Chris Traeger,That's even harder to believe.
April Ludgate,"Just stop, okay?"
April Ludgate,Your lame attempts at trying to cheer me up are not working.
April Ludgate,Now I'm sad that I miss Andy and sad that I can't make fun of you to Andy.
Chris Traeger,I understand.
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.
Chris Traeger,"I've failed you, both as a scary monster and a friend."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, I am really sorry."
Ben Wyatt,I know you must feel awful.
Leslie Knope,I don't feel awful.
Leslie Knope,"You know, actually, I feel like I can finally relax."
Leslie Knope,Accepting that you've peaked is very freeing.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I know the feeling."
Ben Wyatt,"I was impeached when I was 18, and it was brutal."
Ben Wyatt,But you just have to keep climbing back up that hill.
Leslie Knope,Or do you?
Leslie Knope,"Maybe instead of working super hard to rebuild your life, you just said, ""I peaked."""
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What a great run.
Leslie Knope,And now I'm going to spend the rest of my life really chill.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure, I mean, part of that sounds very appealing."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"But, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, see, iit was important for me-- See, I took a job in City budget crisis management, and now I work for a candy charity."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God, did I peak when I was 18?"
Leslie Knope,There it is.
Leslie Knope,Drink up.
Ben Wyatt,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,Shots!
Donna Meagle,B13 shots.
Donna Meagle,Bird bath salts.
Donna Meagle,Wha?
Donna Meagle,Champagne decanters!
Donna Meagle,This is heaven.
Extra,I love your chair.
Extra,I need 12 for my stepdaughter's craft room.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I make two a year, so maybe in six years."
Extra,Can you put me on the wait list?
Extra,Me too Unless your chair was ever touched by someone who ate refined sugar.
Extra,"Then I can't buy any of your chairs, and I protest this entire event."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Ron, Annabels coming over."
Tom Haverford,"When you talk me up, be sure to mention that you really admire how I take big risks with men's neck accessories."
Annabel Porter,There he is.
Annabel Porter,"Hello, hello."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you for your kind words about my chairs, Miss Porter."
Annabel Porter,"No, thank us."
Annabel Porter,You are about to make a ton of money.
Annabel Porter,I want to license your designs.
Annabel Porter,We are going to put Swanson chairs in every six bedroom home in the Midwest.
Ron Swanson,"If my chairs were mass produced, they wouldn't be Swanson chairs."
Ron Swanson,Swanson chairs are handmade.
Annabel Porter,"Yes, and now they will be made by thousands of tiny Chinese hands."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, Miss Porter, this is my very good friend Tom Haverford."
Ron Swanson,He's a big fan of your... Whatever you call what you do.
Ron Swanson,Please speak to each other while I leave.
Annabel Porter,"Oh, no, I am not done with you, you wicked little so-and-so."
Ron Swanson,Terrific.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"I had my time, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I did my thing.
Leslie Knope,"I wanted to be a city councilor, and I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!"
Leslie Knope,"And the people were like, pffft!"
Ben Wyatt,At least we have each other.
Leslie Knope,I love you so much.
Ben Wyatt,I love you too.
Leslie Knope,This is real.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Leslie Knope,You're my husband.
Ben Wyatt,You're my wife.
Leslie Knope,You married me in front of people.
Ben Wyatt,I did.
Ben Wyatt,I was there.
Leslie Knope,"We may have peaked, but it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,"We need to do something big, you know, something that really lets people know that we're gonna love each other forever."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah!
Ben Wyatt,What is it?
Leslie Knope,I got it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, sir."
Ben Wyatt,We are sober.
Leslie Knope,"We would like to get tattoos on our bodies, 'cause we love each other."
Herman,Tattoos?
Herman,This is a pawnshop.
Herman,"But, yeah, sure, I can do that."
Ben Wyatt,Awww!
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,It happened!
Leslie Knope,Look what he's doing.
Leslie Knope,He's breaking pens.
Ben Wyatt,This is the idea of the century.
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Tom Haverford,My store is called RentaSwag.
Tom Haverford,It's a clothing rental service for teens.
Annabel Porter,It's an interesting idea.
Annabel Porter,Are you guys doing well?
Tom Haverford,We're doing amazing.
Annabel Porter,Mm.
Tom Haverford,And it'd be perfect for Bloosh.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you take out whatever you wrote about my chairs and put something in about RentaSwag instead?
Annabel Porter,This month's trends are final.
Annabel Porter,I can't just throw a trend out.
Annabel Porter,But my Bloosh scouts have started trendtracking for the February zine blast.
Ron Swanson,"Good God, these words."
Annabel Porter,I'll have them stop by your store.
Tom Haverford,That'll be too late.
Tom Haverford,We'll be out of business by then.
Annabel Porter,I thought you said you were doing well.
Annabel Porter,"Ronnie, one last time, have you reconsidered mass production?"
Annabel Porter,I can sell your chairs on my site.
Ron Swanson,"No, thank you, ma'am."
Ron Swanson,I'm not interested in letting someone else sell my work.
Annabel Porter,"Well, that's too bad."
Annabel Porter,This party is over.
Annabel Porter,It no longer is.
Annabel Porter,It was.
Tom Haverford,It was?
Tom Haverford,That was my last shot.
Donna Meagle,"Sorry, Tommy."
Donna Meagle,Let's just grab some of that lychee body oil and bounce.
Tom Haverford,Can you grab me some of those pomegranate face masks too?
Donna Meagle,Fo' sho'.
Leslie Knope,Can I ask you a question?
Leslie Knope,Are we the cutest couple you've ever seen?
Herman,Nope.
Herman,"Okay, you want the long needle or the short needle?"
Herman,Doesn't matter.
Herman,Can't find a short needle.
Herman,Long needle it is.
Leslie Knope,I have a big idea.
Leslie Knope,"I want a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, tastefully done, and then she has a very classy tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm."
Leslie Knope,And that's very subtle.
Leslie Knope,"No, scratch that."
Leslie Knope,Scratch all that.
Leslie Knope,"Just write ""Ben""."
Ben Wyatt,Do you have anything to numb the pain?
Herman,"Sure, take a scoop out of the pill bucket."
Herman,"Okay, you said you wanted ""mouth queen""?"
Ann Perkins,"No, stop."
Ann Perkins,Stop it.
Ann Perkins,Stop everything that you're doing.
Ann Perkins,Stop it.
Leslie Knope,Ann's here!
Leslie Knope,Ann wants a tattoo!
Ben Wyatt,Ann!
Ann Perkins,"No, no!"
Leslie Knope,Ann!
Ann Perkins,No!
Ann Perkins,Shh!
Ann Perkins,Ann does not want a tattoo.
Ann Perkins,No one wants a tattoo.
Leslie Knope,"Ann, relax."
Leslie Knope,"Be ""respitable"" for a second, okay?"
Leslie Knope,What we are doing is not nuts.
Leslie Knope,We are merely getting tattoos so that everybody knows we love each other and that we haven't peaked.
Ben Wyatt,It makes a lot of sense.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, we're leaving, all right?"
Ann Perkins,So say goodbye to the nice man and thank me for saving you from being on Dateline.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, let's go."
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"Goodbye, world traveler."
Ben Wyatt,"Later, bro Heisen."
Ann Perkins,Go.
Ben Wyatt,Come on.
Tom Haverford," I don't want to be a failure again, Ron."
Ron Swanson, There's no shame in failure if you gave it an honest effort.
Tom Haverford, Easy for you to say.
Tom Haverford," People are dying to give you money for your business, and you didn't even take it."
Ron Swanson, I didn't sell my chairs to that website because I value my name.
Ron Swanson, The only thing that's important at the end of the day is what's on your gravestone-- Your name.
Tom Haverford, My gravestone's gonna be a 60-inch touchscreen with a hologram of four mes singing End of the Road by Boyz II Men But point taken.
Ann Perkins," Ben, what is the first rule of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force?"
Ben Wyatt,Don't let her get a tattoo.
Ann Perkins,What the hell happened?
Ben Wyatt,I couldn't help it.
Ben Wyatt, She's so cute when she's coming up with destructive ideas.
Ann Perkins, Never send a husband to do a best friend's job.
Ann Perkins," Out, Wyatt."
Ann Perkins, Walk it off.
Ann Perkins, - Walk it off.
Ben Wyatt, - Fine.
Leslie Knope, - You did it.
Ben Wyatt, - Yep.
Leslie Knope," - See you later, Ann."
Ann Perkins," - No, Knope, sit down."
Ann Perkins, - You are avoiding your problems.
Leslie Knope," - What? No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope, - Can we talk about this tomorrow?
Ann Perkins,You were down in the polls.
Ann Perkins, Your opponents were well funded and well organized.
Ann Perkins, You must have known this would be a possibility.
Leslie Knope," Intellectually, I knew that I might be in trouble, but deep in my heart, I never really thought"
Ann Perkins,"Ben and I tried to help you, but as usual, you're the best person for the job."
Ann Perkins,I wrote this. You need to hear yourself read this.
Leslie Knope," ""They held the recall election, and I lost."""
Leslie Knope,"""I was voted out of office."""
Leslie Knope,"""In 30 days, I will no longer be a Pawnee city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's so hard to read when you're drunk."
Ann Perkins, Keep going.
Leslie Knope," ""But I am Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am more than a city councilor."""
Leslie Knope,"""I am an unstoppable force of energy."""
Leslie Knope,"""And I will use those days to work as hard as I can."""
Ann Perkins,"These are all your ongoing projects, everything you're currently working on for Pawnee."
Ann Perkins, You have things to do.
Ann Perkins, You have a month left.
Ann Perkins, Use it.
Leslie Knope," Ann, you poetic and noble land mermaid, you're right once again."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Ben Wyatt, I flushed my car keys down the toilet.
Leslie Knope, No problem.
April Ludgate, Eww stop.
Ann Perkins," Hello to you too, April."
April Ludgate," I'm sorry I said you were lame, okay? You are, but I know you were just trying to help me, so"
Chris Traeger,"Thank you, April."
Chris Traeger, Happy Halloween.
Chris Traeger," And if you want to egg Larry's house, come find me."
April Ludgate, You guys are cute.
Ann Perkins,Where'd that come from?
April Ludgate,I'm weak.
April Ludgate," I miss Andy, and it's making me weak."
April Ludgate," Also, if Chris puts that much effort into making my stupid night better, I'm sure that he'll make your lame life perfect."
April Ludgate, Or he's secretly super in love with me.
April Ludgate, It's probably that.
Chris Traeger," That's a funny joke, April."
Chris Traeger," But the truth is, I'm very much in love with Ann."
April Ludgate," Okay, gross."
April Ludgate, The spell's broken.
Tom Haverford," I've made my decision, and I'll sell you Rent-a-Swag, but on my terms."
Trevor Nelson, Which are?
Tom Haverford,"40,000 for the inventory, the website, and everything else in the store, but I keep the name Rent-a-Swag."
Tom Haverford," It's mine, and I'm keeping it."
Trevor Nelson, The name is actually an important part of the sale.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Trevor Nelson,Yes.
Trevor Nelson, My client likes the name.
Trevor Nelson, It's better than Tommy's Closet.
Trevor Nelson, He needs the name.
Tom Haverford," Well, I don't know what to tell you, except I'll throw in the name in exchange for 20,000 more and 5% of your client's business."
Trevor Nelson," I'll run it past my client, but I think we have a deal."
Tom Haverford," Ron said there's nothing more valuable than my name, but he's not a businessman."
Tom Haverford, I am.
Tom Haverford, And now I have seed money for my next venture.
Tom Haverford," I sold out, baby."
Leslie Knope," The votes have been counted, and I have been recalled."
Leslie Knope," I am, of course, disappointed."
Leslie Knope," But I am still your City councilwoman for 30 more days, and I intend to spend every second I have left working for you and this great city."
Ben Wyatt, The thing about being part of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force is that it's a very easy job.
Ben Wyatt, She's never down for that long.
Ann Perkins," And now that she's had a little time to recharge, she is like a toddler bouncing back from a nap."
Leslie Knope, Hey! There you guys are.
Leslie Knope," Okay, Ben, I need some help with the re-zoning thing."
Leslie Knope," Also, I think we should paint our deck, so I have some color samples for you."
Leslie Knope," And to thank you both for being there when I needed you, I carved your faces into these Jack-o-lanterns."
Leslie Knope," Ann, it was very hard to capture your beauty, and, Ben, you make a sexy pumpkin"
Leslie Knope,No surprise.
Leslie Knope, Love you both.
Leslie Knope, See you later.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins, This is amazing.
Ben Wyatt, Not bad.

Andrew Luck,"We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!"
Jim Irsay,Who is ready to play 60?
Leslie Knope,Everybody on the field!
All,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,The NFL has a campaign to try to get kids active for 60 minutes per day.
Leslie Knope,"And so we bused in a hundred lucky, little buggers from Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,And they are gonna get a chance to play with the Colts.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Reggie!"
Leslie Knope,I told you to run a button hook.
Reggie Wayne,"I did, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I guess you would know.
Ron Swanson,"A pleasure to see you again, Mr. Luck."
Ron Swanson,We met briefly last year  at our friend's bachelor party.
Andrew Luck,"Oh, yeah."
Andrew Luck,Right.
Andrew Luck,How are you?
Ron Swanson,"I normally don't answer that question, but since I respect your talent, I will tell you I am fine."
April Ludgate,"Hi, I'm April."
April Ludgate,I stole your wallet.
Andrew Luck,You guys are weird.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
Robert Mathis,"What's up, girl?"
Donna Meagle,"Keep walking, 98."
Ben Wyatt,You don't even want to talk to that guy?
Ben Wyatt,He plays for the NFL.
Donna Meagle,He's a linebacker.
Donna Meagle,Skill positions only for Donna Meagle.
Tom Haverford,"I got my Colts beanie, my Colts scarf, I got the Colts grill going, and the crowning glory Colts slippies."
Adam Vinatieri,How are you going to run in those?
Tom Haverford,"""Run""?"
Tom Haverford,Tommy doesn't run.
Tom Haverford,That's your guys' job.
Tom Haverford,"Now, uh, let's go fetch this football throw, fellas."
Tom Haverford,I love sports.
Leslie Knope,"Check it out, Tom-- the Eagleton reservoir."
Leslie Knope,Isn't it stunning?
Tom Haverford,It's just a big dumb pond.
Tom Haverford,This morning I saw a YouTube clip of a little puppy riding a motorcycle.
Tom Haverford,"So my bar for ""stunning"" is pretty high."
Leslie Knope,What if I told you that this water has fluoride in it?
Tom Haverford,Then I would tell you the puppy had a little side car with a piggy in it named Hampton.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, send me a link to that video."
Leslie Knope,"But more importantly, now that we have access to the Eagleton reservoir and the water treatment supply, Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history."
Leslie Knope,Nailed it.
Leslie Knope,Of course I'm upset that I lost the recall election.
Leslie Knope,But I'm just gonna spend the remainder of my term cramming in as many good projects as I can.
Leslie Knope,Lame duck?
Leslie Knope,Try flame duck 'cause this duck is on fire.
Tom Haverford,It's hard doing stupid government stuff now that RentaSwag's closed.
Tom Haverford,I'm a businessman.
Tom Haverford,That's what I was born to do.
Leslie Knope,"Well, look, you just got to make the most of the job that you have."
Leslie Knope,"Like, take that trash collector."
Leslie Knope,"It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but he's doing it with a smile on his face."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,He's not wearing any pants.
Leslie Knope,What's wrong with him?
Tom Haverford,Let's get out of here.
Leslie Knope,He's smiling at us!
Leslie Knope,Let's go!
Leslie Knope,Run!
Chris Traeger,"Hey, what's up guys?"
Jerry Gergich,Look what Ron made.
Jerry Gergich,It's amazing.
Ron Swanson,"Several months ago, I was on a walk and found my crib tree."
Ron Swanson,"I approached the tree, murdered it, left it to cure in my woodshop, and have begun working it into a crib for my upcoming child."
Chris Traeger,"Ron Swanson, you cannot use this crib."
Chris Traeger,You're ignoring every known crib safety standard.
Chris Traeger,It's all covered in the parenting book I'm reading.
Chris Traeger,Are you going to crawl my way?
Chris Traeger,By Lenny Kravitz.
Ron Swanson,My crib will be safe because I'm building it with my own two hands.
Chris Traeger,"I bought my crib in Bloomington, and I am confident that it is literally the safest crib in the explored universe."
Chris Traeger,"Let me take you there, and you can talk to the salesperson."
Ron Swanson,"Counteroffer you take me nowhere, and I talk to no one."
Chris Traeger,"Counter-counteroffer you come with me, or I make you attend a four hour fax cover sheet protocol meeting."
Chris Traeger,"Either way, it's a win for me."
Leslie Knope,Next on the docket is a vote to approve the Pawnee Eagleton reservoir merger.
Jeremy Jamm,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
Jeremy Jamm,We're just goosing our water supply with fluoride?
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, come on."
Jeremy Jamm,Are we really gonna force every Pawnee resident to ingest a chemical we know nothing about?
Councilman Milton,Fluoride is used by the communists to control our minds.
Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."
Councilman Dexhart,Fluoride can control minds?
Councilman Dexhart,"Like, you can use it to make ladies do stuff?"
Leslie Knope,How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it."
Jeremy Jamm,"Ah, all right."
Jeremy Jamm,You got me.
Jeremy Jamm,"I don't want fluoride in the water because I'm a dentist, and I like cavities."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that is not a valid reason."
Jeremy Jamm,"Pawnee's cavity problem is why a small town dentist, like me, can afford such a boss ride."
Jeremy Jamm,Got an Asian girl to sit in it once.
Leslie Knope,Why did we come out here?
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,Fluoride in the water it's a no-brainer.
Leslie Knope,Can't you just let me have this one?
Jeremy Jamm,"No can do, Knopey."
Jeremy Jamm,"As a matter of fact, I would like to propose my own bill the Pawnee Clean Water Bill, which prohibits adding anything to our water supply forever."
Leslie Knope,"Jamm's not going to be able to kill this reservoir merger, is he?"
Leslie Knope,"On my side, I have facts, science, and reason."
Leslie Knope,All he has is fearmongering.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, he's gonna win."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, people get jittery about stuff like this."
Ben Wyatt,Remember last year when no one would get flu shots 'cause there was a rumor they turned you European?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'll figure something out."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, Jessica's here."
Ben Wyatt,I better go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Jessica Wicks,"Hey, sugar butt."
Jessica Wicks,"Some lardos in Muncie ate tainted Sweetums toffee sticks and diarrhea'd so much, they ended up in the hospital."
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Jessica Wicks,"Can we give their school, like, a new seesaw or something?"
Jessica Wicks,Yeah.
Jessica Wicks,Thanks.
Donna Meagle,The new site looks good.
Donna Meagle,Nice work.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, my God."
Craig Middlebrooks,These dogs are so cute.
Craig Middlebrooks,I want to throw up and kill myself.
April Ludgate,Animal control had to take in all the pets from Eagleton.
April Ludgate,"And Crazy Craig used to run all their shelters, so he helped me make an adoption website for all the dogs."
April Ludgate,If you can look at that site and not want to take home you're basically a war criminal.
April Ludgate,See the way that dog is rolling around in a puddle?
April Ludgate,That's something Andy does when he gets hot.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, you're right."
Donna Meagle,That is so Andy.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,That dog is totally Tom!
Donna Meagle,I don't know why.
Donna Meagle,It doesn't look like him.
Donna Meagle,But it just is.
Donna Meagle,It's like the dog is the essence of Tom.
April Ludgate,"Okay, important meeting in the conference room right now."
April Ludgate,We are going to all pick our spirit dogs.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle at the airport."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Larry, I swear to God, if you leave right now, we will make your spirit dog a miniature schnauzer."
Jerry Gergich,Is that bad?
Craig Middlebrooks,Yes!
Craig Middlebrooks,Get in there!
Chris Traeger,Ann found this place.
Chris Traeger,"It's where we bought our ""Sounds of Nature"" machine."
Ron Swanson,You bought a machine that replicates an open window?
Chris Traeger,Frasier!
Chris Traeger,Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger,Do you remember me?
Chris Traeger,"I came in here looking for the Vanna White book on child care, I'd like to solve the puzzle of parenting."
Chris Traeger,"Could you show my friend, Ron, that amazing crib that you sold me?"
Chris Traeger,The Babylove L'il Sweetheart Safe 4 Ever and Ever model.
Extra,"Oh, yeah, that thing is a deathtrap."
Chris Traeger,I'm sorry?
Extra,Just found out this morning it's being recalled.
Extra,They found maxicylofentabol in the glue.
Chris Traeger,Is that good?
Chris Traeger,It sounds bad.
Extra,It burned off my fingernails.
Ron Swanson,I'll be in the car.
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilwoman Leslie Knope wants to put fluoride, which is a chemical, into your drinking water."
Jeremy Jamm,You know what else is a chemical?
Jeremy Jamm,Strychnine and cyanide.
Leslie Knope,What?
Perd Hapley,And dirt and rust and even broken glass.
Jeremy Jamm,Exactly.
Jeremy Jamm,"You definitely understand what chemicals are, Perd."
Jeremy Jamm,"I would suggest if you want to contact the psychopath that wants to turn your kids into bad at math, communist fluoride zombies, well, just call the number at the bottom of your screen."
Leslie Knope,Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,Stop right there.
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride protects your teeth, and it's perfectly healthy for you."
Leslie Knope,"Well, if Jamm says that, then he is a lying idiot, and if you believe it, then so are you."
Tom Haverford,Whoa.
Tom Haverford,You just talked to that person like I talk to you.
Tom Haverford,You can't do that.
Leslie Knope,Why not?
Leslie Knope,"What are they gonna do, kick me out of office?"
Leslie Knope,Why did it take me so long to realize this?
Leslie Knope,There are no consequences to my actions anymore.
Leslie Knope,"No matter what I do, literally nothing bad can happen to me."
Leslie Knope,"I'm like a white, male U.S. senator."
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride is going into the water, moron."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, mom."
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Leslie Knope,Because all it does is prevent cavities!
Leslie Knope,God!
Leslie Knope,I expected more from you.
Leslie Knope,All right.
Leslie Knope,I'm a loose cannon.
Leslie Knope,We need to fight fire with fire.
Leslie Knope,"I call a town hall meeting, I gather everyone together, I distribute the binders, but now the binders are bright yellow!"
Leslie Knope,Boom!
Leslie Knope,Too extreme?
Tom Haverford,Too nothing.
Tom Haverford,"Look, Jamm's already ruined fluoride."
Tom Haverford,Everyone's scared of it.
Tom Haverford,What if we just called it something else?
Leslie Knope,What do you mean?
Tom Haverford,I mean we rebrand.
Tom Haverford,No one cared about Calvin Broadus until he started calling himself Snoop Doggy Dogg.
Tom Haverford,"Then when people got tired of that, he went by Snoop Dogg, and now he's Snoop Lion."
Tom Haverford,What's he gonna be in ten years? Snoop Laser Snake?
Tom Haverford,Who knows?
Leslie Knope,What are you saying we need to sex up fluoride?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,It's a pretty sexy topic already.
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you got to give people something to get excited about."
Tom Haverford,You told me to make the most of my job.
Tom Haverford,I'm good at this stuff.
Tom Haverford,"Now, are you a loose cannon or not?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,I'm as loose as a goose.
Leslie Knope,"Do your thing, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,Aw.
Donna Meagle,"Now, remember, it's about finding a dog that captures your spirit."
Donna Meagle,See?
Donna Meagle,This is Craig.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, no!"
Craig Middlebrooks,That is insane!
Craig Middlebrooks,I will burn this place to the ground if you pick that one!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, good choice."
April Ludgate,"You guys, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,Yes!
Jerry Gergich,And Ron Swanson.
Craig Middlebrooks,Oh!
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,This is Larry.
Jerry Gergich,That's great.
April Ludgate,Bingo.
April Ludgate,Donna.
April Ludgate,Nailed it.
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
April Ludgate,Because you're pretty and you like makeup and stuff.
Donna Meagle,Game over.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, I want to do things the Swanson way."
Ron Swanson,Wonderful.
Ron Swanson,First rule no conversation lasts longer than 100 total words.
Ron Swanson,You have used 9.
Ron Swanson,I have used 20.
Ron Swanson,Continue.
Chris Traeger,Fun.
Chris Traeger,I'd like you to teach me to build a crib.
Ron Swanson,Why do you need to build your own crib?
Chris Traeger,Because I no longer trust anything other than my own two hands.
Chris Traeger,"It is debilitating, but exciting."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, we'll go to my woodshop at lunch."
Chris Traeger,Wonderful.
Chris Traeger,Look at us both standing on the cusp of fatherhood.
Chris Traeger,"I know we haven't spent a lot of time together,  but"
Ron Swanson,100
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, so, in conclusion fluoride, chemical, tiny genitals, misinformation, panic, death, Jenny McCarthy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I don't know, councilman."
Leslie Knope,That was a little dry.
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we have some fun, huh?"
Leslie Knope,Check this.
Kyle,Plain water?
Kyle,Yuck.
Kyle,I'm bored.
Tom Haverford,Then try this.
Kyle,What the what just happened?
Tom Haverford,"That water contains teeth dazzler, which makes your teeth stronger and starts a party in your mouth."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Fluoride's boring, guys."
Leslie Knope,Boo!
Leslie Knope,Welcome to Tdazzle.
Leslie Knope,It's not a chemical.
Leslie Knope,It's an aquatic based social media oral experience.
Tom Haverford,Everyone who tweets at T-Dazzle in the next hour will be entered to win an exciting plain blue Tshirt.
Tom Haverford,"I say ""T,"" you say ""dazzle."""
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
All,"""Dazzle."""
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
All,"""Dazzle."""
Tom Haverford,"""T."""
All,"""Dazzle."""
Chris Traeger,"Thank you for the woodworking lesson, Ron."
Chris Traeger,This whole crib recall thing has got me literally rethinking everything I thought I knew about parenting.
Chris Traeger,"What sleep method will you be using Ferber, Sears?"
Ron Swanson,"Swanson method, where you close your eyes and fall asleep."
Chris Traeger,"I really wish Ron would engage, but he exudes so much wisdom that I can learn parenting tips simply by being in his presence."
Chris Traeger,Someone like Ron is teaching even when they're not teaching.
Chris Traeger,Does that make sense?
Chris Traeger,My anxiety has kept me up for over 50 hours.
Leslie Knope,"Our polling shows that 72% of citizens are in favor of adding Tdazzle to their water, effectively killing Councilman Jamm's so-called Clean Water Bill."
Leslie Knope,"Eat it, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,I won.
Jeremy Jamm,Apology accepted.
Jeremy Jamm,"You know, I've actually come around to your way of thinking on this."
Jeremy Jamm,"My only thought is, why stop here?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Ladies and gentlemen, Sweetums president Jessica Wicks."
Jessica Wicks,Whoo!
Jessica Wicks,"Look, we all love T-Dazzle."
Jessica Wicks,But we can do more to improve our drinking supply.
Jessica Wicks,Sweetums is excited to propose an alternative to boring municipal water.
Jessica Wicks,"We call it ""Drinkems""!"
Jessica Wicks,Whoo!
Jeremy Jamm,Sweetums is prepared to take over the management of Pawnee's water.
Jeremy Jamm,This is gonna save this town beaucoup bucks.
Jeremy Jamm,Take a sip of this delicious water and imagine it coming out of your faucets at home.
Leslie Knope,This water is filled with sugar.
Leslie Knope,There's absolutely no way we are doing this.
Jeremy Jamm,Too late. We're going to fill the whole reservoir with this stuff.
Jeremy Jamm,Checkmate.
Leslie Knope,Did you bring those with you just to do that?
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe.
Tom Haverford,Damn.
Tom Haverford,It is a baller move.
Tom Haverford,"What are we gonna do now, Leslie?"
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate,"Okay, are you still mad at me about the poodle thing?"
April Ludgate,It was just a dumb game.
April Ludgate,I can pick another dog.
Donna Meagle,I'm not mad about the choice.
Donna Meagle,I'm mad about your reasons.
Donna Meagle,"""Pretty,"" ""makeup"" is that all you know about me?"
April Ludgate,We don't hang out that much.
April Ludgate,It's not like you know a ton about me.
Donna Meagle,"You're beautiful, yet cold and aloof."
Donna Meagle,You pride yourself on being a loner.
Donna Meagle,"You do not obey, you choose to cooperate."
Donna Meagle,"And when you stop baring your fangs to pick a mate, it's for life."
Donna Meagle,"And you're fiercely loyal to your pack, which makes you a rare black Siberian husky."
Craig Middlebrooks,"That was so spot on, it was scary."
Craig Middlebrooks,I need to go lie down for 45 minutes.
Craig Middlebrooks,"No, an hour. A full hour."
Leslie Knope,Good morning.
Leslie Knope,This won't take long.
Leslie Knope,"Simply put, it would be madness to let Sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar."
Leslie Knope,What's next cookie dough toothpaste?
Leslie Knope,Bad example.
Leslie Knope,That would be amazing.
Leslie Knope,"My point is, Sweetums is an evil, profit hungry corporation that is ruining our health."
Leslie Knope,"Ever since Sweetums opened its doors, obesity is up 100%."
Leslie Knope,It's unacceptable.
Leslie Knope,Down with that poison peddling corporate monster.
Leslie Knope,Down with Sweetums!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Heard about your speech.
Ben Wyatt,Sounded great.
Leslie Knope,I wish you could've seen it.
Leslie Knope,It felt so good.
Leslie Knope,I love loose cannoning.
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love the power of no consequences."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, unfortunately, there has been one consequence."
Ben Wyatt,I just got fired from Sweetums.
Leslie Knope,Because you were embezzling I hope.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jessica!"
Leslie Knope,Did you do something to your hair?
Leslie Knope,"Because, sister, you look good enough to eat."
Leslie Knope,Num num num num num.
Jessica Wicks,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,You can't punish Ben for something I did.
Leslie Knope,It's not fair.
Leslie Knope,"I love him, and I will do anything to help him get his job back."
Leslie Knope,What do you want?
Jessica Wicks,I want you to formally apologize for what you said about Sweetums.
Jessica Wicks,"I want you to say that we're a moral, upstanding corporation that you're proud to have in Pawnee."
Jessica Wicks,"And when you make your apology, I want you to wear a limegreen pantsuit because it will look horrible on you."
Jessica Wicks,You are such an autumn.
Donna Meagle,Did you need me for something?
April Ludgate,"Yes, I want to figure out your spirit dog, and I'm going to do that by learning everything there is to know about you."
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Game on.
April Ludgate,"Okay, what's your favorite color?"
Donna Meagle,"For cars, it's gold."
Donna Meagle,"For shoes, it's red unless it's the weekend, then reverse them."
April Ludgate,Favorite music?
Donna Meagle,"1970s funk and 1770s opera and Sugar Ray, post Mark McGrath after he left for Entertainment Tonight."
April Ludgate,Favorite book?
Donna Meagle,Downton Abbey.
April Ludgate,That's not a
Donna Meagle,Downton… Abbey.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Um, describe your perfect Sunday."
Donna Meagle,"Church, do the Harper's Magazine Acrostic, play my oboe in the jacuzzi while the sun sets over puget sound."
April Ludgate,Favorite movies?
Donna Meagle,"In order Natural Born Killers, Remains of the Day, and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey."
April Ludgate,Excellent.
April Ludgate,Thank you very much for your time.
April Ludgate,I will have your answer shortly.
April Ludgate,No idea.
Ron Swanson,"If a joint is properly fashioned, all you need to do is guide it into place."
Chris Traeger,"""All you need to do is guide it into place."""
Chris Traeger,"What I get from that is, when parenting, sometimes a subtle hand is more effective than a strong one."
Chris Traeger,This is already so much more helpful than the last book on parenting I read: Rad Dads by Apolo Anton Ohno and Shaun White.
Ron Swanson,Nah.
Chris Traeger,"Ron, why did you throw that wood away?"
Ron Swanson,It's unstable.
Ron Swanson,It's no good.
Chris Traeger,"I just don't understand ""the throwing away the wood"" metaphor."
Chris Traeger,What's the lesson?
Chris Traeger," Oh, I know!"
Chris Traeger, It's potty training.
Chris Traeger," That trash can is the toilet, and the wood was the feces."
Ron Swanson," Chris, I'm not teaching you anything."
Ron Swanson, We're just building a crib.
Chris Traeger," No, I know you're not consciously teaching me anything."
Chris Traeger," I'm trying to siphon off some of your calm, centered wisdom through metaphors."
Ron Swanson, Metaphors? I hate metaphors.
Ron Swanson," That's why my favorite book is Moby Dick-- no froufrou symbolism, just a good, simple tale about a man who hates an animal."
Ron Swanson," That's enough for today, I think."
Chris Traeger, - An organized child is a--
Ron Swanson,No.
April Ludgate," Okay, I've been working on this for three hours, and I know your spirit dog."
April Ludgate," You are a Nova Scotia toller, because you're outgoing and adventurous."
April Ludgate," And you love Canada? No, that's not right."
Donna Meagle,"No, it isn't."
Donna Meagle, But I appreciate the effort.
Donna Meagle, We're good.
Donna Meagle, And don't beat yourself up.
Donna Meagle, You'll probably never guess what kind of dog I am.
April Ludgate, You're right.
April Ludgate," I'll never guess what kind of dog you are, because you're not a dog."
April Ludgate, You're a cat.
April Ludgate, You're temperamental.
April Ludgate," You're unpredictable, complex, and hard to read."
April Ludgate, You make people work before you let them in.
April Ludgate," But if they put the time in and prove that they care, then you open yourself up to them."
April Ludgate," Right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Donna Meagle, Hmm.
Leslie Knope," ""So let's all raise a glass, full of delicious, sugary drinking water, to Sweetums-- a Pawnee Institution."""
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, don't do this."
Leslie Knope," I have to, Ben."
Leslie Knope, We can't both be out of a job.
Leslie Knope," What will we do-- sleep all day, take cooking classes together, sit on a couch and watch movies?"
Leslie Knope,"God, that sounds horrible."
Ben Wyatt,There's more at stake here.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, if you apologize, it'll be an endorsement - for the Drink-ems plan."
Leslie Knope,"I know that, but--"
Ben Wyatt,And everything you said about Sweetums was right on.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, 90% of the charity work I did was to compensate for messes they caused."
Ben Wyatt, And I don't want to work for them anymore.
Leslie Knope, Are you sure?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, just go up there, stick to your guns."
Leslie Knope, It's not gonna make a difference.
Leslie Knope, I can't beat them.
Leslie Knope," All I have on my side is facts and science, and people hate facts and science."
Leslie Knope, Wait.
Leslie Knope, I have an idea.
Leslie Knope, Go get Tom.
Leslie Knope, Run! Get Tom!
Leslie Knope,Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things about Sweetums and their great new product.
Leslie Knope," But when I looked at the research, I found some pretty compelling facts about Drink-ems that made me change my tune."
Leslie Knope, Each Drink-ems is packed with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement.
Leslie Knope, MPP is an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 PH buffer.
Leslie Knope," Now, I know what you're thinking-- what about its molar mass?"
Leslie Knope,How does 136.086 grab you?
Leslie Knope,What the--
Tom Haverford,"I don't know about y'all, but Drink-ems seems pretty boring to me, not like H-2-flow."
Leslie Knope, Excuse me.
Leslie Knope, I have several binders with very important data that I need to get through.
Tom Haverford," Well, miss, I think we'd all appreciate it if you just swallowed a teaspoon of hush."
Tom Haverford, Think of H-2-flow as an app for your teeth.
Tom Haverford," The more flow you take in, the more sparkle points you get."
Tom Haverford," Get enough sparkle points, and you're on your way to your first aqua badge!"
Tom Haverford,"Collect enough aqua badges, and we'll welcome you to the H-2-flow Platinum Club."
Tom Haverford," I'm great at business, and I'm great at parks stuff."
Tom Haverford, I'm like Picasso meets Michael Jordan.
Tom Haverford," I can paint, but, uh, I can also be a world-class gambler."
Chris Traeger," Ron, what's this?"
Ron Swanson,The crib I built.
Ron Swanson, I'm giving it to you and Ann.
Ron Swanson, It's perfectly safe.
Ron Swanson, I tested it by hitting it with my truck.
Chris Traeger," Well, Ron, I can't accept."
Chris Traeger, This is for your baby.
Ron Swanson, There's more than one crib tree in a forest.
Ron Swanson," That's not a lesson, by the way, just a comment on lumber availability."
Chris Traeger, It's beautiful.
Chris Traeger, Thank you.
Ron Swanson," Nobody has all the right answers in parenting, including me."
Ron Swanson, And that toxic crib you bought won't be the last mistake you make.
Ron Swanson, But a man who's this worried about making all the right choices cares very much.
Ron Swanson, That's all that matters.
Ron Swanson, You'll be a great father.
Chris Traeger," Thank you, Ron for the crib and the advice."
Chris Traeger, It's much better than any metaphor.
Ron Swanson, Does the white whale actually symbolize the unknowability and meaninglessness of human existence? No.
Ron Swanson, It's just a [bleep] fish.
Leslie Knope," Hey, good news."
Leslie Knope, Drink-ems is dead.
Leslie Knope," As of tomorrow, every Pawnee resident will have H-2-flow in their drinking water."
Ben Wyatt, That's great news.
Ben Wyatt," H-2-flow is fluoride, right?"
Leslie Knope,I think so.
Leslie Knope," I'll double-check with Tom, but I'm, like, 95% sure."
Ben Wyatt, Wow.
Ben Wyatt, Look at us.
Ben Wyatt," Two people, who are about to have zero jobs."
Ben Wyatt," Weird, huh?"
Leslie Knope,"And you and I-- we always land on our feet, right?"
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh! Guess who won that plain blue T-shirt?
Ben Wyatt,No way! Look how blue it is.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Things are already looking up.
Ben Wyatt, Yeah!

,Season: 6 Episode: 08
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Ben Wyatt,"No, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,Yes?
Ben Wyatt,I got fired from running the Sweetums Foundation.
Leslie Knope,Thanks to me.
Leslie Knope,"Sorry, again."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, blessing in disguise."
Ben Wyatt,"I took a job at this accounting firm, they've tried to hire me three times, I finally gave in."
Ben Wyatt,"But I've had a week off in between jobs, and I've been cooking up something pretty big."
Leslie Knope,"The last time he was in between jobs, he got deep into claymation, so this should be different, hopefully."
Ben Wyatt,"Presenting ""The Cones of Dunshire,"" a brand new gaming experience."
Ben Wyatt,"Two wizards, a Maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the ledgerman just keeps score, and he wears this hat."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, the object is to accumulate cones."
Ben Wyatt,"Four cones wins, but in order to get a cone, you have to build a civilization."
Ben Wyatt,The other amazing thing is the challenge play.
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, let me tell you more about the trivia cards, 'cause you're gonna need to know about roadblocks first."
Ben Wyatt,"Nah, never mind."
Ben Wyatt,The thing about the challenge play is that it's basically the game… in reverse.
Ben Wyatt,Then you roll three dice to see how many dice you roll with.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, 16."
Ben Wyatt,"Perfect, lots of choices."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, each turn goes: Roll, buy, action."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously, this would be much taller in the real game."
Ben Wyatt,But the corporal can veto.
Ben Wyatt,This should be green too.
Ben Wyatt,How did this happen?
Ben Wyatt,Are the cones a metaphor?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, yes and no."
Leslie Knope,What is this called again?
Ben Wyatt,"""The Cones of Dunshire."""
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, the Maverick should be able to trade lumber for agriculture credits."
Ben Wyatt,How have I not thought of this before?
Ben Wyatt,"This is nothing, right?"
Leslie Knope,When do you go back to work again?
Ben Wyatt,Tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,It's fine.
Ben Wyatt,I'll just throw this in the garbage.
Jeremy Jamm,"As soon as Knope is gone, these are going up all over Chambers."
Jeremy Jamm,Jamm for three!
Leslie Knope,Ha ha!
Leslie Knope,"What, are you trying to build a house with those bricks?"
Councilman Milton,Ooh!
Councilman Milton,The girl is attacking me.
Councilman Howser,Any new business before we adjourn?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I have one the Pawnee Commons."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"The money for the Pawnee Commons, aka the greatest future park in the world, aka my personal dream project is currently in a discretionary fund."
Leslie Knope,"I'd like to move it to a lockbox, to ensure that it is used for that project."
Jeremy Jamm,"The thing is, Leslie, this kind of decision is it's not really up to you anymore."
Jeremy Jamm,"Because the voters, to use a technical political term, gave you the stanky boot."
Jeremy Jamm,"But we'll keep your money safe, baby girl."
Jeremy Jamm,"What, you think I'm gonna use it to put a new limestone shower in my office?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, now I do."
Jeremy Jamm,"I propose that we table this discussion until, let's say, the second Knope is gone."
Jeremy Jamm,"Later, bunheads."
Jeremy Jamm,Glass!
Tom Haverford,Video Ron demand.
Tom Haverford,"What you carrying, my dude?"
Ron Swanson,The time has come to sell my cabin.
Ron Swanson,But I haven't had much luck finding a buyer.
April Ludgate,"""For sale."""
April Ludgate,"""Small house."""
April Ludgate,"""Location: Forest."""
April Ludgate,"It's a little wordy, don't you think?"
Donna Meagle,"""Current owner will not clean up shotgun shells or animal carcasses."""
Donna Meagle,"The hell is wrong with you, Swanson?"
Ron Swanson,"Fine, I'll clean up the shotgun shells, but the carcasses remain to fertilize my berry patch."
Donna Meagle,"If you really want to unload that little horror cabin, you gonna need a professional to stage it properly."
Donna Meagle,"Lucky for you, I recently got my real estate license."
Donna Meagle,Spladow!
Donna Meagle,Check it.
Ron Swanson,"""Regal Meagle Realty."""
Ron Swanson,"""Find your castle."""
Ron Swanson,"Fine, I suppose I could use some help."
Tom Haverford,"Yo, Donna, let me get a little skin in the game, maybe split that commission?"
Donna Meagle,All right.
Donna Meagle,Show me what you got.
Donna Meagle,I'll split that commish.
Donna Meagle,Split that commish
Tom Haverford,Split that commish
Tom Haverford,"The question I always ask myself is, what kind of mogul should I be?"
Tom Haverford,"Fashion mogul, energy drink mogul."
Tom Haverford,I even thought about downhill skiing.
Tom Haverford,A mogul mogul.
Tom Haverford,But a real estate mogul?
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,That's a hot mogul right now.
Ben Wyatt,"Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty."
Ben Wyatt,"How you doing, Barney?"
Ben Wyatt,Good to see you again.
Barney,I just can't believe it's finally happening.
Barney,Ted!
Barney,He's here!
Barney,He really came!
Frank,"Hello, Ben."
Frank,I'm Frank.
Frank,I took the job when you passed it up last time.
Frank,Heard a lot about you.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all good things, I hope."
Frank,A little too good.
Frank,Let's see if you live up to the hype.
Frank,I'm not joking.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Frank seems cool.
Leslie Knope,"Well, tell everybody in Michigan I said hi, and tell your mom that I love the banana cake she posted on Pinterest."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, the father of your child is here."
Leslie Knope,I have to go.
Leslie Knope,I'll talk to you soon.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Chris Traeger,Was that Ann?
Chris Traeger,I hope you were speaking to her in a calming voice 'cause babies can hear everything.
Chris Traeger,"Baby, if you can still hear me, I love you."
Leslie Knope,The phone is hung up.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, sorry."
Leslie Knope,You got my message about Jamm being a dinkhead?
Chris Traeger,"Yes, but as city manager, I can't play sides."
Chris Traeger,And I think all of our heads can be a little dinky at times.
Leslie Knope,"Fine, but his is the dinkiest."
Leslie Knope,And I would know because I'm keeping score.
Leslie Knope,"Ever since I started city council, I have gone head-to-head with Jamm 112 times."
Leslie Knope,"He has won 56 times, I have won 56 times."
Leslie Knope,I will not lose our last battle.
Leslie Knope,Will you help me?
Chris Traeger,No.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"The way you stood up like that, I thought it was gonna go a different way."
Chris Traeger,"No, I can't help directly, but I am on your side."
Chris Traeger,And I will assist you in any way that I can.
Chris Traeger,"Maybe I can mediate, like Dr. Phil, only qualified."
Tom Haverford,"So what's the story, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Diane making you sell this place?
Ron Swanson,Not at all.
Ron Swanson,"Recently, I purchased a new cabin big enough for the whole family."
Ron Swanson,I just can't justify owning four cabins.
Ron Swanson,Two cabins.
Ron Swanson,"The new cabin I bought has a great tire swing for the girls, access to a lake for all the kids to play in."
Ron Swanson,"Plus, it doesn't have these razorsharp perimeter defense planks sticking out of the ground."
Donna Meagle,"I usually get a 5% commission, but I'll do it for 3%."
Donna Meagle,Friends and family discount.
Ron Swanson,Make it 5%.
Ron Swanson,I don't want you getting any ideas about us being friends.
Donna Meagle,Respect.
Tom Haverford,"Donna, baby."
Tom Haverford,"For the fireplace, I'm thinking fake antlers."
Tom Haverford,But what kind of scarves do we want to hang off the fake antlers?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, duh."
Tom Haverford,Crocheted.
Donna Meagle,Most def.
Donna Meagle,"That'll look legit next to those antique ""Visit France"" posters."
Tom Haverford,Mm.
April Ludgate,"Ron, you want to stay outside and do nothing while they make your cabin look like garbage?"
Ron Swanson,I'd like that very much.
Ron Swanson,We can watch the shadows get longer.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Wow, you guys sure take the startup paperwork seriously around here."
Barney,"Sorry to start you out like this, and on a Friday no less."
Barney,But it's our toughest case.
Barney,"Three competing family trusts, a contested will-- it's a real puzzler!"
Frank,"So let's see what you got, genius."
Ben Wyatt,"If I'm murdered tonight, start the investigation with those two guys."
Jeremy Jamm,The hell you nerds doing here?
Leslie Knope,We're not done talking about the lockbox.
Leslie Knope,This isn't over.
Chris Traeger,And I am here to mediate.
Jeremy Jamm,You can't just show up at my door like this.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I know we have had our differences, but this is very important to me."
Leslie Knope,And I'm not leaving until we hash this out.
Jeremy Jamm,"I respect the moxie, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,You can come in for a minute.
Jeremy Jamm,Shoes off.
Jeremy Jamm,This is a house of respect.
Chris Traeger,"Well, I don't need to do that."
Chris Traeger,My feet are very clean.
Jeremy Jamm,"No shoes, you lose."
Leslie Knope,"""No shoes, you lose""?"
Leslie Knope,"That means we should have shoes then, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,No shoes... Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, so this is my weekend dojo."
Jeremy Jamm,"Sorry, the place is a bit of a mess."
Jeremy Jamm,My wife's in Oklahoma for eight months.
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe forever.
Jeremy Jamm,We'll see if she forgives me.
Leslie Knope,"Who's that, Michelle Wie?"
Jeremy Jamm,It's not sexual.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm just a really big fan of her game.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Because in that picture, she's wearing a bikini."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, thanks."
Jeremy Jamm,Photoshopped it myself.
Leslie Knope,Fantastic.
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, this is about the time I hit the hay, so"
Leslie Knope,Why don't we all hit the hay?
Leslie Knope,"We'll stay here, get a good night's sleep, and we can start negotiations tomorrow."
Leslie Knope,We stopped at the outlet mall on the way here.
Leslie Knope,"Got ourselves a sleeping bag, a giant tin of caramel corn, and an irregular skirt from DKNY."
Leslie Knope,"The hem is crooked, but it was 8 bucks."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, I am not leaving until I get that lockbox."
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, playing hardball, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, no sweat off my sack."
Jeremy Jamm,"You can take the couch, if you can get my exercise equipment out of the way."
Leslie Knope,I think I can handle it.
Jeremy Jamm,"How sweet is this table, by the way, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,I got it from an actual benihana.
Jeremy Jamm,Cost me 4 grand.
Jeremy Jamm,Worth every penny.
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!
Jeremy Jamm,Can I interest anyone in an authentic Japanese abreakafast?
Leslie Knope,Scrambled eggs eaten with chopsticks?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Jeremy Jamm,Hai!
Leslie Knope,"You know, maybe we should negotiate  while we're eating."
Jeremy Jamm,"No, what's the rush?"
Jeremy Jamm,Plenty of time for that later.
Leslie Knope,You know what might put you in the mood to talk is a couple of brewskis and a calendar featuring some of your favorite female wrestlers.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,"Knope, you know the way to a man's heart."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, okay."
Jeremy Jamm,Let's talk.
Jeremy Jamm,You got it.
Ron Swanson,These people won't leave.
Ron Swanson,One guy even looked in the bathroom.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, that means they like the place."
Donna Meagle,"If you just leave them alone, I think we might get some offers."
Tom Haverford,This evergreen scented candle should help put people in the mood to buy.
Ron Swanson,You could just open the door and let the actual smell of the pines in.
Tom Haverford,"Trees are sticky, and they got bugs in them."
Extra,This place is so random.
Extra,I don't know.
Extra,"It's kind of, like, in the middle of nowhere."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,"That's, like, the hilarious part."
April Ludgate,It's like a joke how long it takes to get here.
April Ludgate,It's like a meta-cabin.
Extra,Oh yeah.
Extra,"That's what I thought, yeah."
April Ludgate,I heard that Dave Eggers wrote a short story about this tape cassette that he found under that tree over there.
Extra,"Oh, my God."
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
April Ludgate,I'm trying to get these annoying dumdums to pay more money for your cabin.
Ron Swanson,Carry on.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I heard that Neko Case and Ben Gibbard made out here once."
Extra,What?
Barney,Saturday at the firm with Ben.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we dissolve the loanout and file bankruptcy."
Ben Wyatt,That way only our clients have claim to the assets.
Frank,Great idea that we had a month ago.
Frank,"The problem is, the trust still has claim to the property."
Ben Wyatt,Then we dissolve the trust.
Ben Wyatt,"Clients ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""F,"" they would have to agree, but if they went for it, we could arbitrate."
Frank,He's right.
Frank,We never thought of that.
Barney,"Oh, oh!"
Barney,"Ben, Ben."
Barney,"Say it again but this time I'm gonna turn the light on, like you just had an idea."
Ben Wyatt,"Sure, sure."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I'm with you."
Ben Wyatt,"Um, okay."
Ben Wyatt,What if we dissolve the trust?
Barney,Yes!
Barney,You just cracked the case.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just doing my job.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,"Maybe we name part of the park  the ""Jamm Zone""?"
Jeremy Jamm,Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, Jamm could dig on that."
Jeremy Jamm,"How about if in the Jamm zone, there's no married chicks allowed?"
Chris Traeger,"Caution, Jeremy."
Chris Traeger,"I think there are people that will find the ""No Married Chicks"" zone both morally repugnant and hard to enforce."
Jeremy Jamm,All right.
Jeremy Jamm,"Listen, let us celebrate this progress by sharing these authentic edamame, or Tokyo beans."
Jeremy Jamm,Now I want you to be very careful about eating these.
Jeremy Jamm,"You eat the shells, and you throw the seeds out."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,You have really immersed yourself in Asian culture.
Leslie Knope,Now I think maybe we should revisit the holding bond idea.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ugh, Lezzie."
Jeremy Jamm,"Come on, I'm getting bored."
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, we've been at this for hours."
Jeremy Jamm,Can we please take a break?
Chris Traeger,Perhaps he has a point.
Chris Traeger,And we've made some progress.
Chris Traeger,Maybe we go home and take the rest of it up on Monday.
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait until Monday."
Leslie Knope,I need to close this deal now.
Leslie Knope,So I have an idea.
Leslie Knope,Let's have a change of venue and keep negotiating while we have fun.
Leslie Knope,"If I remember correctly, you enjoy the ancient art of karaoke, yes?"
Jeremy Jamm,I do.
Jeremy Jamm,And kudos on that pronunciation.
Leslie Knope,I remembered your favorite duet.
Leslie Knope,Maybe it's time to take this party to Rydell High.
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to hear your Travolta.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, no, no, no."
Jeremy Jamm,I'm Sandra Dee.
Jeremy Jamm,That's more of my register.
Jeremy Jamm,You're Zuko.
Jeremy Jamm,"He got friendly, holdin' my hand "
Leslie Knope,She got friendly down in the sand 
Jeremy Jamm,"He was sweet, just turned 18"
Leslie Knope,"Well, she was good, you know what I mean?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh  summer heat boy and girl meet   but ah, oh, those summer nights"
Leslie Knope,"Uh  summer heat boy and girl meet   but ah, oh, those summer nights"
Chris Traeger,I would like to buy five DVDs of this.
Chris Traeger,"No, 20."
Chris Traeger,"No, 60!"
Chris Traeger,"No, that's insane."
Leslie Knope,Dubee doo dubee doo  dubee dubee dubee dow
Tom Haverford,Good news.
Tom Haverford,We have multiple bidders.
Tom Haverford,That guy's getting his financials together.
Tom Haverford,"Plans on tearing the whole place down, just wants it for the land."
Ron Swanson,Why would he want to tear down a perfectly good cabin?
Donna Meagle,"I think he's a developer, wants to put in a luxury glampground."
Donna Meagle,"Glamping is ""glamour camping."""
Donna Meagle,"Heated tents, catered meals, wifi"
Ron Swanson,You're describing a hotel.
Tom Haverford,And I think we still have traction with those two.
Extra,"Oh, hey, man."
Extra,I love the mustache.
Extra,So funny.
Extra,"You ever think about twisting it up at the ends, huh?"
Extra,Use a little beeswax?
Ron Swanson,The open house is now closed.
Ron Swanson,We are not accepting bids at this time.
Ron Swanson,The sun sets in 95 minutes.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Tom Haverford,That's part of the charm of this whole place-- the cantankerous old coot who owns it.
Tom Haverford,It's authentic!
Leslie Knope,"I gotta say, that was pretty fun up there."
Leslie Knope,"We have fun when we collaborate, right?"
Leslie Knope,Working together?
Leslie Knope,"Lockbox, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"You know, in some weird, perverted, sexual way, I'm gonna miss you when you're gone."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Jeremy Jamm,You are my Nemesis.
Jeremy Jamm,You're the Superman to my Lex Luthor.
Leslie Knope,You want to be Lex Luthor?
Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, yeah."
Jeremy Jamm,Lex Luthor is rich.
Leslie Knope,"Well, okay."
Leslie Knope,I can't argue with that.
Leslie Knope,So I did Zuko for you.
Leslie Knope,Now you give me the lockbox.
Chris Traeger,"Leslie put a beautiful cross into the box, Jeremy."
Chris Traeger,Time for you to head it in.
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,What can I say?
Jeremy Jamm,You wore me down.
Jeremy Jamm,"I will give you my word, and I will put it in writing, so I can't back out."
Jeremy Jamm,We won't touch the money for one year.
Jeremy Jamm,"And if the economy holds up, you can start construction then."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have your lockbox."
Chris Traeger,And you scored a triple dragon on your song.
Leslie Knope,"No, I cannot wait a year."
Leslie Knope,I want to get started now.
Leslie Knope,I want construction started on Monday.
Chris Traeger,You have his word.
Chris Traeger,"And this is riddled with spelling errors,  but it is binding."
Leslie Knope,It's not good enough!
Leslie Knope,"Jamm, I sang your stupid song, I ate your stupid fake Asian food, and by the way, you should know, you don't make sushi rolls out of tuna salad"
Jeremy Jamm,Maybe you don't.
Leslie Knope,"I did practically everything you wanted, and you won't just give this to me today?"
Leslie Knope,Screw you!
Leslie Knope,You're giving a card to me?
Chris Traeger,You left me no choice.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Chris Traeger,"Please, could you excuse us?"
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you should be happy!"
Chris Traeger,You beat Jamm in the final battle.
Chris Traeger,Unless there's something more going on here.
Leslie Knope,Ann.
Leslie Knope,This is about Ann.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins?
Chris Traeger,I love Ann Perkins.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee Commons is why I met Ann five years ago.
Leslie Knope,And I know you guys are talking about moving.
Leslie Knope,"But I guess I thought if maybe Ann came back from Michigan tomorrow, and I was able to look into her smoky, ethnically ambiguous eyes and tell her that we were breaking ground on a new park, she might... she might want to stay."
Chris Traeger,"Leslie, I'm sorry."
Chris Traeger,Ann didn't just go to Ann arbor to visit family.
Chris Traeger,She went to sign the lease on our new home.
Leslie Knope,Ann arbor sounds disgusting.
Chris Traeger,She already has family there.
Chris Traeger,And I have a new job lined up at the University of Michigan.
Chris Traeger,Go blue!
Chris Traeger,It's a good town.
Chris Traeger,And it's a great place to raise a family.
Leslie Knope,What is great about it?
Leslie Knope,There's no JJ's Diner there.
Leslie Knope,"There's no ""Welcome to Pawnee"" sign."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the stupid state is split up into two pieces!"
Leslie Knope,It's ridiculous.
Jeremy Jamm,"Unexpected play here, Superman."
Jeremy Jamm,"Not exactly sure what you're going for, but I dig your Gambit."
Leslie Knope,"There is no Gambit here, Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"And who sides with Lex Luthor, by the way?"
Leslie Knope,You probably watch Million Dollar Baby and root for the stool.
Jeremy Jamm,I haven't seen it.
Jeremy Jamm,Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.
Jeremy Jamm,I find his voice very grating.
Leslie Knope,I am leaving now.
Leslie Knope,I am not moving.
Leslie Knope,I'm just going home.
Jeremy Jamm,Are you guys coming back to my place?
Jeremy Jamm,What's what's or are you guys going back to... we wrapping up the weekend?
Jeremy Jamm,No?
Ben Wyatt,Need a cup to perk me up  coffee in the morning 
All,Surprise!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"
Barney,I hope you don't mind.
Barney,We decided to throw you a pizza party to say congrats for cracking the case.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, you guys."
Ben Wyatt,See what we got here.
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,That's not pizza.
Ben Wyatt,Those are calzones!
Ben Wyatt,I love calzones!
Barney,We know!
Ben Wyatt,I think it's safe to say I made the right choice.
Ben Wyatt,"What's up, guys?"
All,Hey!
Chris Traeger,BFF slideshow?
Chris Traeger,"You know that even after we leave Pawnee, Ann will always be your best friend."
Chris Traeger,And it's not that long a trip.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it would be even faster if the governor would return my calls about my Pawnee to Ann arbor bullet train idea."
Chris Traeger,"You know, I went to Jamm's with you because I also want to leave the right kind of legacy, and that includes Pawnee commons."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think I burned that bridge with Jamm."
Leslie Knope, We're not gonna get that lockbox.
Leslie Knope, And I am not singing Beauty School Dropout.
Leslie Knope," It's sexist, and I don't do slow jams."
Chris Traeger, I have an idea.
Chris Traeger, And I'd like you to consider it a good-bye gift from me to you.
Donna Meagle," No, thank you."
Donna Meagle, I will let him know.
Donna Meagle, That was that couple you liked at the open house.
Ron Swanson, I despised them.
Donna Meagle," Well, they just came back with a new offer and jacked that shizz up."
Donna Meagle, Way over asking price.
Tom Haverford," Ron, who cares who they are? That's a massive bid."
Tom Haverford, I'ma be a mogul.
Ron Swanson, I bought that cabin 18 years go for 2000 dollars. I do not care about the money.
Tom Haverford, I can't even understand what you're saying right now.
Ron Swanson," That cabin served an important purpose for me, as a quiet refuge from the nonsense of modern life."
Ron Swanson, I'd like the next owners to understand and share that purpose.
Ron Swanson," Find me someone like that, and I'll happily sell."
April Ludgate, I'll buy it.
Tom Haverford, You can't afford that house.
Tom Haverford, Can you afford that house?
Ron Swanson,What would you use it for?
April Ludgate,I'd go up there and take Andy and Champion and just get away from everyone else and look at spiders.
April Ludgate, And it's where I'd bury the bodies of that annoying couple after I murder them.
April Ludgate, Here's my offer.
April Ludgate, I will give you everything in my purse.
April Ludgate," 8 dollars, a bunch of loose cough drops, and Larry's asthma inhaler."
Jerry Gergich, Thank God.
Jerry Gergich, I've been looking for that.
April Ludgate," Larry, this is part of a real estate transaction now."
April Ludgate, You have no legal claim to it.
Jerry Gergich," Sorry, I had no idea."
Ron Swanson, This is the best offer I've heard yet.
Donna Meagle," Uh, you tripping right now."
Ron Swanson, Sold.
Donna Meagle, Don't even trip.
Ron Swanson, Your commission.
Donna Meagle, Thanks a lot.
Donna Meagle," Your share, mogul."
Jeremy Jamm," I'm about to play golf with a guy who was almost on The Apprentice, so this better be good."
Chris Traeger," You give Leslie her lockbox, and you get me in your hip pocket."
Chris Traeger," Starting in my next term as city manager, I will give you one huge I.O.U., no questions asked."
Jeremy Jamm, Hmm.
Jeremy Jamm, Jamm likes the sound of that.
Jeremy Jamm," Let's make it five I.O.U.s, and you got a deal."
Chris Traeger," You drive a hard bargain, but you leave me no choice."
Chris Traeger, Fine.
Chris Traeger, Five huge IOUs.
Jeremy Jamm," Deal, guys."
Jeremy Jamm, You must really want that park.
Leslie Knope, I do.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Leslie Knope," And to tell you the truth, I'm doing it all for my best friend."
Jeremy Jamm, That's all I wanted to hear.
Jeremy Jamm," Leslie, you're my best friend too."
Leslie Knope," Well, vote passed."
Leslie Knope, 3-2.
Leslie Knope, Jamm is gonna be so pissed when he finds out that you're leaving and your I.O.U.s are worthless.
Leslie Knope, Are you sure you're okay with what you did?
Chris Traeger,"Well, it's not the most ethical thing that I've ever done, but on the flip side, Jamm is a big, mean dope."
Leslie Knope,Mm-hmm.
Chris Traeger,And I hope that this eases some of the pain of us moving away a little bit.
Leslie Knope," Oh, I'm currently in deep denial that that's happening."
Chris Traeger," Speaking of which, how's the new gig coming?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I got a raise, and my fridge is full of calzones, so not complaining."
Chris Traeger, The reason I ask is this town is gonna need a new city manager.
Chris Traeger," And I've talked to some people, and you have the votes if you want the job."
Ben Wyatt, Wh-- Seriously?
Leslie Knope,Is this for realskis?
Chris Traeger,This is 100% certified for realskis.
Chris Traeger, - What do you say? 
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I-- wow."
Ben Wyatt, I would be insane to say no.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, no."
Barney," Wyatt, you're late."
Barney," I'm just kidding, you can do whatever you want."
Ben Wyatt," Actually, Barney, I'm afraid I have some bad news."
Ben Wyatt, Today's my last day.
Ben Wyatt," I got an opportunity I couldn't say no to, and I have to quit."
Ben Wyatt, Again.
Barney, No need to explain.
Barney, I knew it was too good to be true.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, I do have a little going-away gift."
Ben Wyatt, Left it in the break room.
Ben Wyatt," If anyone could appreciate it, it's you guys."
Barney," ""You can play with one warrior, but it's just not nearly as good."""
Barney, Enjoy.
Barney, Ben Wyatt.
Barney,Let's play.

April Ludgate,"Andy got back from London two days ago, and he still has jet lag."
April Ludgate,It's really annoying.
April Ludgate,We're on totally different schedules.
April Ludgate,Last night he mowed the lawn at 2:00 in the morning.
April Ludgate,Andy!
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,Get me a beer?
April Ludgate,All right.
April Ludgate,"As soon as I wake up he goes down, hard."
April Ludgate,This has to stop.
April Ludgate,"Babe, wake up."
Andy Dwyer,"That's my spaghetti, Chewbacca."
April Ludgate,Babe!
April Ludgate,"You hungry, Champion?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, are you kidding me?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, I fell asleep again?"
April Ludgate,"Andy, you have got to stay up and get on a regular schedule!"
Andy Dwyer,Were you about to spray me with the hose inside the house?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I kind of want you to do it now.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,No no no no no no.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just a reminder, guys, today is Leslie's last day as a city councilor,  so everyone be extra supportive."
Ron Swanson,Already done.
Ron Swanson,"When she walked past me this morning, I gave her a kind nod."
Ben Wyatt,Heartwarming.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I want to get her a present  to cheer her up on her last day."
Ben Wyatt,Any ideas?
Donna Meagle,"A ""Sorry You Lost Your Dream Job"" gift?"
Donna Meagle,"Um, that's a tough one."
Donna Meagle,Stay away from wine.
Donna Meagle,Wine is crying juice.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I mean, you know her better than anybody."
Jerry Gergich,What does she really want more than anything in the world?
Ben Wyatt,A nice candle!
Ben Wyatt,I'm screwed.
Jerry Gergich,"Andy, no!"
April Ludgate,No!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,I'll be right out.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is the Pawnee City Council Chambers."
Leslie Knope,Your new home away from home.
Ingrid de Forest,"Well, technically, my home away from home is in Zurich."
Ingrid de Forest,But this is nice too.
Leslie Knope,Today is my last day as City-- Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Let me try this again.
Leslie Knope,"Today is my last day as… Today is my last--  Today is my last day... You know what, you get the idea."
Leslie Knope,"My old friend Ingrid De Forest won the recall vote,  and she's taking my place on Monday morning."
Leslie Knope,"But you know, luckily for me, I've processed all my feelings, and I've gone through the five stages of grief: denial, anger, Internet commenting, cat adoption, African dance,  cat returning to the adoption place,  watching all the episodes of Murphy Brown and not giving a flying fart."
Leslie Knope,How many stages is that?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,The point is I'm fine now.
Ingrid de Forest,This must be hard for you.
Ingrid de Forest,"It's like what Sir Ian McKellen said to me  the day I sold my boat to Karl Lagerfeld,  ""Parting is such sweet sorrow."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,What is your life?
Ingrid de Forest,"If it makes any difference, your work here was a real inspiration to me,  and I am going to do my best to continue your legacy."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I appreciate the sentiment."
Ingrid de Forest,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,Was I singing Goodbye Yellow Brick Road out loud?
Ingrid de Forest,No.
Ingrid de Forest,"But, would you like to?"
Ingrid de Forest,I studied opera at the Sorbonne.
Ingrid de Forest,I'd be happy to harmonize.
Ingrid de Forest,Goodbye Goodbye  Nah.
Leslie Knope,No.
Trevor Nelson,"And finally,  here is a check for the entirety  of the purchase of Rent A Swag."
Trevor Nelson,"And here is a personal note from my client, Dr. Saperstein."
Tom Haverford,"""Dear Tom, I win."""
Tom Haverford,"""You suck."""
Tom Haverford,"""Turn note over."""
Tom Haverford,"""You still suck."""
Tom Haverford,"""Turn note over."""
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Saperstein couldn't even face me himself?"
Tom Haverford,He had to send in his lackey.
Trevor Nelson,My client isn't at this meeting because he doesn't have to be.
Trevor Nelson,"Successful people, Mr. Haverford,  use their money to get others to work for them."
Tom Haverford,"Mmm, that's an interesting idea, lawyer dude."
Tom Haverford,What if I give you five bucks to put a bag of poop in Saperstein's car?
Trevor Nelson,No.
Tom Haverford,"Ballpark me, how much would it cost?"
Trevor Nelson,10000 dollars.
Tom Haverford,"Counteroffer, why don't you just do it for the story?"
Trevor Nelson,"Goodbye, Mr. Haverford."
Dr. Saperstein,Is it done?
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, how many times did he turn the paper over?"
Dr. Saperstein,"Oh, that is disappointing."
Dr. Saperstein,"So, look at this baby."
Dr. Saperstein,That is the most symmetrical fetus I've ever seen.
Dr. Saperstein,This could be a superhero.
Chris Traeger,Dr. Saperstein.
Dr. Saperstein,Yes.
Chris Traeger,"I know that we should hate you  because you destroyed our friend's business, but we love you so much."
Ann Perkins,We love you.
Dr. Saperstein,I'm lovable.
Dr. Saperstein,"So, do you want to know the sex?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God Should we?"
Ann Perkins,"No, right?"
Ann Perkins,Or maybe yes?
Chris Traeger,Is there an option other than yes or no?
Dr. Saperstein,I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Dr. Saperstein,I'm gonna write it down.
Dr. Saperstein,"Then I'm going to put it in an envelope, seal it,  and when you're ready, voila."
Ann Perkins,That'll be fun.
Chris Traeger,It's like the Oscars.
Ann Perkins,Let's get some food.
Ann Perkins,I'm starving.
Ann Perkins,"Wait, no, I have to pee."
Ann Perkins,"Wait, no, I have to barf!"
Ann Perkins,"Actually, all three."
Ann Perkins,Being pregnant is great.
Tom Haverford,"And finally, Larry's share of the profit."
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,Good to be Larry.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's not, you boring grandpa."
Tom Haverford,"Meanwhile, Tommy's riding high, 32,000 dollars."
Tom Haverford,I'm basically a millionaire.
April Ludgate,"What are you going to do with the money, Tom?"
Tom Haverford,Glad you asked.
Tom Haverford,A horrible man recently gave me some great advice.
Tom Haverford,"For years, I've been coming up with my own ideas  like some sort of non-rich idiot."
Tom Haverford,Now I'm going to let people come to me  and invest my scrilla in the best idea I hear.
Ron Swanson,That sounds like an efficient use of the free market.
Ron Swanson,"I would wish you the best of luck,  but I believe luck is a concept  invented by the weak to explain their failures."
Tom Haverford,"Come hear the ideas with me, Ron."
Tom Haverford,"I could use your wise, grandfatherly advice."
Donna Meagle,Do you think everyone here is a grandfather?
Tom Haverford,"Basically, if you're older than me, you're a grandpa."
Tom Haverford,"And if you are a grandpa, you're dead."
April Ludgate,That sounds right.
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, oops!"
Jerry Gergich,"This check is made out to ""Lenny,""  which I think is a typo for ""Larry,""  which isn't even actually my name."
April Ludgate,"Well, tell it to the bank, Lenny."
Jerry Gergich,Am I Am I Lenny now?
Ben Wyatt,I'd like to order a singing telegram.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, my wife lost her job, so maybe something sad and slow?"
Ben Wyatt,Do you know anything from the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack?
Ben Wyatt,This is a bad idea.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm hanging up now, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Ingrid is settled into my office,  and this box contains the last of my stuff."
Leslie Knope,Although I might have left some salt packets in my desk.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I should go back for those?
Ben Wyatt,"Honey, it's okay."
Ben Wyatt,There'll be other salt packets.
Leslie Knope,But not the kind that snaps in half maybe.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know I'm a broken record,  but getting away from the City Council  is absolutely the best thing for you."
Ben Wyatt,Trust me.
Perd Hapley,"This is Perd Hapley, talking to you now about what's going on, today."
Perd Hapley,"We're live at City Hall, where City Councilman Dexhart  is addressing his latest sex scandal."
Councilman Dexhart,"Recently, certain allegations have come to light  about my inappropriate conduct."
Councilman Dexhart,I am here to set the record straight.
Councilman Dexhart,I totally did all of it.
Ben Wyatt,Another sex scandal?
Ben Wyatt,This guy is unbelievable.
Leslie Knope,How does he find the time?
Councilman Dexhart,"I also engaged in inappropriate texting,  ""sexting,"" and ""Tex-Mexting,""  which is where you send photos of your junk  from the restroom of a Chili's To Go."
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,Ew.
Councilman Dexhart,"Does this make me a ""bad boy""?"
Councilman Dexhart,You tell me.
Councilman Dexhart,"No, really, tell me."
Councilman Dexhart,It gets me off when women tell me that.
Leslie Knope,He's reading this.
Leslie Knope,He wrote this down.
Councilman Dexhart,"I sent these texts to roughly 100 women, under the following pseudonyms"" ""Enrique Shockwave,"" ""Willie Dynamite,"" ""Lee Harvey Teabag."""
Ben Wyatt,"Well, at least you won't have to deal with that guy anymore."
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,Not after someone beats him in the next election.
Leslie Knope,Someone who is smart and hardworking  and who knows the job because she's done it already  and is also blonde and named Leslie and loves you!
Ben Wyatt,Is it you?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to run again.
Leslie Knope,I'm going to beat Dexhart!
Councilman Dexhart,"and ""Anthony Weiner."""
Ben Wyatt,Another City Council campaign?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, think about what you're saying."
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,I challenge you to find one flaw in my plan.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, for one, we don't even live in Dexhart's district."
Leslie Knope,"Not yet, but we can go and rent a second apartment,  and we can spend 51% of our time there, and then I'll file the campaign form from that address."
Ben Wyatt,"I don't want to spend 51% of our time in his district, it's basically a dumping ground for old shipping containers."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,It's like a raccoon shanty town.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's not that bad."
Ben Wyatt,"And also, Dexhart fights dirty."
Ben Wyatt,"He's never lost an election because he runs brutal, scorched earth campaigns."
Leslie Knope,So what?
Leslie Knope,"I've got plenty of dirt  on that scumbag, I say bring it on."
Leslie Knope,"So, I'm going to start my negative PR blitz against Dexhart and"
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I just think we need to take a deep breath,  think about if this is really worth it."
Leslie Knope,Anything is worth me getting back on City Council.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, let's see which one of these lucky visionaries is gonna make me rich."
Tom Haverford,Greg Phillips?
Extra,"Hi, guys."
Extra,Thanks for meeting with me.
April Ludgate,Enough chitchat.
April Ludgate,"What's your pitch, kid?"
April Ludgate,"Come on, time is money, money is power,  power is pizza, pizza is knowledge, let's go."
Extra,"Okay, so, my idea is for an abacus, but on your phone."
Extra,"I call it a ""phone-bacus."""
Ron Swanson,"Son, you just described a calculator."
Extra,"But you're talking about it, right?"
Extra,"Three words, Automated Word Counter."
Tom Haverford,Get out.
Extra,Two words.
Tom Haverford,No.
Extra,One word.
Jerry Gergich,"As you may know, I do like to tinker with things in my garage."
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna hit the can while he's up.
Jerry Gergich,"So, I think I have discovered a way  to generate clean, renewable energy."
Jerry Gergich,I think it's going to
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Tom Haverford,Gross!
April Ludgate,"God, Larry, you sneezed all over us!"
Tom Haverford,I'm not going to buy that thing.
Tom Haverford,It's covered in a gallon of your boogers!
Jerry Gergich,I totally understand.
Jerry Gergich,"Ah, jeez!"
Chris Traeger,I would be thrilled if we have a girl.
Ann Perkins,"Aw, tiny dresses, braids, glitter on everything?"
Ann Perkins,Forget it.
Chris Traeger,And also girls' names are so cute.
Chris Traeger,"Daisy, Annabelle, Lilly"
Ann Perkins,"Olive, Rosemary, Chicken."
Ann Perkins,Fifty burritos.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, I'm starving."
Ann Perkins,"Miss, hi, I'm pregnant, and I'm a little bit crazy,  so if you don't bring our appetizers out in the next 30 seconds,  I'm going to plunge your face into the deep fryer."
Chris Traeger,"And also two waters, please, but no hurry."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Leslie, I don't know if there's a story in these emails."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"They're iffy, but Dexhart has been elected eight times."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I don't think the voters care.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,His poll numbers are actually up since the scandal broke.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's just because people  found out he was Miley Cyrus' cousin."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,He is?
Councilman Dexhart,"Morning, Leslie."
Councilman Dexhart,Sweet Jugs.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,What?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,He's kinda cute.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, Shauna, no."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I just feel like I could fix him, you know?"
Tom Haverford,This sucks!
Tom Haverford,We heard 100 pitches and they're all terrible.
Tom Haverford,Change of plans.
Tom Haverford,You guys are my idea factory.
Tom Haverford,"April, go!"
April Ludgate,"Okay, I got one."
April Ludgate,"""Macaroni and Poison,""  it's like mac and cheese, but with a special ingredient."
Tom Haverford,Ron?
Ron Swanson,Every socket set I've ever bought  only goes up to half inch.
Ron Swanson,"I'd love a couple larger sizes, take it all the way up to five eighths."
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,Bears bouncing on trampoline roads.
Andy Dwyer,There's a chance that I might have dreamed that.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, time to head back to the office."
Ron Swanson,"I've missed an entire day of work,  so at least some good came from this."
Ben Wyatt,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,"Well, they couldn't make a banner in time for my press conference,  so I am cobbling together a banner  from all the other discarded banners."
Ben Wyatt,"""Second chunce four Lesle"""
Ben Wyatt,Perv Dexxxhrt equals birthday mouse?
Leslie Knope,Rat.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's the closest thing I could get to a rat."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, listen to yourself,  loopholes, scorched earth policies. This isn't you."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you aren't supporting me on this.
Leslie Knope,Dexhart has a sex scandal the same day I'm leaving office?
Leslie Knope,"That is not a coincidence, this was meant to be."
Ben Wyatt,You know what?
Ben Wyatt,"Why don't we gather everyone in here,  you explain to them what you're thinking, and we get some feedback."
Leslie Knope,Now you're talking!
Chris Traeger,I would be thrilled if we had a boy.
Chris Traeger,"I have perfected the art of shaving the human face,  and I would love to be able to pass that on."
Ann Perkins,"Toy trucks, superhero costumes, tiny little acorn penis? Forget it."
Chris Traeger,"A weird image, but one that does not diminish my enthusiasm."
Chris Traeger,"Well, Ann Perkins, are you ready to find out the sex of our baby?"
Ann Perkins,I'm ready.
Chris Traeger,"We are having a  ""Distributions."""
Chris Traeger,"That's what it looks like, ""Distributions."""
Ann Perkins,Let me see that.
Ann Perkins,"It says ""Congratulations."""
Ann Perkins,I think.
Ann Perkins,"Then it says, ""I leg Smurf."""
Ann Perkins,Are we having a Smurf?
Chris Traeger,"We are having an ""eleven jewel toilet."""
Ann Perkins, I can't tell what's words and what's punctuation.
Ann Perkins,The suspense is killing me!
Chris Traeger,I'm calling Dr. Saperstein.
Ann Perkins,I'm calling Domino's.
Ann Perkins,Do you think Domino's delivers to this restaurant?
Ann Perkins,I hope so.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no."
Chris Traeger,He's out for the rest of the day.
Chris Traeger,I have literally never been more stressed out.
Leslie Knope,"Good, you guys are here."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody, gather around."
Leslie Knope,I have a big announcement.
Leslie Knope,I am officially seeking reelection to the Pawnee City Council.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to be running for Dexhart's seat, and the campaign starts now!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I love the sound of silence before a big cheer."
Leslie Knope,"That's what's happening, right?"
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, no offense,  I've heard a lot of bad ideas today, this is the worst."
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,I would love it  if you ran an insane campaign and basically turned into the Joker.
April Ludgate,But that means you probably shouldn't do it.
Leslie Knope,Andy?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,"It seems risky,  and I'd hate to see you go through another tough fight."
Andy Dwyer,"But I could be wrong, I haven't pooped in three days."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, you have always given me sage counsel,  and your words carry great influence."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you think I should do?"
Ron Swanson,I do not think you should run again.
Leslie Knope,"What the hell do you know, dumdum?"
Leslie Knope,"All of you, look, this is my only option."
Leslie Knope,I am running again with or without you.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, you're running for office again?"
Jerry Gergich,What a great idea!
Jerry Gergich,How can I help?
Tom Haverford,"Well, no one else brought me any good business ideas, so I decided to take care of it myself."
Tom Haverford,Talking Tissue!
Tom Haverford,"Every time you pull one out, you get a little message to hype you up."
Tom Haverford,"Blow that nose, playa!"
April Ludgate,No.
Tom Haverford,This stinks!
Tom Haverford,I'm just gonna have to go back to my same job that I've had forever.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I get why you're bummed out."
April Ludgate,"I mean, look at me,  I'm younger than you, and I already have my own department."
April Ludgate,"Plus I'm married, and I make more money than you."
Tom Haverford,Whatever.
Tom Haverford,You just merged your department with Parks  and then made up your own title.
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,It's awesome.
Tom Haverford,"I'm empty, yo!"
Tom Haverford,Fill me up!
Andy Dwyer,Do that again.
Dr. Saperstein,What could you possibly need at 6:00 in the morning?
Ann Perkins,"We couldn't read your writing, and we need to know the sex of our baby."
Dr. Saperstein,I'm watching cartoons with my son.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Daddy, an Elmer Fudd one is on."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Stop it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"What's up, beautiful?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I live in the guesthouse.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What do you say you and I get together in a special way?
Ann Perkins,I'm pregnant.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The more the merrier.
Chris Traeger,With my baby.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"You can come too, beautiful."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Look at that, I guess sometimes I call men ""beautiful"" too."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I guess I'm open-minded as hell!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I think you're pretty goodlooking 
Chris Traeger,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,"Can you just read that and tell us what the sex is, please?"
Dr. Saperstein,Wow.
Dr. Saperstein,It looks like the chicken that wrote this had a stroke on the paper.
Dr. Saperstein,"Listen, I kind of remember, but I don't want to say anything that's wrong."
Dr. Saperstein,Give me 15 minutes.
Dr. Saperstein,"I will get dressed, we'll go down to my office."
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Have a good day at work today, Daddy."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Also, if you don't know already,  there's a malfunction with the TV  where it keeps ordering porno"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Like a ton of porno,  like how can someone watch that much porno in one sitting,  only when you're out of the house,  so if you see it on the bill that's why."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"""And therefore, with your help, we can make our future bright."
Leslie Knope,"""I believe I still have a lot to offer this city."""
Ben Wyatt,I'd swap those two lines.
Ben Wyatt,Always helps to end on the call to action.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry if it felt like everyone piled on.
Ben Wyatt,"We were just being honest,  but if you really want to do this, of course we'll support you."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I stormed out.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I've been thinking for weeks  of what to get you as a ""last day in City Council"" present."
Ben Wyatt,I finally figured it out.
Ben Wyatt,"  You remember Jen Barkley, political consultant and power broker."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Leslie Knope, What brings you back to Pawnee?
Jennifer Barkley,Ben bought one hour of my time.
Jennifer Barkley,"  I heard you need some consulting."
Leslie Knope,"  Well, uh, I guess."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, how are you? How's your family?"
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, I get paid $1,200 an hour."
Jennifer Barkley,Do you really want to spend any of that time talking about my mother and her 19-year-old Korean husband?
Leslie Knope,"Well, that does sound fascinating,"
Leslie Knope, but you're right.
Jennifer Barkley,"  Okay, getting a chair."
Tom Haverford,"  Ron!  That's how I enter rooms now."
Tom Haverford," It's more dramatic."
Ron Swanson,Why did you enter at all?
Tom Haverford, Because I have some huge news.
Tom Haverford,"  You're looking at Pawnee's new Business Liaison."
Ron Swanson,"  I don't like French words."
Ron Swanson,"I do like the word ""business."""
Ron Swanson,You may continue.
Tom Haverford,"April created a new position for herself, and I want to do the same."
Tom Haverford,"The town could use more private sector money after the merger,  so as Business Liaison, I would find companies looking to move or expand,  and convince them to do it in Pawnee."
Ron Swanson,"  Now this is a good idea."
Ron Swanson,"  You've come a long way, son."
Tom Haverford,And while I've got you here
Tom Haverford,Talking Tissue.
Tom Haverford," Go for it."
Tom Haverford,"Yo, dawg, life is what you make of it!  Leave while I'm ahead? You got it!  Clear them sinuses, playboy."
Tom Haverford,"
  Someone's got the ""sniffies."""
Tom Haverford,Tell your mama you love her.
Tom Haverford,"  Step up your vitamin C game, bro."
Leslie Knope, So they recall me after all I've done for them!
Jennifer Barkley,Ridiculous.
Leslie Knope,"  But Dexhart now has another sex scandal."
Jennifer Barkley," Of course he does."
Leslie Knope,"And the plan is I'm going to run for his seat because how do I lose to a guy like that?  That's a great idea, right?"
Jennifer Barkley, It's a terrible idea.
Leslie Knope,  I knew it.
Leslie Knope," Wait, what?"
Jennifer Barkley,"First of all, you could  lose to a guy like that."
Jennifer Barkley,"  I should know, those terrible people have paid me so much money,  I have a condo on every Virgin Island."
Jennifer Barkley,"  Now, you might win."
Jennifer Barkley," You're smart, Ben is smart, you might win."
Jennifer Barkley,  But why would you want to?
Leslie Knope, Because it's my dream job.
Jennifer Barkley,Then dream bigger.
Jennifer Barkley,"Look, you love this town, it's being run by monsters and morons?  Get a better job,  rise above their heads, affect change at a higher level."
Jennifer Barkley,"  Don't be the kid that graduates high school,  hangs out in the school parking lot."
Jennifer Barkley,"  Be the woman who moves away climbs the ladder,  and then confidently comes   and has sex with her hot old English teacher  just for kicks."
Leslie Knope,  Is that what you did?
Jennifer Barkley,"Yeah, Mr. Baker."
Jennifer Barkley," Sex was pretty good, thanks to me."
Jennifer Barkley,"  Look, Pawnee has done you a favor."
Jennifer Barkley,You've outgrown them.
Jennifer Barkley,"  You've got talent, you've got name recognition,  which means that you have a bright, wide-open future  with a thousand options."
Jennifer Barkley,"  State Senate, federal jobs, even Congress,  all of these are doable for you."
Jennifer Barkley,  And you can trust me.
Jennifer Barkley,  Because I don't care enough about you to lie.
Jennifer Barkley,"  Uh-oh, time's up  Okay, if you want to keep talking,  you're going to have to pay me 1,200 more dollars."
Leslie Knope,I just need
Jennifer Barkley,"I swear to God, if you say one more word,  you will legally owe me 1200 dollars,  and I will sue you."
Jennifer Barkley,Let's not end it like that.
Jennifer Barkley,"  Okay, great to see you, Leslie."
Jennifer Barkley,  Those five words are on me.
Jennifer Barkley,  Should I move this back? Don't answer that.
Ben Wyatt,"  I don't know what you're thinking,  but you have a press conference in 10 minutes."
Chris Traeger,"  Well, this is it. The final moment."
Chris Traeger,What are you hoping for?
Ann Perkins,I will honestly be happy either way.
Chris Traeger,"Me, too."
Chris Traeger," Boy or girl, it doesn't matter."
Chris Traeger,  Because it will literally be the greatest child who has ever lived.
Ann Perkins,  You swear you have no preference?
Chris Traeger, You?
Ann Perkins,Not at all.
Dr. Saperstein," Who's ready, raise your hand?  It's a boy!"
Chris Traeger,Yes! Yes!  I thought you didn't have a preference!
Ann Perkins,I didn't.
Ann Perkins, I just really wanted it to be a boy.
Chris Traeger,"  Me, too."
Chris Traeger, I don't know why.
Dr. Saperstein, You guys are just so neat.
Dr. Saperstein," Would you be interested in adopting my children?  They're in their late 20s, They're terrible."
Dr. Saperstein, No? No go?  Huh.
Dr. Saperstein, I ask all my patients.
Leslie Knope," I have gathered you all here today  because I have an announcement,  a very big announcement about my future."
Leslie Knope," I will be heading to lunch today,  with my husband, at JJ's Diner."
Leslie Knope, We will eat waffles and then we will go home and make out on our couch.
Leslie Knope," That is my future, for now."
Leslie Knope," It's been an honor to serve this town,  and I will cherish the memories forever."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Perd Hapley," There you have it, a shockingly un-shocking press conference,  in which a recently-unemployed woman said nothing of importance."
Perd Hapley, I'm Perd Hapley and I just realized I'm not holding my microphone.
Leslie Knope, Jen Barkley telling me I had a future  was the best present I could've gotten.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Ben Wyatt, You're welcome.
Ben Wyatt, But I did get you one other present  to take your mind off of all this.
Leslie Knope,"Aw, you are the sweetest man in the world."
Leslie Knope,Where is it?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it's not here."
Ben Wyatt,We have to go get it.
Leslie Knope,"In times of stress, or moments of transition, sometimes it can feel like the whole world is closing in on you."
Leslie Knope," When that happens, you should close your eyes, take a deep breath,  listen to the people who love you when they give you advice,  and remember what really matters."
Leslie Knope," And if you have the ability to go to Paris, by all means, go to Paris."
Ben Wyatt,I found one.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, great."
Leslie Knope,Right here.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Leslie Knope,Mmm-hmm.

Leslie Knope,"Hello, I am Leslie Knope, and I am here to interview for the Deputy Parks Director job."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is ridiculous."
Ron Swanson,It's your job.
Ron Swanson,Take it.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I should have to interview  just like everyone else."
Ron Swanson,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Now, if you'll see on my resume, I held the position of deputy director of parks and recreation for almost ten years."
Ron Swanson,I know.
Ron Swanson,I was your boss.
Ron Swanson,I also walked you down the aisle at your wedding.
Ron Swanson,Take the job and leave me alone.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Just interview me.
Leslie Knope,No special treatment.
Ron Swanson,"Okay, fine."
Ron Swanson,What do you believe should be the ultimate goal of this department?
Leslie Knope,"The ancient Greek version of the park was the agora, a gathering place where people from all walks of life"
Leslie Knope,What are you writing?
Leslie Knope,Is it good?
Ron Swanson,What do you think is the best use of our yearly budget?
Leslie Knope,It's right there in the name: Maintaining our beautiful parks and providing healthy outdoor recreation.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sorry, Ms. Knope, the correct answer is ""Give it all back to the taxpayers."""
Ron Swanson,It seems you and I have fundamentally different philosophies.
Ron Swanson,"Frankly, it's a miracle we ever worked together without killing each other."
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Leslie Knope,"Ha, ha, okay."
Leslie Knope,No more goofing around.
Leslie Knope,Just tell me I have the job.
Ron Swanson,I have a lot of other people to meet with.
Ron Swanson,I'll be in touch.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on, it's me."
Leslie Knope,Give me special treatment.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, first morning meeting back in the old conference room."
Leslie Knope,What's this?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, it shows everyone's spirit dogs."
Tom Haverford,That one's you.
Leslie Knope,You guys think I'm a border collie?
Leslie Knope,So obviously a cocker spaniel.
April Ludgate,The spirit dog committee ruled on that weeks ago.
April Ludgate,There is no appeals process.
Donna Meagle,No.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Leslie Knope,I'm in on the joke.
Leslie Knope,"I get it, but maybe we should stop talking about your insane dog choices and get to working."
Donna Meagle,Classic border collie.
Donna Meagle,Has to control everything.
Leslie Knope,Totally.
Tom Haverford,"First on the agenda: I'm gonna bring my lemonade stand idea to the small business coalition, and a little birdie told me it's already in the bag."
Tom Haverford,Can I get a what what?
Ron Swanson,What?
Leslie Knope,What?
Tom Haverford,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,What idea?
Ron Swanson,"The fella who runs the hot stew stand in Lafayette Park is retiring, so Pawnee's new business liaison-- Tom-- went out and got the Indiana Brothers juice company to rent it out as a lemonade stand."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, I downloaded this dope app that pops champagne whenever I say something awesome."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that's great."
Tom Haverford,I know.
Tom Haverford,And it was only 9 bucks.
Leslie Knope,"No, I mean, the lemonade... never mind."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I will start doing an environmental impact study, and Ron, you can do some demographic research."
Tom Haverford,"Don't sweat it, Lezkno."
Tom Haverford,Tommy's taking care of every last detail.
Leslie Knope,Nothing I can do to help?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,I can straighten this for you.
Leslie Knope,There we go.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, Larry."
Chris Traeger,We've been taking pictures all over City Hall to show our unborn baby where we met.
Chris Traeger,Would you mind?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh."
Jerry Gergich,I would be honored.
Jerry Gergich,"Say, when are you crazy kids gonna get hitched?"
Ann Perkins,"Well, you know, actually, we haven't discussed it in a while."
Chris Traeger,"No, it's kind of taken a back seat."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, you know, to each his own, but you guys really seem like you're in love."
Jerry Gergich,"And when I see a couple who look at each other the way you do, I don't know, it just makes me think that maybe this crazy world is gonna be okay."
Chris Traeger,That literally went on forever.
Chris Traeger,I thought you were never gonna stop talking.
Chris Traeger,"But now that you have, Ann Perkins, will you marry me?"
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Cracker dust.
Ann Perkins,"Uh, I mean, yes, of of course, let's do it."
Jerry Gergich,"Can I have a sip of your water, please?"
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, no."
Chris Traeger,I'mI'm a bit of a germaphobe.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, no, no, totally understand."
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins
Jerry Gergich,I'm gonna cough it out.
Chris Traeger,I would like to spend the rest of my life with you.
Chris Traeger,I love you.
Ann Perkins,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,No part of this is how I pictured it.
Jerry Gergich,"I thought another cracker might push it through, but I was wrong."
Chris Traeger,Let's do this right.
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Chris Traeger,Let's go get an engagement ring.
Ann Perkins,Yes.
Jerry Gergich,That was a beautiful moment.
Ben Wyatt,"Hello, France!"
Andy Dwyer,Mm.
Ben Wyatt,You guys enjoying that cheese?
Ben Wyatt,It's unpasteurized.
Andy Dwyer,What's that mean?
Ben Wyatt,Unpasteurized?
Andy Dwyer,I don't care.
Andy Dwyer,I don't care.
Ben Wyatt,"Technically, it's illegal in this country."
Ben Wyatt,I smuggled it back from Paris.
Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, I want you guys to think of my office as a clubhouse, total open door policy."
Ben Wyatt,I wanna be your friend as well as your boss.
April Ludgate,What the hell is wrong with you?
April Ludgate,Are you in a cult?
April Ludgate,Can I join?
April Ludgate,Let's sacrifice Larry.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, April."
Ben Wyatt,"It's my first day as city manager, so I'm holding open office hours to break the ice."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, Chris was always the nice guy that made everyone happy, while I brought down the hammer."
Ben Wyatt,"But now that he's gone, I kind of have to do both."
Ben Wyatt,Everyone is the best.
Ben Wyatt,We're cutting vacation time.
Ben Wyatt,Let's eat vitamins.
Ben Wyatt,This is exhausting.
Ben Wyatt,Listen real quick.
Ben Wyatt,I have some super cool new rules
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, nice."
Ben Wyatt,That are also super mandatory.
Donna Meagle,"Uh, we can't use Facebook anymore?"
Donna Meagle,Are you serious?
Ben Wyatt,That's right.
Ben Wyatt,Massive time waster.
Ben Wyatt,Kills productivity.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, sanitation."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, let's talk health insurance."
Ben Wyatt,Your dependents don't have it anymore.
Ben Wyatt,Have some illegal cheese.
April Ludgate,No cell phone usage on City Hall property?
April Ludgate,"That's not fair, my cell phone is how I avoid doing work."
Andy Dwyer,Bathroom breaks should be limited to five minutes?
Andy Dwyer,I can't shower in five minutes.
Donna Meagle,"See, he's acting all looseygoosey, but that little dude's wound so tight, he's gonna pop."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, sanitation, sanitation in the house tonight"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, what happened to our spirit dogs?"
Leslie Knope,I came up with a way better game.
Leslie Knope,Behold your spirit kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you are a blue flyer."
Leslie Knope,So am I.
Leslie Knope,So are you and Donna.
Leslie Knope,And look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,Look at Ron.
Leslie Knope,I mean Doesn't Ron look exactly like a blue flyer?
Leslie Knope,There aren't that many different types of kangaroos.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, hell of a game, right, guys?"
Leslie Knope,"Presentations are upon us, so, Tom, which step are you at in The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System?"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, once you got on the city council,  we kinda stopped doin' that."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, no, you cannot drop The Leslie Knope Project Preparedness Super System."
Leslie Knope,It was developed over thousands of government presentations that I gave over the past ten years.
Leslie Knope,It is my very soul.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I have my own system."
Tom Haverford,Step one: Chill out a bit.
Tom Haverford,Step two: Get up there and rip it.
Leslie Knope,That's your plan?
Leslie Knope,To-- to rip it?
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, this is Tom's project."
Ron Swanson,Perhaps you should let him do things his way.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, yeah, you should probably just rip it."
Leslie Knope,"I think that's better than going with a tried and true 80 step system that led to and I quote ""The most thorough and, dare we say, at times, overprepared presentation that we've seen."""
Leslie Knope,"And yeah, that quote came from the Indiana blue ribbon panel on irrigation and drainage."
Tom Haverford,"Fine, I'll go back to your system."
Tom Haverford,You're the big dog around here.
Leslie Knope,Big kangaroo.
Leslie Knope,And thank you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, I was gone for a while and things are a little different around here, but this is still my house."
Leslie Knope,"I invented this parks game, son."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Damn it!
Leslie Knope,When did they put a lamp here?
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,The boys in blue?
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, what can I do for you for?"
Extra,We got a tip about some food entering the country illegally.
Ben Wyatt,"No no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,"This-- it's just cheese, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, I got it in France."
Extra,Okay.
Extra,Did you declare it on your customs form when you reentered the country?
Extra,We're gonna need you to come down to the station.
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure that's not necessary.
Ben Wyatt,Let's just this is really good cheese.
Ben Wyatt,You should try some.
Extra,Are you trying to bribe us?
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,I surrender.
Extra,Step forward.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, okay."
Extra,There you go.
Chris Traeger,This is so exciting.
Theodore,"Hi, folks."
Theodore,When's the big day?
Theodore,"I assume this is a, you know"
Chris Traeger,Oh. No.
Chris Traeger,"This isn't a shotgun wedding, although, yes, she is pregnant, and, yes, we did just decide to get married today."
Ann Perkins,"We haven't told our families or chosen a venue, but it's not a shotgun wedding."
Extra,We've been planning ours for months.
Extra,You wouldn't believe how much there is to do.
Extra,"Invitations, table settings, color scheme, dance lessons."
Extra,And that's just for the rehearsal dinner.
Ann Perkins,Oh.
Extra,"Seriously, that's just for the rehearsal dinner."
Ann Perkins,That sounds elaborate.
Ann Perkins,"All we did was punch ""jewelry store"" into our car GPS."
Ann Perkins,"You remember that romantic moment, Chris?"
Chris Traeger,I was getting gas.
Chris Traeger,"No, I don't remember it."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed."
Leslie Knope,Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, flipped through it."
Tom Haverford,Looks good.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Leslie Knope,You're lying.
Leslie Knope,"I placed a single strand of hair along the edge, and that secret strand is unbroken."
Ron Swanson,Whose hair is that?
Ron Swanson,It's brown.
Leslie Knope,"Look, it seems like you don't even care about your presentation."
Tom Haverford,Au contraire.
Tom Haverford,I'm working on it right now.
Tom Haverford,And what's the most important part of a presentation?
Leslie Knope,Content.
Tom Haverford,The presentation.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you need hard data."
Leslie Knope,You need facts to make your case.
Leslie Knope,And then you need two funny quotes and an inspirational one.
Leslie Knope,"You know, a classic ha ha hmm."
Tom Haverford,"Look, I think you need to take a page out of my system and chill out a bit, okay?"
Tom Haverford,I got this.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine, I trust you."
Leslie Knope,"But I think you're gonna fail, and you're a ticking time bomb."
Tom Haverford,What's that?
Leslie Knope,"Nothing, good luck."
Ron Swanson,This is an elk hair.
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,It's the most effective hair for binder security.
Leslie Knope,"You know that, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"If Tom gives that presentation, it is going to be a total disaster for both him and the department."
Leslie Knope,I cannot sit idly by and watch this terrible thing happen.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I can barely sit idly by and watch good things happen."
Extra,"We've got a couple of customs agents coming down from the border, and they are not happy."
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe this.
Ben Wyatt,I never break the law.
Ben Wyatt,I've never even jaywalked.
Extra,Never?
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, everyone does it sometimes."
Extra,Just add that to the charges.
Extra,"Well, well, well, we got a hit on your prints."
Extra,Seems you're wanted for tax fraud in Colorado?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,I've never even been to Colorado.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I had a layover in Denver once."
Extra,"Man, you can't keep your story straight, can you?"
Ben Wyatt,Come on!
Extra,Oh.
Extra,Here comes the customs guys now.
Extra,"Fellas, he's all yours."
Donna Meagle,You're pranked.
Andy Dwyer,You gotta see the stupid look on your face.
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,I took a picture.
Andy Dwyer,Classic!
Donna Meagle,You seemed a little uptight.
Donna Meagle,Thought we'd have some fun with our new boss.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,This-- you got me.
Ben Wyatt,"Good one, makin' me think I was gonna like die in federal prison"
Ben Wyatt,"Ah, that's super funny, you scamps."
Leslie Knope,"Now, Stu, I know that you're thinking about retiring, and I am here to ask you to reconsider."
Leslie Knope,What do you say?
Leslie Knope,"Keep that Lafayette Park stand open, pumpin' out the stew like you do."
Stu,I don't know.
Stu,"I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife, working on some new hobbies."
Stu,I was thinking about getting into bisques.
Leslie Knope,"Stu, you have been a staple in the parks department system for years."
Leslie Knope,Retirement is for the birds.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna be so bored.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna say this because you need to hear it.
Leslie Knope,Screw bisque.
Stu,That makes a lot of sense.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Stu,What now?
Stu,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're gonna need to convince the business council to keep you around, but that's not for you to worry about."
Leslie Knope,I'll take care of it.
Leslie Knope,You just keep on stewin' what you stew.
Stu,"Thanks, Leslie."
Stu,This calls for a toast.
Stu,Susan?
Stu,"Stew flutes, please."
Stu,Ah.
Leslie Knope,To stew.
Stu,Mm.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,That's very hot.
Stu,Mmhmm.
Theodore,Congratulations.
Theodore,This is a beauty.
Theodore,"If you like, I could engrave the date on the inside of the band."
Ann Perkins,"That may be tough, 'cause we actually haven't discussed it yet."
Chris Traeger,"We could engrave ""2014""  or ""TBD."""
Ann Perkins,Hang on.
Ann Perkins,"If neither of us has ever thought about this stuff, then maybe there's a reason."
Chris Traeger,"When you think about it, we are already more married than most married people."
Ann Perkins,Right?
Ann Perkins,"I mean, we're having a child together."
Ann Perkins,We're moving to a new city.
Ann Perkins,You let me pee with the door open so I could watch the end of Grey's Anatomy.
Chris Traeger,That was a fantastic season finale and a show that is literally a neverending roller coaster of emotion.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, why spend thousands of dollars just to reaffirm what we already know, which is that we love each other?"
Extra,That is so beautiful.
Chris Traeger,"Theodore, we would like to return that ring."
Chris Traeger,"And get a refund, please."
Extra,Maybe we should talk this over too.
Theodore,"Oh, come on."
Extra,Think what we could do if we didn't buy this ring.
Extra,"I mean, this could go towards buying a house."
Chris Traeger,You have a lovely store.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, boss?"
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"I was just printing out my minesweeper high score, and I noticed this memo."
Andy Dwyer,You're punishing us for the prank?
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,It's just like a warning memo.
Ben Wyatt,"Like, ""Hey, all in good fun, but I'm your boss, and if you do it again, you're suspended."""
Ben Wyatt,That kind of thing.
Andy Dwyer,Listen.
Andy Dwyer,"I know that you're the governor or whatever, and I'm just government junior."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Andy Dwyer,I feel like you're blowing it.
Andy Dwyer,"If you want people to like you, you have to play along."
Andy Dwyer,Don't punish Donna and April.
Andy Dwyer,Prank them back.
Ben Wyatt,"I guess I could stand to loosen up a little, but I don't know how to pull a prank."
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, okay."
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I could help you."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I once did the best prank of all time.
Andy Dwyer,I dumped all of my boss's action figures  into a fish tank.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that was me."
Ben Wyatt,And I didn't really like it.
Andy Dwyer,Classic.
Leslie Knope,"Great news, guys."
Leslie Knope,I just saved your bacon.
Ron Swanson,Impossible.
Ron Swanson,You don't even know where it is.
Leslie Knope,"I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement."
Leslie Knope,So pressure's off.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,I spent a lot of time on this.
Leslie Knope,"Doin' what, putting mousse in your hair?"
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based serum.
Tom Haverford,"Second of all, who uses mousse still?"
Tom Haverford,"Oh, God."
Tom Haverford,Leslie.
Tom Haverford,Let's put our differences aside for a second.
Tom Haverford,"Friend to friend, do you still use mousse?"
Leslie Knope,"No, I use the juicy space thing-- whatever you do."
Leslie Knope,"The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Stu's sales are flat.
Tom Haverford,Lemonade's the future.
Tom Haverford,I'm still doing my presentation.
Leslie Knope,"I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes."
Tom Haverford,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Ron Swanson,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,I didn't think so.
Chris Traeger,"On the other hand, there are some benefits to being married: Taxes, health insurance, and I don't have to feel weird when hotel employees call me ""Mr. Perkins."""
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that makes me feel weird too."
Ann Perkins,Maybe we should.
Ann Perkins,"I don't know anymore."""
Chris Traeger,"""Maybe we should."""
Chris Traeger,"""I don't know anymore."""
Chris Traeger,"Ann, that is a beautiful sentiment."
Theodore,"Okay, you're all set."
Theodore,Credit card's been fully refunded.
Chris Traeger,Perfect timing.
Chris Traeger,We are going to buy this ring.
Chris Traeger,Charge it.
Chris Traeger,"Ann Perkins, will you marry me?"
Ann Perkins,I don't know!
Chris Traeger,Me either!
Chris Traeger,Maybe let's not?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, I think maybe not."
Theodore,Okay.
Theodore,Ring's yours again.
Theodore,Hello?
Chris Traeger,"Actually, we don't want the ring."
Theodore,Unbelievable.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, look."
Ron Swanson,"I'm the last person to want to deprive the world of more stew, but are you sure you wanna do this?"
Leslie Knope,"Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up."
Leslie Knope,Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?
Leslie Knope,The botched laser show?
Leslie Knope,Larry still can't see purple.
Ron Swanson,That was Larry's fault.
Ron Swanson,He picked up the laser and stared right into it.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but still, Tom is all flash and no substance."
Ron Swanson,That's the old Tom.
Ron Swanson,"You've been gone for a while, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Tom has changed.
Ron Swanson,"He ran a business, sold it for a profit."
Ron Swanson,"He's also been working here for six years, and he's learned a lot from you."
Ron Swanson,"At some point, you're gonna have to trust him to do his job."
Andy Dwyer,You guys.
Andy Dwyer,You guys.
Andy Dwyer,Be cool.
April Ludgate,What's going on?
Andy Dwyer,"I kind of convinced Ben to prank you guys, and it got a little out of hand."
Andy Dwyer,"I probably should've said no to some of his ideas, but he's on his way here right now."
Andy Dwyer,Here he is.
Andy Dwyer,Just be cool.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt,What's up?
Ben Wyatt,"Um, oh, I just remembered."
Ben Wyatt,Can I show you something out to the front area?
Ben Wyatt,And leave your cell phones because of no reason.
Ben Wyatt,"Just leave anything that can't get wet, actually, like you would normally."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here we go to the parking lot now."
April Ludgate,"Wow, this is really sad."
Ben Wyatt,"Yep, follow to me, guys."
Ben Wyatt,Just going to the parking lot for normal government reasons.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, can't go through with this."
Ben Wyatt,I was gonna pull a prank.
April Ludgate,No!
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"I hired these guys in ski masks to kidnap us, and I was gonna pretend to be a hero."
Ben Wyatt,"They were gonna shoot me and drive the van into the river, and that's when the divers would go in, pull you guys out of the water, and I would be standing on the shore like, ""Hey, you get pranked much?"""
Donna Meagle,What the [bleep]?
Ben Wyatt,"I even got these squibs from a special effects guy, and I was gonna say this code word."
Andy Dwyer,And that's when I would push this button.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, no!"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,You got blood all over me.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,I mean it.
April Ludgate,"Ben, that was amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
April Ludgate,Best prank ever.
Theodore,"I'm sorry, buddy, daddy can't get home to tuck you in."
Chris Traeger," Oh, how old is your son?"
Theodore,Just pick a thing.
Ann Perkins," Honey, look at this."
Ann Perkins, This is what I want.
Ann Perkins, I don't want a ring.
Ann Perkins, I don't want a wedding.
Ann Perkins, I just want this locket with a picture of our child in it.
Ann Perkins," I mean, we've never been traditional."
Ann Perkins, We made out the first night we ever met.
Chris Traeger," And when we did date, we broke up, but you didn't realize it, and that was very embarrassing for you."
Ann Perkins," Yeah, let's maybe not talk about that part right now."
Chris Traeger," And then we got pregnant as friends, and then we fell in love."
Chris Traeger," We've never been very conventional, so why start now?"
Chris Traeger,"Theodore? We will not be needing that ring, but we would like to purchase this locket."
Chris Traeger, How much?
Theodore,Just take it and get outta here.
Chris Traeger,Thank you!
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Extra, We're here to discuss a business contract for the Lafayette Park food stand.
Extra," Miss Knope, you've always steered this committee in the right direction."
Extra, Why do you think we should renew Hot Stu's lease?
Leslie Knope,"Well, frankly, it's because of Stu."
Leslie Knope," Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel."
Leslie Knope," And then he realized, ""No, I wanna spend my time in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat."""
Leslie Knope,"Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle."
Leslie Knope," Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that."
Leslie Knope, Maybe a year extension isn't enough.
Leslie Knope, Maybe we should make it five years.
Leslie Knope," Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal?"
Leslie Knope,I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.
Stu, I think I've made a terrible mistake.
Extra," Okay, that was bleak."
Extra," Uh. Mr. Haverford, you have a presentation as well?"
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope, Rip it.
Tom Haverford, There's nothing more American than lemonade.
Tom Haverford, Just sayin' the word makes you wanna drink some.
Tom Haverford, And now you can.
Tom Haverford, Check under your seats.
Extra," Heh, hey."
Extra, Has my name on it.
Tom Haverford," Yes, it does."
Tom Haverford," Classic for you, Carter."
Tom Haverford," Darva, yours is a pink lemonade."
Tom Haverford,I know you love that.
Extra,Because I like pink.
Tom Haverford, That's right.
Tom Haverford," Now, who here likes laser shows?"
Tom Haverford,Summer foot traffic in Lafayette Park has increased 23%.
Tom Haverford, The Indiana Brothers are the fastest-growing beverage company in the Midwest.
Tom Haverford, My projections show they can increase government revenue 30% over the next five years.
Tom Haverford," Plus, they've agreed to waive their franchise fee."
Ben Wyatt," Look, guys, I'm sorry about all the new rules, But-- you know, I want you to like me."
Ben Wyatt, But I- I also really need you to respect me.
Andy Dwyer," I respect you, little buddy."
Andy Dwyer, Come here.
Andy Dwyer," Mm, respect noogie."
Ben Wyatt, Ah!
Donna Meagle,We didn't prank you 'cause we don't respect you.
Donna Meagle, We did it 'cause we love you.
Andy Dwyer,  R e s p e g c
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's actually not how respect is spelled."
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,"According to Urethra Franklin, that's exactly how it's spelled."
Extra," Hey, Wyatt."
Extra, You were a good sport earlier.
Extra, No hard feelings?
Tom Haverford,Here's a little gift for you for believing in me.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Tom Haverford,It's a gel-based hair serum.
Tom Haverford," Enough with the mousse, for real."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," Well, Ron, you were right."
Leslie Knope, Tom has really grown up.
Ron Swanson, You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.
Ron Swanson,Why?
Leslie Knope,"Well, Tom's come into his own."
Leslie Knope, April runs Animal Control.
Leslie Knope," I mean, does this department even need me anymore?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson, We do not.
Ron Swanson, April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met.
Ron Swanson, It's why I hired them.
Ron Swanson, Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees.
Ron Swanson, This office can indeed function without you.
Ron Swanson," And soon, it'll have to."
Leslie Knope, Was that a death threat?
Ron Swanson,We both know you're not gonna be here forever.
Ron Swanson, This is a weigh station on the road to bigger and better things.
Ron Swanson," Whenever you do move on, it should please you to know that-- God help me-- you've built a well-functioning government agency."
Leslie Knope," Oh, that reminds me."
Leslie Knope," I know you don't open your mail, but I do."
Leslie Knope," And because you created Tom's position-- business liaison-- and it's already financially paying off, you have received Pawnee's government employee of the month."
Leslie Knope," I mean, it has taken--   "

Ben Wyatt,"I've got to say that this report is quite impressive, Miss Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you very much, Mr. City Manager."
Leslie Knope,And I have to say that the way that you're rockin' those slacks is quite impressive as well.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."
Ron Swanson,"Can we hurry this up, please?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the fantastic work of one of your employees, especially if she's adorable."
Leslie Knope,"I am back at the parks department, and Ben is city manager, but we're married, so it's kosher."
Leslie Knope,And awesome.
Leslie Knope,We live together 
Ben Wyatt,And work together.
Leslie Knope,And we are so In sync
Ben Wyatt,That we finish each other's
Leslie Knope,Sentences!
Leslie Knope,We rehearsed that at home.
Leslie Knope,Naked in bed.
Ben Wyatt,What!
Leslie Knope,What!
Ron Swanson,Please stamp the form.
Ben Wyatt,I just want to admire it one more time.
Ben Wyatt,"Again, fantastic work."
Ben Wyatt,"In fact, such good work I think I'm in love with you."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, that's great news, 'cause I'm in love with you too."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,Stamp the form.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, let's not let Ron feel left out."
Leslie Knope,"We love you too, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Stamp the damn form.
Leslie Knope,Group hug!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm down for a group hug."
Ben Wyatt,Little G.H.
Ben Wyatt,Bring it in.
Ben Wyatt,Come on
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,I think our love made him angry.
Ben Wyatt,I think he broke my wrist.
Ben Wyatt,I'm not kidding.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Chris Traeger,"Good morning, Ann Perkins."
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling today?
Ann Perkins,Perfect.
Ann Perkins,Except that I'm a whale and that my feet already kill.
Chris Traeger,Whales don't have feet.
Ann Perkins,I am a crazy shape.
Ann Perkins,"This morning when I got out of bed, I just tipped forward like a poorly made bowling pin."
Ann Perkins,Did I mention that my feet kill me all the time?
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Chris Traeger,Let me rub them.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, wait."
Chris Traeger,No.
Chris Traeger,I read something on raddadsolutions.net that there's a pressure point in the foot that could induce labor.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, it doesn't matter."
Ann Perkins,I don't care.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna go choke down those horse pills I have to take every day.
Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, no, I'll cut them in half for you."
Chris Traeger,And I will pour you a glass of flaxseed milk to wash it down.
Chris Traeger,Everything is amazing.
Chris Traeger,"Today is perfect, and I love you."
Ann Perkins,Chris is so wonderful and thoughtful and positive.
Ann Perkins,He's driving me up the  wall.
Chris Traeger,Smoothie's ready!
Leslie Knope,Opening this farmers market was one of my greatest achievements as city councilor.
Leslie Knope,"It's good for the economy, it's good for families, and it's good for promoting a healthy lifestyle, which Pawnee desperately needs."
Extra,Look at this tiny tree.
Extra,Can you eat this?
Extra,Aww.
Extra,This one's dead.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Connie Cabbage."
Leslie Knope,What's good today?
Connie Cabbage,Green cabbage is always a safe bet.
Connie Cabbage,Red cabbage is good.
Connie Cabbage,"I mean, you can't go wrong."
Connie Cabbage,That's the fun thing about cabbage.
Ben Wyatt,One of the fun things.
Connie Cabbage,Oh!
Nolan,"Time to crank this market up a notch, y'all!"
Ben Wyatt,"""Chardbodies: Get a chard on""?"
Nolan,"Let's get ""recharded"" in here!"
Leslie Knope,What the hell is going on?
Connie Cabbage,"Oh, yeah."
Connie Cabbage,That's the new chard stand.
Connie Cabbage,I suppose that's one way to sell vegetables.
Nolan,"We got Swiss chard, we got white chard, we got chard poppers!"
Nolan,And for all you freaky vegans out there... We got chard shots!
Extra,Yeah!
Extra,"Mmm, chard is so bitter."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, do something."
Ben Wyatt,What do you want me to do?
Leslie Knope,"Well, you're the city manager."
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Leslie Knope,They're violating every single one of the farmers market's rules of conduct.
Ben Wyatt,"By ""rules of conduct,"" do you mean that wooden sign you made that says, ""Peas be kind to others""?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and ""In case of fire, romaine calm,"" and ""You won't bay leaf how nice olive our vendors are."""
Leslie Knope,"I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I admit this is a little iffy, but"
Leslie Knope,A little iffy?
Ben Wyatt,I can't do anything until I check the rules for city vendors.
Connie Cabbage,Cabbage!
Connie Cabbage,Come and get it.
Leslie Knope,"Connie, no."
Leslie Knope,Put those away.
Andy Dwyer,"April's sitting on my lap, I shouldn't tell her that I gotta take a crap, oh, no"
April Ludgate,Don't.
Andy Dwyer,I should just go
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, my God."
Craig Middlebrooks,You play guitar?
April Ludgate,"No, that's a super small piano."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, I'm gonna need the sarcasm to take a long walk right now."
Craig Middlebrooks,"My terrible nephew Sebastian is having his sixth birthday party this weekend, and the clown they hired has shingles."
Craig Middlebrooks,You think your band could play for an hour?
April Ludgate,How much?
Craig Middlebrooks,75
Andy Dwyer,"75,000 dollars?"
April Ludgate,How about 300?
Andy Dwyer,"300,000 dollars?"
Craig Middlebrooks,150
April Ludgate,They'll do it.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Ah, thank you."
Craig Middlebrooks,That is such a relief.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I love my nephew very much, but he's a horrible little tyrant, so don't ruin this day for him!"
Andy Dwyer,150 bucks?
Andy Dwyer,"Split that four ways, boom."
Andy Dwyer,600 dollars.
Tom Haverford,I'll say it again: The men's room needs a separate dispenser for face wash.
Tom Haverford,I can't wash my face with hand soap.
Tom Haverford,Look at these pores.
Tom Haverford,They're gaping.
Ann Perkins,"Hey, guys."
Tom Haverford,Timeout.
Tom Haverford,Let's take a brief recess.
Tom Haverford,"Can we help you, Ann?"
Ann Perkins,"I was looking for Leslie, but now I'm curious why you guys are sitting around doing nothing and getting drunk at work."
Tom Haverford,"It's the whine & cheese club, gorgeous."
Tom Haverford,It's a monthly gathering where we all get together and vent about what annoys us at work.
Donna Meagle,"Over fine wines and cheeses, of course."
Ron Swanson,"Larry, salami!"
Ron Swanson,The human resources department requires that I be available once a month to discuss workplace disputes with my employees.
Ron Swanson,The rules do not specify whether or not I'm allowed to listen to Willie Nelson on my headphones.
Jerry Gergich,And Kyle parked his car in my spot again.
Jerry Gergich,"Now, that is the fourth time this month."
Music,"Hello, walls Hello Hello how'd things go for you today?"
Jerry Gergich,I just want to choke him until he passes out.
Tom Haverford,Time.
Ann Perkins,This looks like fun.
Ann Perkins,I want to try.
Tom Haverford,"Mm, there's rules to this, sweet pea."
Tom Haverford,It's Donna's turn next.
Donna Meagle,I'll cede my time to Ann.
Donna Meagle,I have a feeling this is gonna be good.
Ann Perkins,"Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk for long, 'cause I have to pee again, 'cause I have to pee every six minutes, 'cause I have a beach ball in my stomach that's punching on my bladder."
Donna Meagle,That sucks.
Ann Perkins,I know.
Ann Perkins,And I'm never not hungry.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, have some cheese."
Ann Perkins,"I can't have cheese, Larry!"
Ann Perkins,And I can't have wine either.
Ann Perkins,I can't have anything good.
Ann Perkins,"You know, what I can have is liquefied flaxseed."
Ann Perkins,But I don't want that.
Ann Perkins,You know what I want?
Ann Perkins,Pork rinds.
Ann Perkins,I want jelly beans.
Ann Perkins,And I want a huge trash bag filled with mashed potatoes.
Ann Perkins,"I want to be PacMan, and instead of dots, I want 'em to be cinnamon buns."
Ann Perkins,"I want to be a giant head and a mouth, and I just want to eat rows and rows of junk food pellets, and where's my trash bag of potatoes?"
Tom Haverford,Time.
Donna Meagle,Yikes.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Harrison Ford movie night."
Leslie Knope,"Before we do that, I was thinking more about that chard guy."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, it would be very easy for you to revoke their license."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, this is city business, and I'm not an emperor."
Ben Wyatt,I can't just kick them out for no reason.
Leslie Knope,The reason is it's vegetable porn.
Leslie Knope,Porn on the cob.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,I'm just very good at that.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am not a prude, but the point is, people shouldn't be half naked, you know, in public, in the middle of the day, in front of children."
Leslie Knope,There's your reason.
Leslie Knope,Kick them out.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, now that we're working together again, maybe it would be good to keep our home life and our work life separate."
Ben Wyatt,"Like we only talk about work stuff when we're at city hall, like a firewall system."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,That's smart.
Leslie Knope,"Home is home, and work is work."
Leslie Knope,We can always talk about this tomorrow at the office.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,Glad you agree.
Ben Wyatt,All right.
Ben Wyatt,Crystal Skull it is.
Ben Wyatt,"No, it's ridiculous to think that you could survive a nuclear blast by jumping into a refrigerator."
Leslie Knope,"Mmhmm, yeah, uh-huh."
Ben Wyatt,"But still, it's like"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I found a legal precedent to shut down those vegetable smut peddlers."
Ben Wyatt,What is happening?
Leslie Knope,"Firewall, man."
Leslie Knope,"We pulled into the parking lot, and this is technically city hall property, so now we're at work let's do this."
Leslie Knope,"The farmers market is a community meeting place, and that pansexual stripper show basically negates the whole purpose."
Leslie Knope,"So if you're looking for a reason to kick them out, here's 158."
Leslie Knope,The new farmers market rule book.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, when did you make this?"
Leslie Knope,I stayed up all night.
Leslie Knope,I also made these: Leslie's toffee surprise.
Leslie Knope,The surprise is there's toffee in the inside.
Leslie Knope,You can eat those once you revoke the chard vendor's license.
Leslie Knope,"Good day, colleague."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!
Chris Traeger,How are you feeling?
Ann Perkins,You don't want to know.
Chris Traeger,It's all I want to know.
Ann Perkins,"All right, man, you asked for it."
Ann Perkins,I have shooting pains that go all the way up from my butt to my neck.
Ann Perkins,My stomach has so many stretch marks on it that it looks like an old-fashioned globe.
Ann Perkins,My boobs are getting really sore.
Ann Perkins,"Also, I just read Brooke Shields' book on postpartum depression."
Ann Perkins,Now I have pre-postpartum depression anxiety.
Chris Traeger,"Well, never fear."
Chris Traeger,I will get you Tylenol for your pain and shea butter for your belly.
Chris Traeger,And your voluptuous figure only means your body is working exactly as nature intended it.
Chris Traeger,"There, it's all good."
Chris Traeger,Is that better?
Ann Perkins,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Chris Traeger,I've been reading up on nipples.
Chris Traeger,"The reason that you're feeling nipple sensitivity is because your milk ducts in your nipples are opening up, which is why I bought you this nipple kit."
Chris Traeger,It's from Kernsten's: the nipple people.
Chris Traeger,"It has nipple cream, nipple pads, and also a special nipple pimple ointment in case you develop any pimples on your nipples."
Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God, you have to stop using the word ""nipple."""
Chris Traeger,Okay.
Chris Traeger,Anyway.
Chris Traeger,Hopefully that will help you with any sensitivity that may arise around your boob hats.
Ann Perkins,"Larry, get in there!"
Ann Perkins,Come on!
Jerry Gergich,What do
Jerry Gergich,I don't even know what we're doing.
Ron Swanson,"What is the meaning of this, nurse?"
Ann Perkins,Emergency whine & cheese club.
Ann Perkins,"Put your headphones on, Ron."
Ann Perkins,I have a lot of complaints.
Ann Perkins,Sit down.
Ann Perkins,I need to vent.
Ann Perkins,And do not under any circumstances respond to anything I say.
Ann Perkins,All right.
Ann Perkins,"Let's talk about vomit, kids."
Ann Perkins,I do it all day long.
Andy Dwyer,Super fun it feels super good I wanna do it all the time sex is cool
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, Sex Is Cool."
Andy Dwyer,Got that.
Andy Dwyer,I say we finish on Drunk Off Our Asses.
Andy Dwyer,And I think we should do Sex in Space.
Andy Dwyer,"It's 20 minutes long, but it's really good."
April Ludgate,"Babe, I don't think you should play any of those songs for a group of six year olds."
Burly,"Whoa, wait six year olds?"
Burly,Did you book us a gig at a kids' party?
Burly,You said we were playing at a festival.
Chang,You said Dave Grohl might be there.
Andy Dwyer,Dave Grohl might be there.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know.
Andy Dwyer,He might be anywhere.
Andy Dwyer,"The guy's awesome, and he's unpredictable."
Burly,"No, no, I'm not playing for a bunch of screaming kids."
Burly,Mouse Rat is a rock band.
Burly,We're not the Wiggles.
Andy Dwyer,Come on!
Rivers,I'm sick of all the drama with this band.
Rivers,I quit.
Rivers,I'm going back to rabbinical school.
Andy Dwyer,Umbilical school?
Andy Dwyer,"Rivers, come back."
Andy Dwyer,"Rivers, don't do this."
Andy Dwyer,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Shaq might be there!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, did you get a chance to sign off on that booklet I gave you?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I read it, but it seems like your farmers market rules may be specifically targeting chardbodies."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How?
Ben Wyatt,"""No visible cleavage."""
Ben Wyatt,"""No strobe lights."""
Ben Wyatt,"""No chard-related innuendo."""
Leslie Knope,Those apply to all vendors.
Leslie Knope,"Either way, it's too late."
Leslie Knope,The train has left the station.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what train, from which station?"
Nolan,You're revoking my license?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, Nolan, under the auspices of the office of city manager, et cetera, et cetera, it's not important, you are in violation of many rules, and therefore you cannot sell your goods anymore at the Pawnee farmers market."
Leslie Knope,"Ben, back me up on this without hesitation."
Ben Wyatt,"Nolan, can I have a second to speak with my-- with Ms. Knope for a second?"
Nolan,"Look, chard is disgusting."
Nolan,You try selling it without sexy dancers.
Nolan,It's impossible.
Nolan,"It's like, ""Hey, you like lettuce?"""
Nolan,"""Try this."""
Nolan,It's worse.
Nolan,It tastes like kale took a dump on spinach.
Leslie Knope,I like to think of it as celery with B.O.
Leslie Knope,"But if it's so gross, you should just sell something else."
Nolan,I inherited this farm from my dad.
Nolan,It's all I have.
Nolan,"Plus, the other vendors want me there."
Nolan,I'm good for business.
Ben Wyatt,We're not revoking your license.
Ben Wyatt,For now.
Ben Wyatt,I am sorry you had to come in.
Leslie Knope,Judas!
Ben Wyatt,"I don't appreciate being ambushed, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,Let's just go home.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're trying to do.
Leslie Knope,"If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore."
Leslie Knope,"Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.M."
Leslie Knope,And we will solve this chard issue once and for all.
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your approval pen.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,There's no such thing.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there is."
Leslie Knope,I made it for you last night.
Ann Perkins,"Ugh, and Lamaze class, wait till I tell you about that Ponzi scheme."
Ann Perkins,Ugh.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, hey, Donna, what the hell?"
Ann Perkins,You know I can't be around smoke or fatty tuna.
Ann Perkins,Ron--
Donna Meagle,"At first, this was funny, but it's gotten out of hand."
Donna Meagle,"This was our chance to vent about work, and you've taken it over."
Tom Haverford,Yeah!
Tom Haverford,It's sushi and cigar club now.
Ann Perkins,Wow.
Ann Perkins,Okay.
Ann Perkins,I see how it is.
Tom Haverford,I feel bad.
Donna Meagle,I don't.
Donna Meagle,This is a Cuban.
Donna Meagle,This is yellowtail.
Donna Meagle,I feel amazing.
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,Monster in the window!
Ann Perkins,You know what my biggest complaint is?
Ann Perkins,"I have a million things I need to complain about, and I can't take them home because Chris is the most considerate person in the world, and he just wants to help me, and then I feel bad about that, and then I get annoyed that he wants to help me, and I feel even worse about that!"
Ann Perkins,"I thought you guys would be cool with me complaining 'cause it's all you do, is sit here and complain without judgment or guilt."
Ann Perkins,But you know what?
Ann Perkins,I guess I was wrong.
Ann Perkins,And you know what?
Ann Perkins,"I would yell some more, but I think I just peed my pants a little bit."
Ron Swanson,What's happening now?
Ron Swanson,Is the nurse upset?
Ron Swanson,I don't care.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, 6:00."
Leslie Knope,Let's do this.
Leslie Knope,Larry?
Jerry Gergich,Mm.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, Leslie."
Jerry Gergich,"Ben couldn't make it, so he asked me to read you this."
Jerry Gergich,"""Dear honey"" Oh, how sweet."
Leslie Knope,Read.
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,"""Sorry, but I think we just need to take a break from this work issue."""
Jerry Gergich,"""Please don't grind your teeth too hard when you hear this."""
Jerry Gergich,"""I will see you in the car."""
Jerry Gergich,"""I love you."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, that is so sweet that you still write love letters to"
Leslie Knope,What the hell are you doing out here?
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, babe."
Ben Wyatt,I am off city hall property.
Ben Wyatt,You have to stop.
Ben Wyatt,Firewall.
Leslie Knope,Wrong.
Leslie Knope,"All roads and bridges fall under the purview of the Pawnee department of transportation, which is located on the fourth floor of city hall."
Leslie Knope,Firewall down.
Leslie Knope,"Stay frosty, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,We're just getting started.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's interesting."
Ben Wyatt,You know why?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Ben Wyatt,Because
Leslie Knope,Mother
Ben Wyatt,Haha!
Ben Wyatt,Bank!
Ben Wyatt,Private property.
Ben Wyatt,Firewall restored!
Leslie Knope,Hahaha!
Leslie Knope,The concrete that you're standing on was poured by a municipal construction crew.
Ben Wyatt,"Private fountain, private property."
Ben Wyatt,I'm safe.
Leslie Knope,Guess where the water comes from.
Leslie Knope,The Pawnee reservoir.
Leslie Knope,"You can't escape city hall, fool!"
Leslie Knope,Let's dance.
Chris Traeger,"Hey, friends."
Chris Traeger,I'm just about to go on my night jog.
Chris Traeger,Would you like to join me?
Donna Meagle,"Mm, hard pass."
Donna Meagle,We're here because you need to tend to your woman.
Donna Meagle,"She's complaining about everything, ruining whine & cheese club."
Chris Traeger,I literally have 1000 questions.
Chris Traeger,Why is Ron wearing headphones?
Chris Traeger,What's whine & cheese club?
Chris Traeger,And what is Ann complaining about?
Donna Meagle,"You, mostly how you never let her vent because you're always too busy trying to solve everything for her."
Chris Traeger,She's upset that I'm trying to help her?
Ron Swanson,"You've fallen into a classic trap, Christopher trying to fix a woman's problems instead of just listening to what they are!"
Chris Traeger,Why are you yelling?
Ron Swanson,Tom put all my records into this rectangle!
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, if Ann needs Tylenol, she can get it herself."
Tom Haverford,"What she needs from you is to just look her in the eyes, nod your head, and say those two magic words."
Donna Meagle,"""That sucks."""
Chris Traeger,"""That sucks""?"
Tom Haverford,I spent my entire life reading instructional books about relationships in order to trick women into liking me.
Tom Haverford,"When Ann tells you what's bothering her, don't try to fix it."
Tom Haverford,"Just say, ""Damn, that sucks."""
Ron Swanson,The songs just play one right after the other!
Ron Swanson,This is an excellent rectangle!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, this is insane."
Leslie Knope,"It is 40 degrees, and we are standing in freezing water."
Ben Wyatt,"No, this is our motivation."
Ben Wyatt,We are not leaving this fountain until we've figured this out once and for all.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Why are you not supporting me on this?
Leslie Knope,I thought you agreed with me.
Ben Wyatt,"I do, as a person, but as city manager, I'm not 100% sure you have a case."
Ben Wyatt,You're not listening to my side.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, sometimes when we disagree, you're so passionate, I feel like I'm arguing with the sun."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,That is totally crazy!
Leslie Knope,I am super chill all the time!
Ben Wyatt," Look, let's just admit it."
Ben Wyatt, We're in a weird position.
Ben Wyatt, We're married.
Ben Wyatt," Our professional status has flipped, like, five times."
Ben Wyatt," I mean, now I'm your boss."
Ben Wyatt," This is ""un-charded"" territory for us."
Leslie Knope," Oh, that's nice."
Ben Wyatt, Thanks.
Ben Wyatt, I learned from the best.
Ben Wyatt," The point is, forget firewalls."
Ben Wyatt," Let's just be respectful and communicate, and we'll find the right balance."
Leslie Knope, You're right.
Leslie Knope, I should have considered your side.
Leslie Knope," I love you, and you're also a very smart person."
Ben Wyatt, Let's get out of this fountain.
Leslie Knope, I can't because my legs are numb.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, I can't move."
Ben Wyatt, Are we gonna die here?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Craig Middlebrooks," No, don't do that."
Craig Middlebrooks, I don't like this game.
Craig Middlebrooks, I don't know what the rules are!
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, babe, here's what I did."
Andy Dwyer, Tell me if this is appropriate for a kids' song.
Andy Dwyer," I changed the lyrics in Sex Hair to You got sex bears you got 'em from me, kids sexbears big ol' sex bears"
April Ludgate,"Andy, the word ""hair"" was not the problem with Sex Hair."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, it's sex! Oh, crap."
Andy Dwyer, Now what the hell am I supposed to sing?
Craig Middlebrooks,"It's time, Andrew."
Craig Middlebrooks," These kids are tearing my house apart, and I need you to calm them with the power of song."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, gosh, here's the thing-- I can't do it."
Andy Dwyer, I got laryngitis.
Craig Middlebrooks," You will not bail on me, Andrew Dwyer."
Craig Middlebrooks, You will perform.
Craig Middlebrooks," My nephew is something of an outcast in his school, and I got Erica Swarvane to come, which is a huge get."
Craig Middlebrooks, She rules the first grade.
Craig Middlebrooks," And this party will determine his social status for the next hundred years! So you better get out there, or I am going to lose it!"
April Ludgate,Have you not lost it?
Craig Middlebrooks,"Oh, you don't even know!"
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I'm freaking out."
April Ludgate, Listen to me.
April Ludgate, You make up songs all the time off the top of your head.
April Ludgate, You do.
April Ludgate," You can do this, and afterwards, we can have cake."
Andy Dwyer, I already had cake.
April Ludgate, Andy!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, focus up, you little monsters! Not you, Erica."
Craig Middlebrooks," You're an angel, and we're thrilled you're here."
Craig Middlebrooks," Now, is everyone ready to hear the best music you've ever heard in your miserable little lives?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, then, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome-- what even do you call yourself? Oh, it's too late! Please welcome Johnny Karate and his magical guitar stick!"
Andy Dwyer,"Uh  It feels super good it's super fun I wanna do it all the time pick your nose 'Cause boogers are gross clean out your snout You can pick your nose with your smelly toes Ew! He's doing it! You're picking your nose, and you put it on your friend! Ha-ha, I started that."
Andy Dwyer, Great!  Everybody pees the bed just something that we do I for instance peed the bed until I was 32.
Andy Dwyer,Don't play with matches they're really not safe  your parents keep 'em in a drawer with twist ties and batteries 
Andy Dwyer,My name is Bert Macklin.
Andy Dwyer, I investigate stinky feet for the FBI.
Andy Dwyer,  Stinky feet patrol stinky feet patrol Stinky feet patrol! Stinky feet patrol!
Andy Dwyer,This is so fun.
Andy Dwyer, I cannot believe this only cost me 150 bucks.
Chris Traeger," Oh, hey."
Chris Traeger, How was your day?
Ann Perkins,It was okay.
Ann Perkins, Now my legs really hurt.
Ann Perkins," It's like I have a tension headache, but in my calves."
Ann Perkins, A new surprise every day.
Chris Traeger, That sucks.
Ann Perkins, I know.
Ann Perkins, And I'm so gassy.
Ann Perkins," There's just been, like, a long, slow fart stream coming out of me since we started talking this morning."
Chris Traeger, That really sucks.
Ann Perkins, Yeah.
Ann Perkins, It does.
Ann Perkins, Thanks.
Chris Traeger, I'm sorry that I was trying to fix all your problems.
Ann Perkins," Oh, God, don't apologize."
Ann Perkins, I'm sorry I was such a freak.
Ann Perkins," You're the nicest, most thoughtful baby daddy a girl could ask for."
Craig Middlebrooks, That was incredible.
Craig Middlebrooks," You are overflowing with talent, and I admire you."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Extra, Excuse me.
Extra,Mr. Karate?
Andy Dwyer,Mr. Karate!
Extra,My son wants you to sing at his birthday party next weekend.
Extra,Are you available?
April Ludgate,"He is, but it's actually $250 for short notice."
April Ludgate, You can call this number and ask for April Karate.
Extra," Yes, I will."
April Ludgate,Babe
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate, That was amazing.
April Ludgate, I kind of think you can make a career out of this.
Andy Dwyer," But, I mean, I don't know."
Andy Dwyer,What does that make me-- a kids' performer? I'm supposed to be a rock star.
Andy Dwyer, You just had fun in there and made $150.
April Ludgate, Who cares about what you were supposed to be?
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Plus, you have never been sexier to me than when you were singing to those kids just now."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer," Well, that's weird."
Leslie Knope," Nolan, I'm very sorry that I overreacted and overstepped my bounds."
Nolan, I understand.
Nolan," When I got into the chard game, I knew I'd ruffle some feathers."
Ben Wyatt, Sure.
Ben Wyatt, I'm just glad that we could all come to an agreement.
Leslie Knope," All right, everybody, it is now 5:00 P.M., which means the farmers market is closed."
Nolan, And farmers market after dark is open for business!
Ben Wyatt,"Well, if this is the way people want to buy their produce, so be it."
Ben Wyatt, This town is full of lunatics.
Leslie Knope, Ugh!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, this was a terrible idea."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, it's like a tree barfed in my mouth."
Ben Wyatt, Bleh.

Leslie Knope,"What do you mean, you can't?"
Leslie Knope,"Look I am throwing a farewell party for my best friend, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,"And if she casually mentioned 3 years ago that she thought indoor fireworks would be cool then guess what, you're gonna give me indoor fireworks."
Leslie Knope,Tonight's biggest surprise is 5 years in the making.
Leslie Knope,It all goes back to when I first met my best friend.
Ann Perkins,I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.
Ann Perkins,"I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and it's government owned and you need to do something about it."
Leslie Knope,I will help you.
Ann Perkins,Is that a promise?
Leslie Knope,It's more than a promise.
Leslie Knope,It's a pinky promise.
Leslie Knope,That promise launched a friendship so grand it takes 103 scrapbooks to capture it.
Leslie Knope,"I have secretly arranged to officially break ground on Pawnee commons at midnight, fulfilling my pinky promise that I made five years ago."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, ice cream sandwich taste test!"
Leslie Knope,That was our biggest fight.
Harold,"Hey, Knope."
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Harold,You're breaking ground on the Pawnee commons tonight?
Harold,Public works never signed off on that.
Leslie Knope,"Look, your office was giving me a hard time, so I had to call in a few favors."
Harold,I don't like it when people go over my head.
Leslie Knope,Understood.
Leslie Knope,I will make a note of that.
Leslie Knope,Would you like a treat?
Harold,I run that department and I do not appreciate--
Harold,"Damn, that's really good."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,There's gonna be a lot of these at the party.
Leslie Knope,You should come by.
Harold,I know-- I get it.
Harold,I know what you're doing.
Harold,And I still-- is there a little crunch in there?
Leslie Knope,Hazelnut.
Harold,Ooh.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, right?"
Leslie Knope,See you tonight.
April Ludgate,"Okay, well, let's go set up this party."
Leslie Knope,"April, thank you."
Leslie Knope,"I know you may tease Ann, but deep down inside I can tell that you really care."
April Ludgate,Ann's leaving town and saying painful goodbyes to loved ones.
April Ludgate,Greatest day of my life!
Chris Traeger,Thank you all so much for helping me with these boxes.
Chris Traeger,"I'm just a little behind because every time I start, I get a little emotional."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, that box has my name on it."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, this one has my name on it."
Andy Dwyer,This one has plates' name on it.
Chris Traeger,You have just found your buddy boxes.
Chris Traeger,Each box contains a memento of our friendship.
Chris Traeger,"I was gonna give them to you later, but there is no time like the present."
Chris Traeger,Fun pun alert.
Ron Swanson,A bronzed hamburger.
Chris Traeger,"It's from our turkey versus beef cookoff, remember?"
Chris Traeger,You were a worthy adversary.
Ron Swanson,"I would have preferred a regular hamburger for eating, but this is very nice."
Ben Wyatt,2008 Indiana state audit spreadsheets?
Ben Wyatt,"Man, that year was insane!"
Chris Traeger,That was the year you went from being an auditor to a legend.
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,A picture of me officiating Leslie and Ben's wedding.
Jerry Gergich,"And look, you can just about see my head."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Tom Haverford,Snakejuice!
Tom Haverford,I thought these were destroyed by the FDA.
Chris Traeger,"I did have to go to a very seedy location to find it, but now I know where to go to place a bet on horse fighting."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't mention anything about the groundbreaking to Ann."
Leslie Knope,Repeat that back to me.
April Ludgate,"Tell Ann about the groundbreaking, frame Ann for murder, release a deadly virus into the water supply."
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Bon voyage, Ann."
Ann Perkins,"My God, this is amazing."
Leslie Knope,That's sparkling cider.
Ann Perkins,Why is there a New Year's Eve countdown clock and the Easter bunny?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know when we're gonna be able to visit each other, so just to be safe this party is a celebration of every event that's gonna happen this year."
Leslie Knope,"Your birthday, New Year's, Chinese New Year's, flag day."
Leslie Knope,Ain't no party like a Leslie Knope party 'cause a Leslie Knope party is actually 30 parties.
Ann Perkins,"Knope, you have outknoped yourself."
April Ludgate,Seems like the party's dying down.
April Ludgate,Weird.
April Ludgate,"Ann, you probably wanna head to Michigan forever, so I snuck into your house and packed a bag for you."
April Ludgate,Bye.
Ann Perkins,This is just a bunch of bras and knives.
Ann Perkins,And loose onions.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, party!"
Leslie Knope,Don't drink!
Leslie Knope,Have fun!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, so we have a little farewell gift for you."
Ben Wyatt,"We all pitched in and got you a gift card from that home store, ""Pots and Pans."""
Chris Traeger,We have been on the prowl for some amazing pots.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that card's for three pans."
Chris Traeger,"Either way, this is great."
Chris Traeger,You know what?
Chris Traeger,"We should get to the goodbye party, although I know it's mostly for Ann."
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, but there's, like, one corner for you and it's just carob cookies and berries."
Chris Traeger,Carob cookies and berries are literally my favorite dessert alternative.
Chris Traeger,I'll go get changed.
Ben Wyatt,"Man, he put a lot of work into our presents."
Ben Wyatt,I feel kinda bad just getting him a gift card.
Ron Swanson,I also shook his hand.
Ron Swanson,Twice.
Ron Swanson,Anything more than that would be excessive.
Tom Haverford,Let's all put our heads together and brainstorm.
Tom Haverford,We gotta send this dude off with the perfect gift.
Tom Haverford,"I say we start with the three ""Cs,"" cashmere, concert tickets, caboodles of cash."
Ben Wyatt,I feel like those are perfect gifts for you.
Tom Haverford,Those are perfect gifts for anyone.
Tom Haverford,"Ugh, I wish you guys were Donna!"
Ann Perkins,I'm 100% sure that I will not meet another Donna Meagle in Michigan.
Ann Perkins,I'm gonna miss you.
Donna Meagle,"You know, I'm gonna miss you too, Perkins."
Donna Meagle,"But now that you're officially out of the dating pool, you know I'm gonna run this town, right?"
Donna Meagle,Ooh.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah, you do not wanna go down that road."
Ann Perkins,"Trust me, I tried."
Ann Perkins,"Hi, Stephen."
Extra,"Hey, Ann."
Extra,Super cute baby bump.
Ann Perkins,Thanks.
Donna Meagle,Good looking out.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Ron, have you seen April?"
Ron Swanson,I've been mostly focused on these ribs.
Ron Swanson,"By the way, you're out of Easter ham and Thanksgiving turkey."
Ron Swanson,Great party.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Are you on the lot?
Leslie Knope,Is everything okay?
April Ludgate,"Uh, not really."
April Ludgate,"Public works put up a giant padlock on the fence and a sign that says ""No trespassing."""
Leslie Knope,That probably doesn't apply to us.
April Ludgate,"There's also a sign that says ""Especially Leslie Knope."""
Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie Knope is a very common name."
Leslie Knope,There's a professor in Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,They probably mean him.
Leslie Knope,Do they mean the professor?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, there's a picture of you also."
April Ludgate,And two huge security guards.
Leslie Knope,Holy mother of Malia!
Leslie Knope,And Sasha.
Leslie Knope,I love them both equally.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's that stupid Harold who's behind this."
Leslie Knope,Get here and we will make a plan.
Orin,How long do I have to do this?
Leslie Knope,"Until I say so, Orin!"
Leslie Knope,Stay in character.
Ann Perkins,Leslie can't watch anything with Julie Andrews in it before bedtime because it gets her too hyper.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"If Chris gets cranky around noon, just stuff some chia seeds into a fig works every time."
Ann Perkins,"Awesome, thank you."
Ann Perkins,"Wow, we really picked some intense people  to spend our lives with, huh?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ann Perkins,Where's Leslie?
Ann Perkins,I haven't seen her in a while.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, she's just running around trying to pull off an elaborate, thoughtful surprise for you."
Ann Perkins,Of course.
Ben Wyatt,Where's Chris?
Ann Perkins,"""I told him that One Headlight By the Wallflowers isn't ""dancing"" music and he said ""Not with that attitude."
Ben Wyatt,Of course.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, Ann, you know what I just remembered?"
Andy Dwyer,We used to date.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, we lived together for two years."
Andy Dwyer,"I know, it's crazy, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"Anyways, you're the best."
Andy Dwyer,Have fun in Mexico.
Leslie Knope,"Harold, it is Leslie Knope again."
Leslie Knope,"I know you are screening my calls, but if you could call me bac;k-- And his voicemail is full."
Leslie Knope,Did you have any luck?
Ben Wyatt,Flipped through the bylaws.
Ben Wyatt,I don't think there's anything I can do.
Leslie Knope,What is the point of being married to a city manager if he can't wield unfettered power to crush my enemies?
Ben Wyatt,Hopefully there are a few other reasons.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Looks like we hit a wall.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,April?
Leslie Knope,Are you okay?
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
April Ludgate,I'm just so scared that this means that Ann won't really leave.
Tom Haverford,"Life, huh?"
Tom Haverford,It's quite a ride.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, Tom, it is."
Tom Haverford,I got you a going away present.
Tom Haverford,I'm deleting you from my phone.
Tom Haverford,You're finally free of my animal magnetism.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe one day years from now when we're both old and Chris is dead, you'll run into me somewhere."
Tom Haverford,I'll be opening my latest mega club.
Tom Haverford,"I'll see you there on the street by yourself and I'll tell the bouncer/my bodyguard, ""Hey, that woman's way too old to get into this club, but why don't you let her in the back?"""
Ann Perkins,That's very generous.
Tom Haverford,"Stay golden, sweetheart."
Ann Perkins,"I'm gonna miss you too, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Shh.
Jerry Gergich,And you're kind and you're thoughtful and you're always such a delight to have around.
Jerry Gergich,I am sure you are going to be an incredible mother.
Ann Perkins,"Thanks, Larry."
Ann Perkins,That's nice.
Ron Swanson,"Goodbye, Ann."
Ron Swanson,I have enjoyed parts of our time together.
Ann Perkins,"Oh, God, Ron."
Jerry Gergich,That was really something.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, what do we have for Chris?"
Andy Dwyer,I got this City of Pawnee mug.
Andy Dwyer,"Also, this cool jacket."
Jerry Gergich,"No, I think that's Chris's jacket."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, good, then we know he likes it."
Andy Dwyer,"Catch up, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I found some old receipts from lunches we had together."
Ben Wyatt,Is that anything?
Ron Swanson,This is my contribution.
Ron Swanson,"It says ""Ron."""
Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys, what's going on?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we're just giving you a bunch of cool gifts."
Ben Wyatt,"No, God oh God."
Andy Dwyer,"Get your hopes up, Chris."
Chris Traeger,Let's see what's in here.
Chris Traeger,Some assorted items.
Chris Traeger,And some pieces of paper.
Andy Dwyer,"Boom, nailed it."
Andy Dwyer,All right.
Andy Dwyer,Now we can start enjoying this party.
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, this is the most incredible event that has ever been thrown."
Ann Perkins,There is a pilgrim line dancing with a box of candies.
Ann Perkins,Why do you look so bummed out?
Leslie Knope,We were planning a surprise groundbreaking at Pawnee commons for you.
Leslie Knope,"You know, an actual beginning to the project that brought us together."
Leslie Knope,But now we can't do it because Harold is such a jerk face.
Leslie Knope,He put a barbed wire fence around the lot and now it's not happening.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, Ann."
Ann Perkins,"First of all, don't apologize."
Ann Perkins,"And second of all, screw Harold."
Ann Perkins,"If I learned one thing from Leslie Knope it is we do not take ""No"" for an answer."
Ann Perkins,Anything is possible if we work hard enough.
Ann Perkins,Let's do it.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Ann Perkins to the rescue.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, hands in, everybody."
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Leslie Knope,Groundbreaking!
Ann Perkins,Let's go!
April Ludgate,"Dark forces, arise!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I didn't plan what we were all gonna say."
Leslie Knope,That's my bad.
Leslie Knope,"Here we go, Ann."
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, knock or ring the bell?"
Ann Perkins,Bust in unannounced.
Leslie Knope,Love it!
Leslie Knope,Harold.
Harold,"What the hell, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,We need the key to the fence that you put up on the Sullivan Street lot.
Harold,You snuck around behind my back.
Harold,I told you I didn't like that.
Harold,Forget it.
Ann Perkins,"Come on, Harold, look."
Ann Perkins,This is a great opportunity you have right now.
Ann Perkins,Just think of us as your genies who can give you anything you want.
Ann Perkins,Nothing gross.
Harold,"Okay, yeah, there is something I want."
Harold,Super fizzy fruity pop.
Leslie Knope,Sorry?
Harold,"Sweetums used to stock our office with free sodas as a promotional thing, but that Kathryn Pinewood lady just took 'em away."
Harold,"If you can get us our free sodas back, I'll get you a key."
Ann Perkins,Deal.
Leslie Knope,Easy.
Leslie Knope,It is not easy.
Leslie Knope,Kathryn Pinewood is the person on earth who hates me the most.
Ann Perkins,"Well, luckily, you're with the person on earth who loves you the most."
Ann Perkins,Too cheesy?
Leslie Knope,"No, it's perfect."
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Leslie Knope,Don't leave.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Chris Traeger,"Donna, you are a remarkable woman, and I just wanted to say that I've always thought of you as family."
Donna Meagle,I just wanna say that I've always thought you were hot.
Chris Traeger,"Yes, I know."
Chris Traeger,April--
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you saw a lot of potential in me, I'm like a daughter to you, and it was a treat to watch me blossom."
April Ludgate,"Blah blah blah, bye."
Chris Traeger,That is remarkably close to what I was going to say.
Chris Traeger,"Also, I'm proud of you."
Chris Traeger,"Donna, are you grabbing my butt?"
Donna Meagle,Can you blame me?
Chris Traeger,No!
Kathryn Pinewood,"Sorry, can't help you ladies."
Kathryn Pinewood,I don't have time for disgraced former politicians and unmarried preggos.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Kathryn, always a delight."
Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know that you and Leslie have had your disagreements in the past, but we really need the key, and we can only get the key if we get the sodas."
Ann Perkins,Please?
Kathryn Pinewood,I don't see why I should do you any favors.
Kathryn Pinewood,"I mean, if you were still a city councilor, maybe."
Kathryn Pinewood,But I seem to remember you were recalled.
Kathryn Pinewood,Is that right?
Leslie Knope,How dare you-- 
Ann Perkins,"Okay, Leslie."
Ann Perkins,Please.
Ann Perkins,It's not worth it.
Ann Perkins,For you.
Ann Perkins,"For me, I don't care."
Kathryn Pinewood,What the hell?
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, Pinewood, that's right."
Ann Perkins,I'm pregnant and I have you in a headlock.
Ann Perkins,"And if you try to fight back, I will sue you."
Ann Perkins,Unless you tell us how to get those sodas right now.
Kathryn Pinewood,"Okay, fine."
Kathryn Pinewood,Sweetums has been desperately trying to get a local celebrity spokesman to endorse their new sports drink.
Kathryn Pinewood,"So if you can make that happen somehow, they'll give you whatever you want."
Leslie Knope,"Damn, Perkins."
Ann Perkins,"Okay, who does Sweetums want as their spokesperson?"
Pete Disellio,They already tried to get me to endorse that sports drink.
Pete Disellio,"I said ""No."""
Pete Disellio,They want me dunking on the label.
Pete Disellio,When is this town gonna realize that I'm more than a former high school basketball star?
Leslie Knope,I don't think this new sports drink is even about basketball.
Pete Disellio,"It's called ""Sweetums dunktastic threepoint Bball blast"" the slogan is ""It's all about basketball."""
Pete Disellio,"I'm sorry, you're gonna have to find yourself some other famous pawneean."
Leslie Knope,"We know that you were already approached by Sweetums and you said ""No,"" but is there any way you would reconsider?"
Perd Hapley,"I'm sorry, Miss Knope."
Perd Hapley,"There is such a thing as journalistic integrity, and it is something that I have as a journalist with integrity."
Ann Perkins,"It's really important, Perd."
Ann Perkins,Please?
Ann Perkins,Come on.
Ann Perkins,For old time's sake.
Perd Hapley,"Well, the story of that appeal is it was heartfelt."
Perd Hapley,"And in response to that appeal, I respond: Okay."
Leslie Knope,For old time's sake?
Leslie Knope,Does that mean-- no!
Leslie Knope,"Ann, you tricky minx."
Ann Perkins,Yep.
Ann Perkins,I went on a date with Perd.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ann Perkins,"It was during that ""explore my freedom as a single woman"" phase."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ann Perkins,We just had a drink.
Ann Perkins,"And at the end he said, ""I am going to kiss you now by putting my mouth on your mouth."""
Ann Perkins,And then I ran away.
Leslie Knope,It was absolutely the right call.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, we could just tell him the truth that we feel bad that we didn't get him anything nice."
Tom Haverford,Tell the truth?
Tom Haverford,That's hilarious.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"We tell him we had the perfect gift, but we were robbed at gunpoint."
Tom Haverford,"""Chris, he had a gun."""
Tom Haverford,"""He took all the gifts."""
Tom Haverford,"Now Chris feels bad, he's buying us gifts."
Tom Haverford,"Next thing you know, Tommy's got a new watch."
Ron Swanson,"Again, I don't see the problem."
Ron Swanson,I shook the man's hand.
Ron Swanson,Twice.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, look what I got at the president's day booth."
Chris Traeger,Ask not what your country can do for you.
Andy Dwyer,"From Family Guy, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, Chris, we have to tell you something."
Ben Wyatt,We feel bad because you got us such thoughtful gifts and we got you three pans and a bag of nothing.
Chris Traeger,"Guys, I don't need anything from you."
Chris Traeger,"My buddy boxes are about the past, but let's focus on the future."
Chris Traeger,Because we're always gonna be friends.
Chris Traeger,And just the fact that you feel bad about your bag of nothing proves that.
Chris Traeger,To the future.
Jerry Gergich,"Hear, hear."
Ben Wyatt,To the future.
Tom Haverford,To the future.
Jerry Gergich,Cheers.
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.
Jerry Gergich,Future.
Harold,Don't you ladies ever knock?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so we got Perd Hapley to sign on with Sweetums, which means that you get your sodas back, which means that we get our key."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Everything's here in writing.
Leslie Knope,Now call off your guards.
Harold,Okay.
Harold,Fine.
Harold,You two are a couple of real pains in the ass.
Harold,You know that?
Leslie Knope,"Harold, your tiny brain could not understand this, but that is the best compliment you could ever give the two women standing in front of you."
Ann Perkins,"Bye, Harold."
Leslie Knope,Victory at last.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,All right.
April Ludgate,You're all set.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I am gonna call the official ceremonial ribbon cutting guy, 'cause I think we may have missed him."
Ann Perkins,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,It's for the raccoons.
Leslie Knope,You have to hiss really loud and stomp your feet so they'll leave you alone.
Leslie Knope,"And if one comes close, make yourself really large like a puffer fish."
Ann Perkins,Pawnee raccoons.
Ann Perkins,That is one thing I will not miss.
April Ludgate,"Well, Michigan has wolverines."
April Ludgate,Maybe they'll eat your toes.
Ann Perkins,So how long do you think you'll stay in Pawnee for?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,We like it here.
April Ludgate,"I made Andy promise that someday we'll move to Transylvania, but that probably won't happen till we're, like, 100."
Ann Perkins,"Well, for what it's worth, I'm really happy that you and Andy are married."
April Ludgate,Why?
Ann Perkins,Why?
Ann Perkins,Because I love him and I love you.
Ann Perkins,Why wouldn't I be happy?
April Ludgate,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,What's that?
April Ludgate,I love you too.
Ann Perkins,I couldn't-- I couldn't quite hear you.
April Ludgate,Please don't make me say it.
April Ludgate,Please.
Ann Perkins,My going away present to you will be that I do not make you audibly say that you love me.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"  Okay, Leslie's coming back."
April Ludgate,"Get off me, wench!"
Leslie Knope,Did I miss a nice moment?
April Ludgate,No.
Ann Perkins,"Yes, you did."
Leslie Knope," Oh, good."
Chris Traeger," Guys, what are you doing here? Come in."
Chris Traeger, You caught me before my first run of the day.
Chris Traeger," I call it my ""beat the sun"" run."
Chris Traeger, It's a race between me and the sun.
Ben Wyatt," Well, we got one more gift for you."
Ron Swanson, It's quarter-sawn zebra wood adjoined by floating tenons to the black walnut corner posts.
Ron Swanson, Finished with a wiping varnish that's a secret Swanson family recipe.
Ron Swanson," Handmade at my woodshop, and you are correct."
Ron Swanson, It is gorgeous.
Ben Wyatt," You're starting a new life with your new family, so it's an empty buddy box to fill with memories for your little buddy."
Andy Dwyer, Or twizzlers.
Andy Dwyer, That's the beautiful thing about a box.
Tom Haverford," We all burned our initials in, see?"
Chris Traeger,"Wait a minute, who's G-J-L-G-G?"
Jerry Gergich,That's Garry Jerry Larry Gergich Gengurch.
Jerry Gergich, I burned in all my names.
Jerry Gergich, I really-- I didn't know what to do.
Chris Traeger," Well, um Thank you."
Chris Traeger," Um, this tear, um, caused by the overwhelming thoughtfulness of my friends will be my baby's first memory."
Ron Swanson, Salt water will warp the wood.
Ron Swanson, So keep your tears in your eyes where they belong.
Chris Traeger," Will do, Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope, Can I still call you when I have thoughts on Jennifer Aniston's future?
Ann Perkins,Not if I call you first.
Leslie Knope, And can we still be on the phone for every state of the Union address and every Oscar red carpet coverage and every single viewing of Tootsie?
Ann Perkins,Of course.
Leslie Knope," Oh, Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope, You perfect sunflower.
Leslie Knope," You totally changed me, you know? You taught me how to balance my life, how to be patient."
Ann Perkins,Mm
Leslie Knope,How to be more patient.
Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's better."
Leslie Knope, How to throw bureaucratic caution to the wind when it came to Ben.
Leslie Knope," But most importantly, you taught me that I can't pull off a tulip skirt."
Ann Perkins, It's just not your shape.
Leslie Knope," Well, I don't think this ceremonial ribbon cutting guy is gonna make it."
Leslie Knope, Either he flaked or he tripped and impaled himself on his own giant scissors.
Ann Perkins, We wait for no man.
Ann Perkins, Let's do this.
Leslie Knope," One, two, three!"
Ann Perkins," One, two, three!"
Ann Perkins,"All right, I got my park."
Ann Perkins, That's all I wanted from you.
Ann Perkins, Friendship over.
Leslie Knope," Don't even joke about that, Ann."
Chris Traeger, It was your idea to get me that box.
Ben Wyatt," Ah, it was a group effort."
Chris Traeger, But it had that trademark Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful and resourceful.
Chris Traeger, You are literally the best friend that I will ever have.
Ben Wyatt," You too, man."
Chris Traeger, Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope, Chris Traeger.
Chris Traeger, I just wanna say that getting to know you and watching you work has been one of the greatest experiences of my life-- that and working with Dr.  Richard Nygard.
Leslie Knope," Sure, and I just want you to know that I thought there was no man on earth good enough for Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,And I still think that.
Chris Traeger, Right.
Leslie Knope," But if there is no one actually good enough for her, you are pretty damn close."
Leslie Knope," Okay, well, this is normal."
Leslie Knope, No big deal.
Leslie Knope,Drive safe.
Ann Perkins,We will.
Leslie Knope, I packed you some sandwiches and some caffeine free iced tea.
Leslie Knope," So-- oh, and there's a mix CD that I made already loaded in your car."
Leslie Knope," There's a lot of Sarah McLanahan, so, Chris, I apologize."
Leslie Knope, Things are gonna get emotional.
Ann Perkins, I love you.
Leslie Knope, I love you too.
Ron Swanson," Breakfast, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I don't know."
Ron Swanson, Come on.
Ron Swanson, There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food.
Leslie Knope, That's fair.
Leslie Knope, Someone else is gonna have to drive though.
Leslie Knope, My eyes are basically useless right now.
Tom Haverford, I'm on it.
Andy Dwyer, Shotgun! I called shotgun!
Andy Dwyer,You're all nailed.
April Ludgate,I call sitting on your lap.
Andy Dwyer, You can't-- I-- double shotgun! We call double shotgun! How come people don't do that more often?
Ben Wyatt,It's illegal.
Leslie Knope, Raise you hand if you want waffles.
Jerry Gergich, I'm eating waffles.
Ron Swanson," Bacon and eggs, please and thank you."

Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt were married one year ago this week at the Pawnee city hall."""
Leslie Knope,"""The bride wore a gown made by her friend Ann Perkins."""
Leslie Knope,"""And the groom wore a butt so perfect it could make an angel hang itself."""
Leslie Knope,"You wrote this, didn't you?"
Leslie Knope,I did.
Leslie Knope,They cut it way down.
Ben Wyatt,Thank God.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, the big day is tomorrow."
Ben Wyatt,So let's go over this again.
Ben Wyatt,What are the anniversary rules?
Leslie Knope,At lease 100 kisses.
Leslie Knope,Dinner at 7:00.
Leslie Knope,And no gifts.
Ben Wyatt,"That's right, no gifts."
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,No gifts.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm getting him a gift."
Leslie Knope,I always say that I'm not gonna get him a gift.
Leslie Knope,And Ben always believes me.
Leslie Knope,"And then, bam, I surprise him with the best gift of all time."
Leslie Knope,"He makes the cutest, dopiest face when he's surprised."
Leslie Knope,It's like Whaaaat?
Ben Wyatt,I'm not gonna make my stupid surprise face this year because this time I got her the most amazing gift ever.
Ben Wyatt,"And she'll never see it coming because I'm giving it to her today, one day early."
Ben Wyatt,So she's gonna make the face this year.
Ben Wyatt,She will make that stupid face!

Derry Murbles,Welcome to Thought For Your Thoughts.
Derry Murbles,"I'm your Pawneean host, Derry Murbles."
August Clementine,"And I'm your Eagletonian host, August Clementine."
Derry Murbles,"Yes, if you have not heard our program in a while, Thought For Your Thoughts now has a cohost, thanks to the Pawnee Eagleton merger"
August Clementine,"I believe that is the Eagleton Pawnee merger, n'estce pas?"
Derry Murbles,I'd like to apologize to our listeners for my cohost's sudden and violent outburst just now.
Derry Murbles,Our guest is former city councilwoman Leslie Knope.
Derry Murbles,"Leslie, thought--"
August Clementine,For your thoughts.
August Clementine,I said it.
Derry Murbles,"Absorb the aggression, Derry."
Derry Murbles,Absorb the aggression.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just want to say thank you so much for having me."
Leslie Knope,It's a thrill to be here.
Leslie Knope,"As a listener, I think the merging of your two shows has really created such a big, quiet, arcane ball of fun."
Leslie Knope,It's been a couple of months since Pawnee and Eagleton officially merged.
Leslie Knope,Things are going... okay.
Leslie Knope,There's still a little animosity between the two towns.
Leslie Knope,I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizza stuffed crust pizza.
Leslie Knope,It was a pizza whose crust was stuffed with little pizzas.
Leslie Knope,And the crust of those little pizzas was made of chocolate.
August Clementine,"Ms. Knope, I understand you're here today to try to convince us that this disastrous merger of our two towns was, in any way, a good idea."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, there were some bumps and bruises."
Leslie Knope,And a brief rash of arson.
Leslie Knope,And a rather large-scale brawl at the dump.
Leslie Knope,"But overall, the state of the merger is very strong."
August Clementine,Scoff.
Leslie Knope,"Did you just say the word ""scoff""?"
Derry Murbles,"You must admit, Ms. Knope, that the merging of the towns has been fraught with antipathy."
Derry Murbles,"For example, I now have to share my studio with a fatuous twerp who shall remain nameless."
August Clementine,This twerp has a name.
August Clementine,And it's August N'gutu Liebowitz-Clementine.
Leslie Knope,Guys... Hello.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much for letting me help plan your anniversary.
Jerry Gergich,It is so wonderful to be part of such a special day.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, remember, under no circumstances can Leslie know about what's going on."
Ben Wyatt,"She has to make that face, do you understand?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, I don't fully, but my lips are sealed."
Ben Wyatt,"I asked for Larry's help because he has the most successful marriage of anyone I know, to a gorgeous woman."
Ben Wyatt,"Which, honestly, is still a mystery to me."
Ben Wyatt,"Like, was it a hypnosis accident or something, where they put Gayle under and made her fall in love with Larry and never said the magic word to snap her out of it?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, if I say ""nutmeg,"" will she wake up and start screaming?"
April Ludgate,What kind of pet are you interested in adopting?
April Ludgate,"We have dogs, cats, rabbits."
April Ludgate,"Um, I work here, so, legally, you can adopt me."
Ron Swanson,The girls want an actual dog.
Ron Swanson,And they want it to look like this.
April Ludgate,Interesting.
April Ludgate,"So, like a banana made of spiders?"
Ron Swanson,"I've said it before and I'll say it again, children are terrible artists."
Ron Swanson,And artists are crooks.
April Ludgate,I think I know a good dog.
April Ludgate,There he is!
April Ludgate,"Ron, how about this guy?"
Ron Swanson,"Yes, he is a handsome fellow."
Ron Swanson,"Hello, dog."
Ron Swanson,I'll take him.
April Ludgate,That was easy.
April Ludgate,Awesome.
April Ludgate,"Well, Donna can help you get started on the paperwork."
April Ludgate,Donna?
Ron Swanson,"""Why lie?"""
Ron Swanson,"""I'm shopping."""
Ron Swanson,"""Back in an hour."""
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,"God, she's always just leaving and not telling me."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, caller."
Leslie Knope,You have a comment?
Extra,"Yeah, ever since the merger, we've had a really bad trash problem."
Leslie Knope,"Well, yes, there has been some confusion with some of the garbage routes."
Leslie Knope,And the Sanitation Department is stretched a little thin.
Extra,"No, I mean Eagletonians are human garbage."
Extra,And we should throw them in a dumpster.
Extra,Kapow!
Extra,"Yeah, I really like the merger, but I hate that Eagleton was forced to join Pawnee."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that's what the merger is."
Extra,Oh.
Extra,"Yeah, then I hate the merger."
Andy Dwyer,I think the merger was great.
Andy Dwyer,And I think Leslie Knope did an amazing job.
Leslie Knope,"I don't know who this is, but I agree."
Andy Dwyer,It's Andy!
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,I'm on the radio!
Derry Murbles,That's all the time we have on Thought For Your Thoughts.
Derry Murbles,I'm Derry Murbles.
August Clementine,And I'm August Clementine.
August Clementine,And I talked last.
August Clementine,Good day.
April Ludgate,Is this land mine still functional?
Ron Swanson,Partially.
Ron Swanson,Why?
April Ludgate,Because I want to blow up Donna's desk so I can teach her a lesson about what happens when you skip work.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure that's how you should go about this.
April Ludgate,"I'm kind of her boss, now, but I still feel weird disciplining her."
April Ludgate,What do I do?
Ron Swanson,Look her in the eyes and tell her exactly what you need from her.
Ron Swanson,"Be mature, direct, and firm."
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Some fool just slammed me on Yelp.
April Ludgate,I took Ron's advice.
April Ludgate,I very maturely and straightforwardly left anonymous comments about Donna online.
Donna Meagle,"""Stopped by to adopt a dog, but the employee, Donna Meagle, was nowhere to be found."""
Donna Meagle,"""Thanks for nothing, Donna Meagle."""
Donna Meagle,"""Booooo!"""
Donna Meagle,"With five ""O""s."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, that sucks."
April Ludgate,"Just have to work harder, I guess, huh?"
Donna Meagle,This freak thinks he can hide behind some anonymous user name?
Donna Meagle,I'm about to hunt you down.
Tom Haverford,"Don't be upset, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,No one listens to the radio.
Tom Haverford,I wasn't even listening.
Tom Haverford,I was listening to podcasts.
Tom Haverford,Podcasts are great.
Tom Haverford,Radio is boring.
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this merger needs a win-- something symbolic and bright and happy that will show that there's light at the end of the tunnel."
Leslie Knope,"God, I am so stressed."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you for a second?"
Jerry Gergich,Something very special to show you.
Leslie Knope,"Now is not the time, Larry."
Leslie Knope,Please leave.
Jerry Gergich,I think you--
Leslie Knope,Larry!
Leslie Knope,What are you still doing here?
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, jeez."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton were as happy as Ben and me.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, by the way, I was gonna mention, you look really old in this picture."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Andy, this is a picture of us."
Leslie Knope,This is a picture of an elderly couple.
Leslie Knope,Rosie and Doug DeMarco.
Leslie Knope,They've been married for 50 years.
Leslie Knope,"""Rosie Hails from Pawnee, while Doug is originally from the former Eagleton."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, this is perfect."
Leslie Knope,A Pawnee Eagleton couple that has been married for 50 years is a perfect symbol of how our towns can get along.
Leslie Knope,And we are gonna hold them up as an example of Pawnee Eagleton unity.
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,I'm getting the epiphany sweats.
Ben Wyatt,Stop where you are and take off your clothes.
Ben Wyatt,It's couples massage.
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,Where's Leslie?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, well, she seemed kind of stressed out."
Jerry Gergich,"And then she yelled at me, and she said she was too busy to come."
Jerry Gergich,And since you had said do not tell her the secret  under any circumstances-- 
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that's a danger of doing things a day early, I guess."
Ben Wyatt,Should I text her and try again?
Jerry Gergich,"Why don't you just go ahead and get your massage, and then hopefully we can get her in for the next thing."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I have been kind of tense lately.
Ben Wyatt,Just thinking about the new Star Wars sequel.
Ben Wyatt,I'm afraid they're gonna rely too heavily on CGI.
Ben Wyatt,And I'm carrying it all in my shoulders.
Extra,Just you?
Extra,You paid for a couple.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh Larry, would you like to get a couples massage with me?"
Jerry Gergich,I would love to.
Tom Haverford,Are we sure we should do this?
Tom Haverford,"Last time we scared an old person, Larry had a heart attack."
Andy Dwyer,That was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,He farted so much.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, look, obviously, we don't really know these people, so let's keep things fun and positive and celebratory, and mergery."
Rosie DeMarco,Can I help you?
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Mrs. DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day."
Doug DeMarco,All right.
Doug DeMarco,How much money did we win?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, you didn't win any money, you won something better than money."
Leslie Knope,A golden anniversary celebration.
Rosie DeMarco,So no money.
Leslie Knope,"No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check is."
Tom Haverford,Told you.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, you did, Tom."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Now is not the time.
Leslie Knope,We-- Hey!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,We'll give you some money.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Here, here's some money."
Leslie Knope,Everybody give 'em money.
Andy Dwyer,"I got football cards, and a travel mouthwash."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,That's great!
Leslie Knope,Let's get started!
Donna Meagle,Just give me the IP address of the dude that gave me that cracked-out Yelp review.
Extra,"Okay, here we go."
Extra,The IP address says it came from someone inside city hall.
Donna Meagle,In this building?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, no."
April Ludgate,"Well, who cares, really?"
April Ludgate,It's just some dumb internet person.
April Ludgate,Ignore it.
Donna Meagle,Ignore it?
Donna Meagle,I'm about to come down on this dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.
Donna Meagle,I'm about to go Mjolnir on his ass!
Ron Swanson,Speaking of bad reviews…
Ron Swanson,"Computers are mostly pointless, but that Yelp thing gave me a great idea on how to criticize people and places."
Ron Swanson,"I am composing strongly worded letters about things I disapprove of, and I am using the internet to get addresses where I can send them."
Ron Swanson,"So far I've written to a vegetable farm, several European ambassadors, a manufacturer of male cologne, and a nonfat frozen yogurt bar."
Ron Swanson,"""Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts."""
Ron Swanson,"""Be ice cream or be nothing."""
Ron Swanson,"""Zero stars."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I cannot wait for Leslie to see this surprise."
Ben Wyatt,I am so prepared.
Ben Wyatt,I watched Enchanted three times to get all the details right.
Ben Wyatt,"And then another two times, because that movie is amazing."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, it really is."
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hey, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt,You want to go grab lunch together?
Ben Wyatt,I'm out front.
Ben Wyatt,Super casual.
Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, babe."
Leslie Knope,I'm not even in my office.
Leslie Knope,I'm out saving the merger.
Leslie Knope,Can it wait?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Ben Wyatt,No worries.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, great."
Leslie Knope,I'll see you at dinner.
Leslie Knope,I love you.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, it's not too late to cancel the waffle buffet or the Hilary impersonator, but a lot of these deposits were non-refundable."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,You up for a boys' day out in a horsedrawn carriage?
Jerry Gergich,Sure.
Jerry Gergich,What the heck?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, thus begins our enchanted adventure."
Ben Wyatt,"God, that movie really was amazing."
Ben Wyatt,And you know what doesn't get enough credit in that movie?
Ben Wyatt,The score.
Jerry Gergich,Music.
Ben Wyatt,"Good sir, tally ho."
Jerry Gergich,"God, that-- from the movie!"
Ben Wyatt,That is definitely from the movie.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you two, head on up there."
Leslie Knope,We are gonna recreate your wedding photo from 50 years ago.
Doug DeMarco,"Okay, let's relive that day."
Doug DeMarco,Only this time could we shave her moustache?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm kind of worried about putting these two on live TV.
Leslie Knope,They're sort of grumpy.
Tom Haverford,Why are we wasting our time with these old people anyway?
Tom Haverford,They're like the old version of iTunes.
Tom Haverford,"We're like the new version of iTunes, baby."
Tom Haverford,We're gonna be here forever.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna die someday.
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's just hope that deep down these two still love each other."
Rosie DeMarco,"Hey, no touching."
Rosie DeMarco,This is not your birthday.
Jerry Gergich,"Now, you see, the trick with paella is to use just enough saffron  to complement the shellfish."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man, that is so good."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, isn't this exciting?"
Leslie Knope,"In just a few minutes, you are going to be professing your love on television."
Doug DeMarco,Could I have a glass of water before we go on?
Rosie DeMarco,Don't give him any water.
Rosie DeMarco,"He does this annoying thing where every time he takes a drink of water he goes, ""Ah"""
Doug DeMarco,She does this annoying thing where every time she takes a drink of water she is an old nag.
Leslie Knope,"Ah, the playful banter of a couple on the same team."
Leslie Knope,"That's what this is, right?"
Joan Callamezzo,"All right, let's burn this candle."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, if we could just have a moment."
Leslie Knope,We need to get ready.
Joan Callamezzo,"Oh, no, no."
Joan Callamezzo,We gotta go.
Joan Callamezzo,"Yeah, the uppers are kicking in."
Joan Callamezzo,"Just took some ludes to kind of smooth it out, so I'm right in that sweet spot."
Joan Callamezzo,"Got about 20 minutes before I either get really tired or really horny, so let's roll."
Rosie DeMarco,"Dougie, are you sure you want to go on television?"
Rosie DeMarco,You look like a leather glove got caught in a lawnmower.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,I'm going to admit something.
Leslie Knope,"I orchestrated the Pawnee Eagleton merger, and I was hoping that your marriage could show people that a happy union is possible."
Leslie Knope,"So when you're out there, if you could just, you know, look back over the past 50 years together and focus on the good times, okay?"
Kyle,"Donna, you wanted to see me?"
Donna Meagle,"Yes, I did, troll."
Kyle,What?
Donna Meagle,"You tried to adopt a cat last week and I turned you down, because I thought it was too sad for you to have six cats."
Donna Meagle,Then you tried to blow up my spot online.
Donna Meagle,You're fired.
Kyle,"You're not my boss, I work for the city attorney's office."
Donna Meagle,You're fired.
Ron Swanson,How much postage does it take to send a letter to Canada?
April Ludgate,Who's it going to?
Ron Swanson,Canada.
Ron Swanson,"It says, ""Dear Canada, [bleep] you."""
Joan Callamezzo,"Doug and Rosie DeMarco,"
Doug DeMarco,Ahh.
Joan Callamezzo,Tell us how you first met.
Rosie DeMarco,"Well, it was 1963, and we met, and it was great."
Leslie Knope,Isn't love grand?
Leslie Knope,"50 years of marriage, helping to bridge the meaningless divide between Pawnee and Eagleton."
Joan Callamezzo,"Yeah, my show, my questions."
Joan Callamezzo,So what is the secret sauce that we should all be putting on our marriage burgers?
Doug DeMarco,"Well, we never go to bed angry."
Joan Callamezzo,"Never, ever would have thought of that."
Doug DeMarco,Ahh.
Rosie DeMarco,Okay.
Rosie DeMarco,I can't do this.
Rosie DeMarco,"Leslie, you can keep your money."
Joan Callamezzo,Money?
Joan Callamezzo,Did you bribe them to be here?
Leslie Knope,"No, I--"
Doug DeMarco,Leslie offered us each 200 bucks to keep this going…
Joan Callamezzo,Ahh.
Doug DeMarco,But it's impossible.
Rosie DeMarco,You want to know why we got married?
Joan Callamezzo,Bring it.
Rosie DeMarco,"I had no prospects, and Dougie here had an alcohol problem."
Rosie DeMarco,"Plus the Cold War was happening, and frankly, we all thought we were gonna die."
Doug DeMarco,"Well, I figured I could really tick off my parents by shacking up with some Pawnee trash."
Leslie Knope,Ya-ta-ta-ta-ta.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"We all agree that marriages have their ups and downs, but at the end of the day, they're worth it because…"
Leslie Knope,Who likes tap dancing?
Doug DeMarco,I slept with Sharon in 1979.
Rosie DeMarco,I used to get out of the shower in front of your brother on purpose.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Leslie, who cares?"
Andy Dwyer,They're old people.
Andy Dwyer,"They eat, they sleep, they complain, and they watch Family Feud."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, I wanna be an old person."
Leslie Knope,"Gah, I don't know what to do."
Leslie Knope,I wish Ben was here.
Leslie Knope,What is he doing right now?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man!"
Jerry Gergich,You did good!
Ben Wyatt,Larry!
Jerry Gergich,Whoa!
Jerry Gergich,Wow.
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Extra,"Yeah, I own Lettuce Eat, the vegan restaurant on Lowell Drive, and I wanted to know why you nailed this letter to my door."
Ron Swanson,"""Veganism is the sad result of a morally corrupt mind."""
Ron Swanson,"""Reconsider your life."""
Ron Swanson,Because I believe it.
Ron Swanson,Good day.
Extra,Carnivores.
Extra,You're all the same.
April Ludgate,How did that guy know where to find you?
Ron Swanson,I assume he saw my name and address at the bottom of the letter I nailed to his door.
April Ludgate,You signed your real name?
Ron Swanson,Of course I did.
Ron Swanson,What's gonna happen?
Ron Swanson,A vegan is gonna physically attack me?
Ron Swanson,They're basically made of glass.
Ron Swanson,"But more importantly, if you believe in something, you sign your name to it."
Ron Swanson,Which is why the makers of carbonated water will soon know exactly where to find me.
April Ludgate,"Donna, Kyle did not write those things, okay?"
April Ludgate,I did.
Donna Meagle,I know.
April Ludgate,You do?
Donna Meagle,I checked what else that user had written.
Donna Meagle,"It was a review of a funeral home that said ""Great first date spot."""
Donna Meagle,I dragged Kyle in here to see if you would come clean.
April Ludgate,"Well, you overestimated how much I care what happens to Kyle."
April Ludgate,"Or anyone, really."
April Ludgate,But I'm sorry that I didn't just talk to you.
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry I bailed on work.
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry I toyed with you instead of coming at you straight.
Donna Meagle,"From now on, we say what we feel."
Donna Meagle,Cool?
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Your lipstick looks weird.
Donna Meagle,You're gonna want to shut your mouth right now.
April Ludgate,Good talk.
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians aren't meant to coexist.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, at least our merger is going well."
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Ben Wyatt,Cheers.
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Andy and Tom were right when they said the DeMarcos don't matter."
Ben Wyatt,Their generation's the past.
Ben Wyatt,The way to make this merger take hold is to focus on the future.
Leslie Knope, Of course.
Leslie Knope, The children.
Leslie Knope, The children are our future.
Leslie Knope," Whitney Houston knew it, and so do you, and so do I."
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna need your help on something.
Leslie Knope,I think we should go to work
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Leslie Knope, But not now.
Leslie Knope, We're having dinner.
Leslie Knope," Damn, this paella is good."
Leslie Knope, Did you put saffron in here? It makes the shellfish taste delicious.
Ben Wyatt, Yes.
Ben Wyatt," Yes, it does."
Leslie Knope," Okay, the people in this room are the first members of the Pawnee Eagleton Youth Committee."
Leslie Knope," Now, April says that young people think the word ""committee"" is lame, so let's just think of this as a like a super chill, fun e-hangout."
Tom Haverford, Worse.
Tom Haverford, That's worse.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, new people."
Ben Wyatt, Let's introduce ourselves.
Craig Middlebrooks, Craig Middlebrooks.
Craig Middlebrooks," Samantha in the boardroom, Miranda in the bedroom."
Craig Middlebrooks," I know it's not ideal, but it's who I am."
Craig Middlebrooks, This is my friend Madison.
Craig Middlebrooks, She's amazing.
Craig Middlebrooks, And she drove me here!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt, This group has an incredibly important job.
Ben Wyatt, You need to figure out how to hold this town together.
Leslie Knope," You are going to meet twice a week and you're here because of your energy, and your youth, and for some of you, your mental age, and you're going to find a way to make this merger stick."
Leslie Knope, So we are gonna order you some 'zzas.
Leslie Knope," You get to B.S.-ing, brainstorming."
Ben Wyatt, Just chill.
Ben Wyatt, Peace out.
Leslie Knope," Okay, so it's been an hour."
Leslie Knope," From out there, it looks like you guys were having some fun, getting to know each other."
Leslie Knope, So why don't we call this first meeting a success and then we'll get together later in the week.
Tom Haverford," Hold up, sweet pea."
Tom Haverford, We have an idea.
Tom Haverford, It's called the Unity Concert.
Tom Haverford, It's a massive music and arts festival to celebrate the merger.
Andy Dwyer, We get artists and musicians from both towns to come together.
Andy Dwyer," It's gonna be like a giant Woodstock, except for instead of everybody rolling around in mud, they'll be rolling around in happiness."
Andy Dwyer, Or maybe mud.
Andy Dwyer, I don't know.
Andy Dwyer, I can't control the weather.
Madison, We want to have a bunch of different band stages.
Madison," You know, people will go to parts of the town they don't usually go to."
Madison," Plus, we'll have tents for art exhibits and panels, and maybe a short film festival."
Tom Haverford, Donna said she might be able to get Ginuwine.
Tom Haverford, That's given me a reason to live.
April Ludgate," Yeah, it's not like everyone's gonna suddenly start holding hands and making out, but we figure, why not throw a big three-day outdoor party, show everyone a good time, and maybe they'll forget about this stupid stuff."
Tom Haverford, What do you think?
Leslie Knope,I don't-- I don't-- I don't even-- You know what I mean?
Madison,What's wrong with her? Why is making those noises?
April Ludgate,"Oh, right, you don't know Leslie."
April Ludgate, That means she loves it so much she can't speak.
Leslie Knope," You guys, that's like-- I don't know-- Amazing."
Leslie Knope, Like-- what you do there.
Ben Wyatt, Happy anniversary.
Ben Wyatt, So I know we agreed on no gifts.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,But I did get you a gift.
Leslie Knope,No.
Ben Wyatt,"A bunch of them, actually."
Ben Wyatt," I was gonna surprise you with them yesterday, but they never reached you."
Leslie Knope, Ahem.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my eff-ing God."
Leslie Knope, You planned all of this for me? An enchanted carriage? This is amazing.
Leslie Knope," Oh, and your scrapbook instincts are really good."
Leslie Knope," I mean, this is a little rough, but you have a lot of talent here."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, I can't believe I actually defeated Leslie Knope at a gift exchange."
Ben Wyatt,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Uh, yeah."
Leslie Knope, About that.
Leslie Knope, Happy anniversary.
Ben Wyatt, It's the Iron Throne.
Ben Wyatt, Ohh!
Ben Wyatt,It's the Iron Throne.
Leslie Knope," Yes, it is."
Leslie Knope, I had a guy at the model store make a replica.
Leslie Knope, He's a bigger Game of Thrones fan than you are.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, I know I'm making that dumb surprise face, but I can't help it."
Ben Wyatt," This is the greatest gift I've ever received, Leslie."
Ben Wyatt," When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die."
Ben Wyatt, Yes.
Ben Wyatt, No.
Ben Wyatt, Yes.
Ben Wyatt, No!
Ben Wyatt,Come here.
Ben Wyatt," Come hither, peasant."
Ben Wyatt, Come here.
Ben Wyatt, Who are you?
Leslie Knope,Our starship is in trouble.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, Leslie, listen."
Ben Wyatt, If you're not-- if you don't know what you're talking about

Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ron."
Leslie Knope,Enough's enough.
Leslie Knope,Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.
Ron Swanson,"Dear God, woman."
Leslie Knope,"Three main activities: baby bingo, baby food tasting, and my personal favorite baby onesie decorating station."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make mine look like an astronaut.
Leslie Knope,"What are you doing up there in space, baby?"
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,So cute!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I have some gift ideas.
Leslie Knope,I was looking at a very adorable stroller.
Ron Swanson,We already have a stroller.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, shoot."
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna have to think of something else.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, whose baby is that?"
Ron Swanson,That would be mine.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, get in here!"
Leslie Knope,Ron has a baby!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Ron, cool baby."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,"Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my son, John middle name redacted Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"John was born some time ago, weighing multiple pounds and several ounces."
Ron Swanson,"Much like his father, he is a fan of silence."
Ron Swanson,Please keep your voices down.
Leslie Knope,"How am I supposed to keep my voice down when you had your baby, and you didn't tell me that you had your baby?"
Ron Swanson,Why would you need to know something like that?
Leslie Knope,"Why would I-- oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,I have not even sent Diane a gift.
Leslie Knope,"She's just walking around, wondering why I haven't sent her a gift yet."
April Ludgate,Should we do something?
Ron Swanson,Just let her tire herself out.
Jerry Gergich,"If you need anything from us, Ron, please just let us know."
Ron Swanson,Actually there is something.
Ron Swanson,Could one of you please stop by the pet store and pick up some fish food for me?
Leslie Knope,When did you get a fish?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, youth committee."
Leslie Knope,Update on the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Madison.
Madison,"So far, 12 bands have said yes."
Madison,And we asked them all to submit a song for the new town anthem contest.
April Ludgate,I think we should book Orin as a headliner.
April Ludgate,I think it's a no-brainer.
April Ludgate,"Um, he dislocates his shoulder to the music of Billy Joel."
April Ludgate,"The Pawnee Journal called it, ""Why would anyone do this?"""
Leslie Knope,Stop suggesting Orin.
Leslie Knope,"Craig, any update on the art tents?"
Craig Middlebrooks,14 local artists signed up to show their work.
Craig Middlebrooks,"It was going to be 15, but then this one guy described himself as ""Jackson Pollockesque"" and I told him that's finger painting for adults and I hate it!"
Leslie Knope,"The Pawnee Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town."
Leslie Knope,"But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerate slash ignore me."
Leslie Knope,"I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario."
Leslie Knope,You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.
Leslie Knope,I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.
Leslie Knope,No one knows who that is?
Andy Dwyer,"Um, I do."
Andy Dwyer,"""Grant Larson,"" otherwise known as Elton John."
Andy Dwyer,"Congratulations, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"No, Grant Larson is the director of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,He's basically the Liam Bonneville of the Midwest.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville?
Leslie Knope,The department of the interior's resident bad boy?
Leslie Knope,"He's basically the Tim Dweck-- Okay, never mind."
Leslie Knope,I have asked Grant to declare Eagleton Hills a national park as the grand finale of our unity concert.
Andy Dwyer,"Great idea, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"And with that update, the Pawnee new founder's day unity concert is now officially ahead of schedule!"
Leslie Knope,And that banner unfurling marks the 100th time that one of my projects has been ahead of schedule.
Tom Haverford,"This is your chance to put your names on the Pawnee unity concert, the biggest event of 2014 besides the unveiling of Tricia's new highlights."
Tom Haverford,You think I wouldn't notice?
Tom Haverford,"You look fly as hell, girl!"
Tom Haverford,"This unity concert needs corporate sponsorship, so Ben and I are meeting with local bigwigs."
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna do what I do best-- lock down deals.
Tom Haverford,And dorkasaurus over here is gonna handle the boring stuff.
Ben Wyatt,You said you genuinely valued my business acumen.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm your boss."
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, he's so cute."
Donna Meagle,You're the cutest little boobear I've ever seen.
Craig Middlebrooks,You are the world's most adorable baby and I love you!
Craig Middlebrooks,You are so freaking precious!
Jerry Gergich,Look what Gayle made for the baby.
Jerry Gergich,"It says ""Property of Pawnee government."""
Jerry Gergich,Isn't that adorable?
Ron Swanson,"Come on, John."
Donna Meagle,Jeez.
Leslie Knope,Here we are the park that borders Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,This is the perfect place for the press conference to announce our unity concert.
Leslie Knope,"People are gonna clap, they're gonna cheer."
Leslie Knope,Today might be the day that I finally crowd surf.
Leslie Knope,I should probably empty my pockets just in case.
April Ludgate,"Hey, one question."
April Ludgate,"Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says ""Pawnee, you suck,"" or ""Go home, Eagleton snobs""?"
Leslie Knope,I painted over that graffiti a week ago.
Leslie Knope,These people are the worst!
Leslie Knope,I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it."
Leslie Knope,"You know, why do we even have this wall?"
Leslie Knope,"We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them."
Leslie Knope,We should just knock it down.
Andy Dwyer,"On it, boss."
Andy Dwyer,Ahh!
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,The kool-aid guy makes it look so easy.
Ron Swanson,"In the time I've worked here, I've taken great pains to see as little of this building as possible."
Ron Swanson,"Turns out the third floor is silent, empty, and completely free of government work."
Ron Swanson,I can't think of anything more beautiful to share with my son.
Ron Swanson,If I had a toolbox I could take care of that faulty radiator.
Ron Swanson,Ooh!
Ron Swanson,This place is a paradise!
Ben Wyatt,"Nicely done, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,We have 15 sponsorship offers.
Mitch Savner,Make that 16.
Mitch Savner,Mitch Savner.
Tom Haverford,Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!
Mitch Savner,That's it.
Tom Haverford,You guys make my favorite teeth whitening strips pearlies for girlies.
Tom Haverford,It's unisex.
Tom Haverford,The cartoon princess on the label says so.
Mitch Savner,I'll sponsor your concert.
Mitch Savner,But I'm also looking to invest in other ventures.
Mitch Savner,I have a feeling a bright guy like you has some ideas of his own.
Tom Haverford,I may have a few eggs ready to hatch in the personal idea nest.
Mitch Savner,Why don't you come to my office tomorrow and pitch me your hottest idea?
Tom Haverford,Perfect!
Tom Haverford,I'll see you then.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, that's pretty cool."
Tom Haverford,"It's all happening, Ben."
Tom Haverford,"Soon I'll have a new career, new crib, new friends."
Tom Haverford,"If all goes well, this may be one of the last times I ever have to speak to you."
Tom Haverford,"Come with me, I need your help."
Leslie Knope,"Thank you so much, everyone, for coming."
Leslie Knope,And a special thank you to the city council for their support.
Jeremy Jamm,I was told there'd be a free barbecue buffet?
Leslie Knope,Just take some beef jerky and hush!
Leslie Knope,This spring we will be holding a massive unity concert to commemorate the merger between Pawnee and Eagleton.
Leslie Knope,"This three day music and arts festival will end on a day we will call ""New Founder's Day,"" an official beginning to our new town."
Leslie Knope,"A few years ago, Eagleton put up this wall along the border."
Leslie Knope,Now it is time to tear down this wall.
Leslie Knope,"In the name of unity, I have given some former Eagletonians the first strike."
Leslie Knope,"Take it away, guys."
Leslie Knope,This is such a great day for--
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,Bees!
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Nobody panic!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Ohhh, noooo!"
Extra,Ah!
Extra,It stung me in the eyeball!
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, man, this is amazing, man."
Jeremy Jamm,The stupid Eagletonians are totally getting the pwned by these bees.
Jeremy Jamm,I'm gonna send this straight to tosh.
Jeremy Jamm,"Ow, [bleep]!"
Jeremy Jamm,[Bleep]!
Andy Dwyer,"Don't worry, babe, I'll protect you."
Andy Dwyer,"I got stung once, I'm immune."
Andy Dwyer,"Go ahead and sting me, bees."
Andy Dwyer,It does nothing.
Extra,"Leslie, it appears that most of the people that were stung were from Eagleton."
Extra,How did you pull that off?
Leslie Knope,I didn't pull anything off.
Leslie Knope,The Eagletonians were simply closest to the wall.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, one Pawneean was stung in his mouth because he was laughing at the Eagletonians."
Extra,"How did you get your bees into the wall, and how long did it take to plan this hilarious bee prank on Eagleton?"
Leslie Knope,"They were not my bees, Trodd."
Leslie Knope,And for the last time this was not a prank.
Leslie Knope,I did not know that bees were in that wall.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, in fact you should treat this like a public service announcement."
Leslie Knope,Everybody… should check their walls for bees.
Extra,"Nice try, prank queen."
Extra,Probably bees in there.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's all the time I have."
Extra,What else can you do with your bees?
Extra,"Leslie, what's your next prank?"
Jerry Gergich,Ooh.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, Grant Larson is on the phone from the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,I cannot meet with him right now.
Leslie Knope,"We are in crisis mode, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"Larry, just tell him I need to reschedule because I am trying to fix my bee hole disaster."
Jerry Gergich,Okeydokey.
Leslie Knope,Wait!
Leslie Knope,"No, wait!"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Larry, don't tell him that."
Leslie Knope,Don't mention my bee hole.
Ron Swanson,"Just as we suspected, John."
Ron Swanson,"We repaired the valve stem seal, and now all that remains is to tighten down this packing nut."
Ron Swanson,And… that should do it.
Extra,Can we help you?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,We have everything under control.
Extra,My crew's redoing this whole floor.
Extra,We're the only people allowed up here right now.
Ron Swanson,"Well, proceed with your work."
Ron Swanson,You won't notice us at all.
Extra,We're gonna be kinda loud.
Ron Swanson,My son is several weeks old.
Ron Swanson,He's quite familiar with the sound of power tools.
Tom Haverford,"Okay, how about this one Lasik for fingernails?"
Tom Haverford,"Cut your fingernails once, never have to cut 'em again."
Tom Haverford,All we need is a complicated laser I have no idea how to build.
Ben Wyatt,Seems impossible.
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,Uh-oh!
Tom Haverford,"""Saltweens."""
Tom Haverford,Saltines for tweens.
Ben Wyatt,Seems unnecessary?
Tom Haverford,The only business idea I have that's even remotely fleshed out is a restaurant.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Ben Wyatt,"Restaurants were ranked number one in Accounting Magazine's ""Riskiest Businesses"" issue."
Ben Wyatt,"That was their last issue before they folded, actually."
Ben Wyatt,Magazines are also very risky.
Tom Haverford,"I can't believe an angel investor floated down from the heavens, and I don't even have anything to pitch him."
Tom Haverford,"Come on, you must've had one good business idea."
Tom Haverford,You're 52 years old!
Ben Wyatt,"No, I'm not."
Ben Wyatt,But I do have an idea.
Ben Wyatt,It's air-tight.
Ben Wyatt,"But I have to warn you, it's not super sexy."
Tom Haverford,What is it?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, listen up."
Ben Wyatt,You would be the middleman between dry cleaners and the companies that sell chemicals to dry cleaners.
Tom Haverford,Wow!
Ben Wyatt,Right?
Tom Haverford,"You're right, man."
Tom Haverford,That is not sexy.
Mike Patterson,Leslie Knope's little stunt put three people in the hospital.
Mike Patterson,This bee incident is just the latest assault coming from the Pawnee side of this merger.
Craig Middlebrooks,Mike Patterson is Eagleton's most tenacious reporter.
Craig Middlebrooks,"When he sinks his teeth into something, he's like a dog with a bone!"
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God!"
April Ludgate,You can't lean in to whisper and then yell.
April Ludgate,That's not fair.
Leslie Knope,"This merger is so fragile, everyone is on edge, and no one is talking about the unity concert."
Leslie Knope,Why would anybody think that was a prank?
Andy Dwyer,So sad.
Andy Dwyer,People will believe anything.
Andy Dwyer,"It was a prank though, right?"
April Ludgate,"No more press, okay?"
April Ludgate,You just have to lay low for a while.
April Ludgate,I promise it'll all blow over.
Leslie Knope,"April, your competence and your levelheadedness is very moving to me, and I will follow your advice right after I go to the hospital and apologize to every victim in person."
April Ludgate,"Fine, but no cameras."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I won't bring any."
Craig Middlebrooks,Aghh!
Craig Middlebrooks,I can't handle all this fighting.
Craig Middlebrooks,It's like Thanksgiving 2004 all over again!
Craig Middlebrooks,Don't even ask!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Somebody follow me, I'm distraught!"
Extra,Who's a big guy?
Extra,"Man, forget about working."
Extra,I just wanna stare at this baby all day.
Ron Swanson,What is the nature of your work on this floor?
Extra,"Total redo-- new floors, fixtures, plumbing."
Ron Swanson,How long will it take?
Extra,Six to eight weeks.
Ron Swanson,Deal.
Ron Swanson,I will do all this work for you in the time allotted.
Ron Swanson,Just have your tools and materials brought up here.
Extra,Are you crazy?
Extra,This is enough work for a whole crew.
Ron Swanson,"I'm sure the government believed you when you told them that, and I tip my cap to you for profiting off their ignorance."
Ron Swanson,"But I'm offering you two months paid vacation and the ability to take credit for my work, which will be flawless."
Extra,Okay.
Extra,"Guys, let's go!"
Ron Swanson,I got all help I'll need right here.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is the really exciting part."
Ben Wyatt,"We buy tetrachloroethylene at 1.60 a gallon, but we sell it back at 2.38 a gallon."
Ben Wyatt,Now I know what you're thinking.
Ben Wyatt,What if it's a cleaner who wants to buy glycol ethers?
Tom Haverford,"Ben, stop!"
Tom Haverford,This is so boring!
Tom Haverford,This is like listening to a TED talk by the color beige.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I know this idea doesn't excite you."
Ben Wyatt,But I promise it'll make you a lot of money.
Tom Haverford,"Well, I sold tons of awesome stuff."
Tom Haverford,Guess it makes sense my next challenge is to sell something mind-numbingly dull.
Ben Wyatt,Dull?
Ben Wyatt,Does this look dull to you?
Tom Haverford,Ahhhh.
Leslie Knope,I'm so incredibly sorry.
Extra,"That's very kind of you, Ms. Knope."
Leslie Knope,I hope you look a lot less gross very soon.
Jeremy Jamm,Hey!
Jeremy Jamm,"Thanks for coming, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,I knew we were besties.
Jeremy Jamm,"What do you got in there for me, some dirty mags?"
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,These gift baskets are for innocent victims not for jerks who got stung because they were laughing at other people's pain.
Jeremy Jamm,Whatever.
Jeremy Jamm,Got a lotta filth in my kindle anyway.
Jeremy Jamm,We can just hang.
Jeremy Jamm,Wanna come up?
Leslie Knope,What?
Mike Patterson,We gotta get this.
Extra,Roll camera.
Mike Patterson,Tell me when.
Mike Patterson,Is my hair okay?
Mike Patterson,We good?
Mike Patterson,"Welcome to Eagleton Now, with Mike Patterson."
Mike Patterson,"We're live ambushing Leslie Knope who's in the middle of a crass publicity stunt, shoving cameras cameras into the faces of these poor, injured victims."
Leslie Knope,These are your cameras.
Leslie Knope,This is not a publicity stunt.
Leslie Knope,I just came here by myself to apologize to all the Eagletonians who got stung.
Mike Patterson,Really?
Mike Patterson,"Because all we see is you talking to your friend, known Eagleton hater Jeremy Jamm."
Jeremy Jamm,"Excuse me, Mike."
Jeremy Jamm,"That's, uh, best friend."
Leslie Knope,Pawneeans and Eagletonians need to find a way to come together and bury the hatchet.
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter who bailed out who, or who seceded from you."
Jeremy Jamm,"Awesome idea, Lezzie."
Jeremy Jamm,As a matter of fact I say we should secede from Eagleton!
Jeremy Jamm,Whose dumbass idea was it for them to merge anyway?
Leslie Knope,Mine.
Leslie Knope,It was my idea.
Mike Patterson,You heard it here first.
Mike Patterson,Self-proclaimed dumbass Leslie Knope and councilman Jeremy Jamm are spearheading a Pawnee secession movement.
Mike Patterson,"And I, for one, am sick of it."
Jeremy Jamm,"All right, you know what, Eagleton, enough!"
Jeremy Jamm,Get these cameras outta here!
Extra,"Don't touch my camera, you Pawnee animal!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Namecalling, huh?"
Jeremy Jamm,"Classy move, douche bag."
Mike Patterson,Oh!
Mike Patterson,All right.
Mike Patterson,Is that how you wanna play?
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah!
Jeremy Jamm,Come on!
Leslie Knope,No fighting in a hospital.
Leslie Knope,There shouldn't be fighting in a hospital!
Jeremy Jamm,Wish I had my ninja stars!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Mother… puncher!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, girl."
Leslie Knope,What up?
April Ludgate,What are you wearing?
Leslie Knope,It's to distract people from my black eye.
Leslie Knope,See?
Leslie Knope,It's working.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,"Um well, there is some good news."
April Ludgate,"That Mike Patterson guy's show just aired, everyone is angry, and Jamm is introducing a secession bill at the next city council meeting."
Leslie Knope,How is any of that good news?
April Ludgate,It's not.
April Ludgate,I just wanted you to have a brief moment of happiness before you got sadder.
April Ludgate,Those jerks that hate the merger are a minority.
April Ludgate,They're just shouting louder than everyone else.
April Ludgate,I'm sorry this town keeps being stupid and letting you down.
April Ludgate,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"It's okay, April."
Leslie Knope,It's fine.
Leslie Knope,"You know, it's a challenge."
Leslie Knope,"It's just like a big, fun... stinking turd nugget."
Leslie Knope,It sucks.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, everything sucks."
Leslie Knope,Everything I try with this merger backfires.
Leslie Knope,I wonder what other excellent surprise lies in store for Leslie Knope.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, Grant Larson from the National Park Service is here for your meeting."
Leslie Knope,Excellent.
Leslie Knope,Now I shall meet with a very important person whilst sporting a gruesome shiner.
April Ludgate,"Hey, you're also wearing a tie-dye tshirt."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes!"
Leslie Knope,I am!
Leslie Knope,Wonderful!
Tom Haverford,Mitch!
Tom Haverford,Thanks for meeting me.
Mitch Savner,My pleasure.
Mitch Savner,It's not often that I see someone with your sparkle and passion.
Mitch Savner,That's what makes businesses work-- passion!
Mitch Savner," So Mr. Haverford, let's get to it."
Mitch Savner, What idea are you passionate about?
Tom Haverford,"I've got two words for you-- ""Tom's Bistro,"" an old-fashioned, old-world Italian restaurant."
Tom Haverford," Classy, authentic ambience in a small-town setting."
Mitch Savner," Why does that say ""dry cleaning chemical transactional holding company?"""
Tom Haverford,Ben! You brought the wrong easel.
Tom Haverford, God! Can't take this guy anywhere.
Tom Haverford, Let me paint you a picture.
Leslie Knope," Oh, Mr. Larson, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope, I had to reschedule.
Leslie Knope, It's been kind of a hectic week.
Grant Larson,What happened to your face?
Leslie Knope,It doesn't matter.
Leslie Knope, I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.
Grant Larson,"I read your request, Ms. Knope, and I'm sorry, but we can't make that happen."
Leslie Knope, Great.
Leslie Knope," Well, this week just keeps getting better and better."
Leslie Knope, Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse.
Grant Larson, I came here because I wanted to meet you.
Grant Larson, I've actually wanted to meet you since before you called me.
Leslie Knope,Really? You know who I am?
Grant Larson,Yes.
Grant Larson, You're the person who wrote this.
Leslie Knope, You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river? I wrote this two years ago.
Grant Larson, Got shuffled around in interior for a year and half.
Grant Larson," Liam Bonneville actually used it to humiliate staffers, but he's kind of a bad boy."
Leslie Knope, Liam B-- You don't have to tell me!
Grant Larson,This report is legendary.
Grant Larson, It's easily the most thoroughly research and passionate grant request I've ever seen.
Leslie Knope," Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that."
Leslie Knope, But you're a little late.
Leslie Knope, The river cleanup's well underway.
Grant Larson, This is bigger than the river cleanup.
Grant Larson, We're opening a new office in Chicago.
Grant Larson, I spent the last few weeks reading about you and your career and I think that you're the perfect person to run it.
Grant Larson," Leslie, would you like to run a branch of the National Park Service?"
Tom Haverford,"Tom's Bistro will have all the classic elements, but with modern twists-- an oak bar, live music, and Sunday brunch with scrambled eggs so fluffy they'll be like little pillows for your bacon."
Mitch Savner, Bacon pillows.
Mitch Savner, I like the sound of that.
Mitch Savner," But I have to say, restaurants are incredibly risky."
Mitch Savner, Most of them are dead on arrival.
Ben Wyatt," We're well-aware of that, but believe me, Tom has thought this out."
Ben Wyatt," See, there's plenty of real estate available in the old Eagleton part of town."
Ben Wyatt," And with the recent closures, there's massive demand for affordable dining that feels high-end."
Mitch Savner," Okay! As long as you're running, I'm in."
Tom Haverford, Amazing!
Mitch Savner,"Hey, kid your boss here sure knows his stuff."
Leslie Knope, Ron.
Leslie Knope, What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,The most important government work I've ever done-- sanding rat urine stains out of this floor.
Ron Swanson, What are you doing here?
Leslie Knope,I come here to think sometimes.
Leslie Knope, By myself.
Leslie Knope,But now that you're here…
Ron Swanson,Damn it.
Leslie Knope," I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it."
Ron Swanson," That is my ideal conversation, aside from no conversation."
Ron Swanson, But that feels unlikely.
Leslie Knope," Look, you know how much I love Pawnee."
Leslie Knope, But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.
Leslie Knope," They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger."
Leslie Knope, They literally punch me in the face.
Leslie Knope," And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it."
Leslie Knope, What is wrong with me?
Ron Swanson,"Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator."
Ron Swanson," Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem."
Ron Swanson," This subpar toolbox only had one wrench, so I was lucky it was a three-quarters or I'd have been screwed."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, man, you are lucky."
Leslie Knope," Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope, What the hell? I need your help.
Ron Swanson," By the time I was done, this 100-year-old piece of American-made cast iron was singing like a bird."
Ron Swanson," Now, to most people, this story would seem boring."
Leslie Knope, That's ridiculous.
Leslie Knope, It's a story about a radiator.
Ron Swanson," But to me, it was immensely satisfying because I enjoy fixing radiators."
Ron Swanson," You like fixing this town, Leslie, you always have."
Ron Swanson," You know it's an uphill battle, but you love the struggle."
Ron Swanson," I would also add that you've already done a hell of a lot to make this town better, and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work."
Leslie Knope,He is a beautiful boy.
Ron Swanson,He's quite a looker.
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson, Clearing my throat.
Leslie Knope, I've been thinking about your offer.
Leslie Knope, And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it.
Grant Larson, That's great! I'll start drawing up the paperwork.
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it."
Grant Larson," Okay, wow, that's very misleading phraseology."
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope," It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me."
Leslie Knope, And I won't know until I finish what I've started.
Leslie Knope, When do you need your answer?
Grant Larson,"Well, the gears of federal government grind pretty slowly, so you have a little time."
Grant Larson, But we can't wait forever.
Grant Larson, I'll be in touch.
Leslie Knope, Great.
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope, That's not your hand.
Leslie Knope, Here it is.
Leslie Knope," Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up."
Ben Wyatt," Really happy that worked out for you, Tom, but you kinda sold me out back there."
Tom Haverford," I know, and I'm sorry."
Tom Haverford," But Mitch asked me what I was passionate about, and honestly I'm never gonna be passionate about dry cleaning chemicals."
Ben Wyatt," To each his own, I guess."
Tom Haverford," I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work."
Tom Haverford, I know I can!
Ben Wyatt,Then count me in as the second investor in Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford," Thanks, man."
Tom Haverford," I know this is a symbolic gesture, but my investor floor is $1,000."
Tom Haverford," So as of now, you own zero shares."
Ben Wyatt, Cool! Thanks for clearing that up.
Ben Wyatt," Now go do work, or I will fire you."
Ben Wyatt, I'm not kidding.
Tom Haverford, Yep!
Ron Swanson,"Oh, look, John."
Ron Swanson, It's red pine.
Ron Swanson, They were gonna put flecked linoleum over this beautifully preserved knotty red pine.
Ron Swanson," Most people in this world, John, are ass[bleep]."
Ron Swanson," This is the best day I've ever spent in a government building, and luckily my son was here to share it with me."
Ron Swanson, He now has that satisfied look that only comes with the pride of labor.
Ron Swanson, Or he pooped.
Ron Swanson," Either way, well done, John."

Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I don't want to over-hype this, but presenting Dun-da-da-dah!"
Ben Wyatt,the new city of Pawnee website!
Ben Wyatt,Totally revamped!
Leslie Knope,"You can pay parking tickets, you can apply for a business license and the best part is we're going to put up an online poll so people can pick the new town slogan!"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, look a panda!"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, that's just some mascot thing that the designer put up on the front page."
Ben Wyatt,"But more importantly, you can now apply for a utility tax refund… online!"
Donna Meagle,"Wait, the panda's name is Peebo."
April Ludgate,Peebo.
Jerry Gergich,"Look, you can even play pingpong."
Tom Haverford,What?
April Ludgate,I want to play!
Andy Dwyer,"No, me first!"
Andy Dwyer,Me first!
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm calling it.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, Ben worked really hard on this, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's look at the online polls.
Leslie Knope,It's gonna be a cool way to choose our new town's slogan.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,The panda holds a paddle with his tail.
Leslie Knope,I want to play!
Ron Swanson,"Congratulations, Ben."
Ron Swanson,This is truly a fine panda game you made.
Ron Swanson,Well done.
April Ludgate,What else does he do?
Ben Wyatt,"I think if you click on the bamboo, it puts on a top hat."
All,What?
Andy Dwyer,"I love you, Ben!"
Craig Middlebrooks,What's wrong with you?
Craig Middlebrooks,You look like Meryl Streep at the end of Ironweed.
Craig Middlebrooks,You wish.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, I've been driving all over Indiana looking for bands to play the unity concert."
Andy Dwyer,"I got nothing to show for, except for four car accidents."
Andy Dwyer,All these strangers' insurance information.
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I get it, you have car insurance."
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you brag about it?
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you are from Eagleton, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Are there any places out there I should check out?
Craig Middlebrooks,I used to go see live shows at Patterson's.
Craig Middlebrooks,But I'm boycotting until the owner apologizes for what she said to me at the dog park.
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Andy Dwyer,Anything else?
Craig Middlebrooks,I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty packed on Thursdays.
Craig Middlebrooks,But I've never been because it's mostly middle aged women and I'm allergic to turkey neck.
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,That's the best part.
Andy Dwyer,We should split a turkey sometime.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Mr. Larson."
Leslie Knope,Thank you so much for meeting me here.
Grant Larson,Happy to.
Grant Larson,I was in the area.
Grant Larson,The chance for me to return your binder full of questions about the job.
Grant Larson,I think I answered all of them.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,I cannot wait to check this out.
Leslie Knope,"Now, the reason why I asked you to meet me here"
Grant Larson,More questions about the job.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,Martha?
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna need two hours worth of waffles.
Leslie Knope,Grant Larson has offered me a chance to oversee a branch office of the national park service.
Leslie Knope,This is like the parks equivalent of Bruce Springsteen pulling Courtney Cox onstage.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, one minute you're just a regular girl in the crowd, and the next minute you're dancing 10 feet away from freakin' Max Weinberg!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project."
Leslie Knope,"Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?"
Leslie Knope,"Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot."
Grant Larson,"Well, you wouldn't actually be planting things."
Grant Larson,"I mean, you're overseeing 200 people."
Grant Larson,The everyday minutia you would delegate to staff.
Grant Larson,"Leslie, your job is more creative, big picture stuff."
Grant Larson,No more boring people working for you.
Leslie Knope,Good!
Leslie Knope,I hate paperwork.
Leslie Knope,I hardly ever do it in my bed on a Saturday night while listening to old spice girls CDs.
Tom Haverford,Regal Meagle.
Tom Haverford,My favorite realtor.
Tom Haverford,You got some hot properties to show me?
Donna Meagle,You know it.
Tom Haverford,"Remember my list of must haves: Open kitchen, fireplace, exposed brick, and you know I wouldn't kick a skylight out of bed."
Tom Haverford,"I'm opening Pawnee's first authentic Sinatra style Italian restaurant ""Tom's Bistro."""
Tom Haverford,"I'm kind of like a skinny, handsome, Indian Mario Batali who doesn't know how to cook."
Tom Haverford,"Before we go, I got you guys a little something for helping me out."
Donna Meagle,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Love it!
April Ludgate,A Larry voodoo doll?
April Ludgate,"Tom, that's so sweet."
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Jerry Gergich,Ow!
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh!"
April Ludgate,I didn't even do anything.
April Ludgate,The voodoo doll is reading my thoughts.
Ben Wyatt,"So it seems like it went really well, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, totally."
Leslie Knope,"Grant is great, the job is great."
Leslie Knope,The waffles were great.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,So we're just about ready to go live with the slogan poll.
Ben Wyatt,You want to see?
Leslie Knope,"Now that Eagleton and Pawnee have merged, it is time to pick a new town slogan."
Leslie Knope,And a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town's identity.
Leslie Knope,"There is New York, the city that never sleeps."
Leslie Knope,"And then there is Glenwater, Florida, home of America's most violent Walmart parking lot."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so people can vote now."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"No, we're not gonna do that."
Leslie Knope,We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.
Ben Wyatt,"Um, what?"
Leslie Knope,"There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben."
Leslie Knope,"We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass."
Leslie Knope,You know what we should do?
Leslie Knope,"We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I did."
Donna Meagle,So this was one of Eagleton's top sushi restaurants.
Donna Meagle,But you can't outrun the whale meat police forever.
Tom Haverford,This is great.
Tom Haverford,I love it!
Tom Haverford,"Look at it, I can picture it now."
Tom Haverford,"That's where the politicians will sit, this is where the connected guys will bring their goomahs."
Tom Haverford,This place is perfect.
Tom Haverford,How much?
Donna Meagle,"9,000 a month."
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,That's way more that I can afford.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,It's not that great.
April Ludgate,"Plus, it's really far away from work and that'd be annoying."
Tom Haverford,It's not a big deal.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, when it first launches I'll go back and forth, but hopefully it takes off and it'll become a full-time job."
Donna Meagle,"Come on, I'll show some places in your price range."
Leslie Knope,"This press junket is a brilliant idea, isn't it?"
Leslie Knope,Mr. Strange Cameraman Who I Never Met.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I told you, I'm not gonna participate in your weird Julia Roberts, cameraman husband fantasy."
Leslie Knope,"Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here."
Perd Hapley,"Leslie, your poll is designed to choose a new slogan."
Perd Hapley,And a slogan is a series of words that have a meaning.
Leslie Knope,"So true, Perd."
Leslie Knope,"All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be ""Storied past, bright future."""
Perd Hapley,"Well, the story of my interest level is: It's medium."
Leslie Knope,"Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newly merged city a new identity to really rebrand this town."
Joan Callamezzo,"Yes, great question."
Joan Callamezzo,I have been thinking of rebranding myself.
Joan Callamezzo,What do you think about Juan Callamezzo?
Leslie Knope,"Isn't ""Juan"" a man's name?"
Joan Callamezzo,"No, it means ""flower."""
Leslie Knope,"I think it means ""John."""
Crazy Ira,"Crazy Ira and the Douche from 93.7 FM, the Groove."
Crazy Ira,"Leslie, do you believe that this new slogan will integrate Pawnee and Eagleton into one cohesive city?"
Leslie Knope,"Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, yes, I do."
The Douche,"Followup question, Leslie, show us your boobs!"
Crazy Ira,Will this fit on a bumper sticker?
Andy Dwyer,"Gosh, this place is packed."
Andy Dwyer,You folks must really like this guy.
Extra,"Honey, he is sex on a stick."
Extra,"Ladies and gentlemen, put your jazzy hands together for my man, Mr. Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,A smooth and silky evening to you all.
Ron Swanson,"On nights like this, when the cold winds blow, and the air is awash in the swirling eddies of our dreams, come with me and find safe haven in a warm bathtub full of my jazz."
All,Uh!
Ben Wyatt,"Well, the good news is your poll was a big hit."
Ben Wyatt,Thousands of people voted.
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Leslie Knope,What's leading?
Leslie Knope,"""Storied past, bright future""?"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"The current leader is ""Pawnee, welcome to Douche nation."""
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Crazy Ira and the Douche got their bonehead radio fans to flood the poll with write-in votes.
Ben Wyatt,Why did we include a write-in option?
Leslie Knope,Because every election has a write-in option.
Leslie Knope,That's how democracy works.
Leslie Knope,I'm not a dictator.
Leslie Knope,"If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial."
Leslie Knope,"I would be a very strong dictator, and you would be my bodyguard, and you would lead my army."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I know we should figure out how to fix this."
Ben Wyatt,"But I'm starting to get kind of turned on imagining you as a dictator, is that bad?"
Leslie Knope,"No, it's okay."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, we could just figure out a different strategy for picking a slogan."
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to go on their show.
Leslie Knope,"No, I want to do this."
Leslie Knope,I enjoy the challenge.
Leslie Knope,"So, how do I look?"
Leslie Knope,"I need these guys to think that I'm, like, super chill."
Ben Wyatt,Is this gonna work?
The Douche,"Oh, what up, Lez?"
The Douche,Backwards hatshows a real lack of respect for authority.
The Douche,I like that.
The Douche,"What's up, little mayor?"
The Douche,Are you gonna freak out again?
Crazy Ira,"So, Leslie, what's the deal?"
Crazy Ira,Are you just here to yell at us again?
The Douche,"Yeah, we are in store for another Leslie Knope nag sesh?"
Extra,"Crazy Ira, do the dishes!"
Leslie Knope,Classic!
Leslie Knope,No way!
Leslie Knope,"I'm not here to nag, guys."
Leslie Knope,"I'm just psyched to be in the studio, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I'm just… chillin' in the studes with my dudes.
Crazy Ira,"If you're really not really here to nag us, then maybe you'll help us with our next segment ""Rating celebrities' boobs!"""
Leslie Knope,Perfect.
The Douche,"On a scale, from 1 to gagagagoing!"
The Douche,How would you rate Emma Watson's boobs?
Leslie Knope,"First of all, I would rate her acting as an ""A."""
The Douche,You have three seconds to answer or we're gonna withdraw  a donation from charity.
Leslie Knope,From charity?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,A minus.
Crazy Ira,More like double D minus.
Extra,Me so horny!
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Leslie Knope,I knew it.
Ron Swanson,Can I help you?
Andy Dwyer,Maybe.
Andy Dwyer,I was out at the jazz club last night scouting bands for the unity concert.
Andy Dwyer,And I saw something very interesting.
Ron Swanson,I am Duke Silver.
Andy Dwyer,You have a twin brother.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,I have a twin brother.
Andy Dwyer,You are Duke Silver?
Ron Swanson,"Yes, I am Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,The only other people who know are Tom and April.
Ron Swanson,"So, please, keep it to yourself."
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding me?
Andy Dwyer,You are really good!
Andy Dwyer,"You are, like, the saxophone player for the California raisins good."
Andy Dwyer,No joke.
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,I'm booking you for the unity concert.
Ron Swanson,Absolutely not.
Ron Swanson,My musical career is private.
Ron Swanson,"If my secret got out, this office would be waist deep in women's undergarments."
Andy Dwyer,"No, I'm in charge of booking the bands for the concert, and I say, you're in."
Andy Dwyer,You're gonna play right after Bobby knight ranger.
Andy Dwyer,It's a night ranger cover band where they only wear read sweaters.
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be epic!
Crazy Ira,"Final round, Leslie, boobs or ass?"
Leslie Knope,Hard to believe this is a fan game for your radio listeners.
Leslie Knope,Ah… I'm gonna say butt.
Extra,"Ding, ding, ding!"
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Crazy Ira,You are correct.
Crazy Ira,This is my mom's dumper!
Crazy Ira,"Oh, mommy!"
Leslie Knope,I don't know how you got yours hand on that.
The Douche,I took it.
Leslie Knope,Good.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it is been so fun broing out with my dogs."
Leslie Knope,I never knew that objectifying women could be so much fun.
The Douche,"We're running out of time here so just a quick reminder to write-in ""Welcome to Douche nation!"""
The Douche,As the official town slogan for pawneecity.gov.
Leslie Knope,Or you know what would also be kind of dope for the people of Douche nation to do?
Leslie Knope,It's vote for another slogan.
Leslie Knope,"Like, you know, ""Storied past, bright future""?"
Leslie Knope,But… I don't care.
Leslie Knope,"I don't give a fart, bros."
Leslie Knope,"You know, just do your thing, chicken wing."
The Douche,"Hey, Crazy Ira, have you seen my stick?"
Crazy Ira,Where's your stick?
The Douche,I don't know.
The Douche,"Lesbo Baggins, you know where my stick is?"
Leslie Knope,You--
The Douche,Oh!
The Douche,Found my stick.
Crazy Ira,"Oh, where did you find it?"
The Douche,Up Leslie Knope's butt!
Extra,"Yo, where my stick up?"
Extra,"It's up her butt, papi."
Crazy Ira,"Jewish Greg, whatever we're paying you, it's not enough."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, I almost pulled that off."
Ben Wyatt,"No, you really didn't."
Ben Wyatt,Just delete the poll.
Ben Wyatt,Let the slogan thing go.
Leslie Knope,"Or, maybe we sneak back in there you distract those guys for, like, 30, 90 minutes, I get on live radio, I give an impassioned speech about what slogan I want to endorse and I play a few songs, which I always wanted to do, and then we just see what happens."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I should just let this go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, what are you doing?"
Andy Dwyer,That looks like a perfectly good saxophone case.
Andy Dwyer,Wait a minute.
Andy Dwyer,What's inside that case?
Ron Swanson,I am ending my secret musical career.
Ron Swanson,I have to kill Duke Silver.
Andy Dwyer,"No, come on, man."
Andy Dwyer,You're really good.
Andy Dwyer,You can't quit.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,I would rather never play again than have everyone know my secret.
Ron Swanson,"Goodbye, Duke Silver."
Ron Swanson,May you rest… in jazz.
Leslie Knope,"So, Tom told you are sort of like a computer expert."
Morris,Uh… yeah.
Morris,You can say that.
Leslie Knope,"These jerks are trying to hijack my online poll, and so far the leading town slogan is, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt."""
Morris,"Yeah, yeah."
Morris,I voted for that one.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"I'm wondering, is there a way I can communicate with everybody who voted?"
Morris,"Yeah, I can do that."
Morris,Should take about two minutes.
Morris,Just PayPal me some bitcoins when you get a chance.
Leslie Knope,What?
Donna Meagle,"So, this is way under your budget."
Donna Meagle,Used to be a donut shop.
Donna Meagle,"Well, a tire shop  that sold donuts."
Tom Haverford,Pretty rough.
Tom Haverford,"I mean, I guess I could fix the roof and tear up the counters."
Tom Haverford,Do something about the smell.
April Ludgate,This place is creepy.
April Ludgate,"I mean, I love it, because it reminds me of the cafeteria in a haunted nursing home, but that's just me."
Donna Meagle,This is the last listing I have that isn't an active crime scene.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man, what happened?"
Tom Haverford,I thought Jurassic Fork was super popular.
Extra,We stretched ourselves too thin by expanding to a second location.
April Ludgate,You opened another dinosaur themed restaurant?
Extra,"No, another Steven Spielberg themed restaurant."
Extra,The German place downtown Schindler's Lunch.
Tom Haverford,I think you may have misunderstood what people liked about Jurassic Fork.
Tom Haverford,I actually think the space is pretty cool.
Tom Haverford,"Obviously, we'd had to move this T-Rex, but--"
Extra,No can do.
Extra,That's a load-bearing T-Rex.
Tom Haverford,This is really the last place you have available?
Tom Haverford,Dang.
Tom Haverford,Maybe Tom's Bistro wasn't meant to be.
Leslie Knope,You wanted to see me?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, real quick."
Ben Wyatt,Remember when you said you would close up shop on the slogan thing?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"You did do that, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the ""Stick up the butt"" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?"
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, someone wrote those emails."
Ben Wyatt,And we got about 300 complaints and as a cherry on top some hackers got really mad about the invasion of privacy and attacked the website.
Ben Wyatt,Look what they did to Peebo.
Ben Wyatt,He's wearing a hat made of penises.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt,"Well I.T. is fixing the website, but it will be down for about three days."
Leslie Knope,"Well, no worries, I will handle all of the overflow work personally."
Leslie Knope,"Parking tickets, code violations... send them all to me."
Ben Wyatt,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,I don't know.
Leslie Knope,"I spoke to grant about the national parks job, and he mentioned that's mostly big picture planning and delegating, and not very much nitty-gritty, hands on stuff that I love to do."
Leslie Knope,"I would miss that, very much."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, have I really pulled my last bloated raccoon carcass from a public fountain?"
Ben Wyatt,"But that's the whole point of moving up the ladder, you get to think bigger, swim in a bigger pond."
Ben Wyatt,"You're having a public forum on the slogan, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Use it as a test.
Ben Wyatt,"Hand the reins to someone else, let them handle things while you manage from a distance."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,That's a good idea.
Leslie Knope,I guess I should practice delegating.
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,The public forum will be run by…
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no, I would not have started the sentence if I knew Larry was the only one here."
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, if you can step back and let Larry take control, you can survive anything."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,"Larry, can you get in here?"
Jerry Gergich,I would love to.
Jerry Gergich,Gosh darn it.
Jerry Gergich,II somehow ran my belt through a slat in this chair so I'm kind of… I'm kind of stuck to it now.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,You really shouldn't have dug that out of the dumpster.
Andy Dwyer,I had to.
Andy Dwyer,Also I had a banana on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry.
Andy Dwyer," I get why you don't want any more to know about Duke Silver, and you don't have to worry."
Andy Dwyer, You secret is safe with me.
Andy Dwyer," To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets."
Ron Swanson," Oh, no, that's not necessary."
Andy Dwyer, I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks.
Andy Dwyer, I didn't actually sell my last car.
Andy Dwyer, I just forgot where I parked it.
Andy Dwyer, I don't know who Al Gore is.
Andy Dwyer, And at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
Andy Dwyer," When they say 2% milk, I don't know what the other 98% is."
Andy Dwyer," When I was a baby, my head was so big scientists did experiments on me."
Andy Dwyer," I once threw beer at a swan, and then it attacked my niece Rebecca."
Ron Swanson," That'll do, Andrew."
Andy Dwyer, You don't have to play the unity concert.
Andy Dwyer, But don't quit music.
Andy Dwyer, Please.
April Ludgate,Tommy.
Tom Haverford,Hey.
April Ludgate,Are you okay?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford, I just got excited about the restaurant but I should probably call my investor and tell him we have a problem.
April Ludgate," Well, I got you something to cheer you up."
April Ludgate, Watch cologne.
Tom Haverford, Cologne for watches.
Tom Haverford, Thanks.
Tom Haverford, Things used to make me so happy.
Tom Haverford, But I've grown a lot in the last year.
Tom Haverford," Now I just want one big thing, my own restaurant, named after me, that makes me so much money I can buy anything I want."
Tom Haverford, I should go.
April Ludgate," I didn't want Tom to leave, so I said all these bad things about the restaurant, so he wouldn't like them."
Donna Meagle," Damn, we should have coordinated."
Donna Meagle, I don't want to lose that weird little elf either.
Donna Meagle, That's why I showed him all those crappy places.
April Ludgate," Oh, I thought you were just bad at your job."
April Ludgate, Sorry.
April Ludgate, What should we do?
Donna Meagle,Let me call some people.
Leslie Knope," Hello, everyone, and welcome to a public forum to choose our new town slogan."
Leslie Knope," I'm gonna hand things over to Larry Gengurch, who is 100% in charge."
Jerry Gergich," Well, let's just get started, huh?"
Jerry Gergich,"I want to talk about-- Oh, it's the-- geez Louise-- This keeps happening."
Jerry Gergich, I don't know why.
Chance Frenlm," I think the slogan should be ""Pawnee, home of crackers, the orangest goldfish in Indiana."""
Jerry Gergich,Okey-dokey.
Leslie Knope,No.
Jerry Gergich, Let me write it down.
Herman,Who even needs a slogan?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, now, that is an interesting point."
Herman," No, that's my slogan idea."
Herman," ""Who even needs a slogan?"" And then a big picture of me flipping everybody off."
The Douche," Let's keep our eye on the ball here, Douche nation, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt."""
Crazy Ira,Butt stick! Butt stick! Butt stick!
The Douche,Let's vote on it right now! Butt stick! Butt stick!
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich, Who's next?
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, ma'am."
Extra, This slogan is gonna go on every sign in town.
Extra, I think it should be something real that we can all be proud of.
Extra," I've lived in Pawnee my whole life and it could be a strange place, but overall it's a warm, and wonderful town."
Extra," My idea for a slogan is, ""When you're here, then you're home."""
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that's lovely."
Extra, I actually had it printed up so we can see what it would look like.
Leslie Knope," Oh, you-- Hm--there's--that's--that's spelled wrong."
Leslie Knope," That should be ""then"", t-h-e-n."
Ben Wyatt, Stay strong.
Ben Wyatt, Let them work it out.
Ben Wyatt, And trust Larry.
Leslie Knope, Trust Larry?
Leslie Knope,Are you listening to yourself?
Extra,I like that slogan a lot.
Extra, But you made a little mistake there.
Ben Wyatt,You see?
Leslie Knope,Back off.
Extra," ""You're"" is spelled wrong."
Extra," It should be ""y-o-u-r."""
Jerry Gergich,"Oops, I didn't catch it."
Jerry Gergich, Thank you.
Leslie Knope," No, no, no, she made a possessive."
Leslie Knope,She's getting further away.
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Jerry Gergich," Okay, let's vote."
Jerry Gergich, All those in favor.
Jerry Gergich, Approved!
Tom Haverford,"Man, the places that came on the market today are way nicer than the listings we saw yesterday."
April Ludgate," I know, crazy, right? Real estate."
Donna Meagle," This property is under your budget, and it's got everything on this wish list you gave me."
Donna Meagle, Except the two helipads.
Tom Haverford, Does it have one helipad? I don't know.
Tom Haverford," I like it, but… seems a little small."
April Ludgate," No, I think it just seems small because of all the heavy furniture."
April Ludgate, But that part is really great.
April Ludgate, The lighting is really cool.
April Ludgate, I think this is the one.
Tom Haverford," You know, I think you're right."
Tom Haverford, I'll do it.
Tom Haverford," Thanks, April."
Tom Haverford," And, hey, bonus, it's pretty close to city hall."
Tom Haverford, You guys are gonna be regulars.
Tom Haverford, I'll keep a table open for you.
Councilman Milton, And special thanks to Leslie Knope for once again bringing about positive change to this town.
Councilman Milton," Pawnee, I present to you, your new slogan."
Ben Wyatt, You fixed the mistakes.
Leslie Knope, I held it together for the entire meeting.
Leslie Knope, Let me have this one.
Leslie Knope, I'm done micromanaging.
Leslie Knope, I promise.
Ben Wyatt, Then I'm sure you are okay with the fact that they installed the sign the wrong way and it's welcoming you to Pawnee as you're leaving.
Leslie Knope," What? No! Oh, son of a--"
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you passed the test."
Leslie Knope," Honestly, there's something else I'm worried about."
Leslie Knope," The kind of work that I've been doing all these years, the nuts and bolts, the grunt work, that's the stuff I know how to do."
Leslie Knope, What if I take this national parks jobs and I just… fail?
Ben Wyatt,Hm.
Leslie Knope,What if I'm not good at it?
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt," Leslie, I love you, very much."
Ben Wyatt, But this is the stupidest thing you've ever said.
Ben Wyatt, You'd be amazing.
Ben Wyatt," And everyone's gonna be in awe of how amazing you are, so just shut your month."
Extra," Hey, are we leaving or entering? We've been driving around in circles."
Leslie Knope, You're--

Ben Wyatt,"Aw, babe, you've gone crazy."
Leslie Knope,"The only thing I am crazy about is a magnificent, pregnant manta ray named Ann Perkins."
Leslie Knope,I am ranking topics of conversation for our next phone call.
Leslie Knope,The worst part about your best friend living in another stupid state is the topics really pile up.
Leslie Knope,What do you think should be higher priority?
Leslie Knope,Infinity scarves or whether or not it's worth it for me to get Showtime?
Ben Wyatt,Is this really necessary?
Leslie Knope,"When she moved, we promised each other that we would talk every day, and we've really fallen behind."
Ben Wyatt,"I know your female friends are very important to you, but I'm always a good sounding board."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I can talk about Sandra Bullock skirt length."
Leslie Knope,"No, no, babe, you can't… you would just embarrass yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, every time I start talking to you, five seconds later, I want to jump your bones."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, let's do that instead."
Leslie Knope,"See, that's what I'm talking about."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay, let's do this."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,On to the unity concert.
Leslie Knope,Ben is meeting with the tent people to finalize those deals.
Leslie Knope,"April and Donna will be helping me with the vendor location charts, and I will be meeting with the surveyors about the concert grounds."
Ron Swanson,I would like to volunteer to do the park survey myself.
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Ron."
Leslie Knope,I always knew there would be a day when I would get through to you and you would love government work.
Leslie Knope,Today is that historic day.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,That is what has happened.
Ron Swanson,Spending the day outside alone sounds like a dream.
Ron Swanson,"I love being a father, but there are a few things I miss."
Ron Swanson,"Silence, the absence of noise, one single moment undisturbed by the sounds of a children's TV program called Doc McStuffins."
Ron Swanson,There is no quiet anymore.
Ron Swanson,There is only Doc McStuffins.
Andy Dwyer,Sorry I'm late.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, Andy, why don't you go with Ron and help him?"
Ron Swanson,I really don't need--
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun!
Andy Dwyer,I call shotgun.
Andy Dwyer,Where are we going?
Andy Dwyer,Doesn't matter.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun on all rides for the rest of the day.
Andy Dwyer,For the rest of my life.
Andy Dwyer,In any car!
Andy Dwyer,Ha ha!
Andy Dwyer,I just faced you suckers!
Andy Dwyer,"So I'll see you in the parking lot, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Later!
Tom Haverford,Is the tent guy lefthanded or righthanded?
Tom Haverford,I just need to know which way to part my hair to get us a better price.
Tom Haverford,It's a business theory I'm working on.
Ben Wyatt,I really don't think it matters.
Ben Wyatt,Pretty straightforward deal.
Tom Haverford,A straightforward deal?
Tom Haverford,Why didn't you tell me?
Tom Haverford,I don't have my straightforward deal fedora on me.
Tom Haverford,We gotta stop by my storage unit on the way up.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Larry."
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, you wanna come with us to tent world?"
Ben Wyatt,Little road trip?
Jerry Gergich,Tent world?
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, let me grab my lunch."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Why'd you invite Larry?
Ben Wyatt,He's been doing all the paperwork for this deal.
Ben Wyatt,He deserves to come.
Tom Haverford,Remember you said that when Larry's farting up the car.
Ben Wyatt,Larry isn't that bad.
Ben Wyatt,He's nice.
Ben Wyatt,"And frankly, I don't care who knows that I said that, as long as no one knows that I said that."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, ladies, I will be in my office for one to seven hours for my weekly chat with Ann."
Leslie Knope,I brought some fresh snacks.
Leslie Knope,"And I made a backup plan for the vendor chart in case, you know, yours isn't good."
Donna Meagle,"Actually, Ann called while you were in the bathroom."
Donna Meagle,"She said something came up, she'll call you later."
Donna Meagle,"I don't know, I told her to leave you a voice mail."
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,"God, why'd you let me say all that?"
Leslie Knope,"I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!"
Leslie Knope,I'm coming!
Ann Perkins,Listen to me very carefully.
Ann Perkins,I have not been taken.
Ann Perkins,"I know that's always your first fear when I'm not available, but this is not a Liam Neeson Taken scenario."
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what they'd make you say.
Ann Perkins,"Also, no one's making me say this."
Ann Perkins,"I am a free woman, untaken, simply going about my business."
Ann Perkins,I just have to run.
Ann Perkins,Something came up.
Ann Perkins,"I love you, and I'll call you later."
Leslie Knope,Donna.
Leslie Knope,"What's good, baby?"
Leslie Knope,What's going down in Donna town?
Leslie Knope,What's the haps in Meaglewood?
Donna Meagle,I'm listening to Jaleel Or No Deal.
Donna Meagle,It's a podcast where the kid who played Urkel reviews old Deal Or No Deal episodes.
Donna Meagle,"It's pointless, and I love it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, don't let me interrupt."
Leslie Knope,"April, what's the 411, little mama?"
Leslie Knope,What's the hot goss?
Leslie Knope,Who you crushing on these days?
April Ludgate,"Ew, my husband, weirdo."
April Ludgate,Can I get back to work now?
April Ludgate,Thanks.
April Ludgate,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Work?
Leslie Knope,You can work whenever.
Leslie Knope,"Except for now, because now is lady time."
April Ludgate,You sound like a tampon commercial.
Leslie Knope,I'm setting up an impromptu Galentine's day.
April Ludgate,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Wait, I thought you weren't gonna do Galentine's day this year because that she-beast moved away."
April Ludgate,I believe her name was Satan?
Leslie Knope,"Her name is Ann, and she is gone, and I have accepted it, and we are gonna have Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies, up front."
Leslie Knope,"I need an Ann who lives in Pawnee, and there is no one obvious candidate, so I will test them out on the ultimate battlefield of female friendship Galentine's day brunch."
Leslie Knope,It will be a women's only marathon bonding session with tons of whipped cream.
Leslie Knope,"Side note, do not Google that phrase."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,Can I ask you kind of an important question?
Andy Dwyer,"You know, like, when you go to the ATM and you get money, is there an actual guy standing behind the wall who slides dollar bills in there?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It's robots.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, actually, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,I do have a serious question.
Andy Dwyer,"In the movie Predator, can you rub any kind of mud on yourself to prevent predator from seeing you with his thermal heat signature sight, or is it more-- Ow!"
Andy Dwyer,That sucks.
Ron Swanson,Are you hurt?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,All good.
Andy Dwyer,All good.
Andy Dwyer,Oops.
Andy Dwyer,Except for my mouth.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, whoa."
Andy Dwyer,Five second rule.
Andy Dwyer,"No, ahh."
Ron Swanson,"Come on, we better get you to a dentist."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God, Larry."
Tom Haverford,Your tuna fish sandwich stunk up my suit.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle made it for me.
Tom Haverford,Irrelevant.
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,Stay out here and double-check these deal memos.
Tom Haverford,"If you get through 'em, triple-check 'em."
Tom Haverford,Just don't come inside.
Jerry Gergich,Sounds good.
Jerry Gergich,I will finish my sandwich and enjoy the view.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Harvey."
Ben Wyatt,Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,We spoke on the phone.
Harvey,Yeah.
Harvey,"Yeah, we sure did."
Harvey,Okay.
Harvey,Who's this little genie right here?
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, Pawnee business liaison."
Harvey,Okay.
Harvey,Got your contracts for you right here.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,It's a lot thicker than the original one page version.
Harvey,"I take tents pretty seriously, Ben, I'm a tent guy."
Harvey,"I got over 1,300 tents in this warehouse alone."
Harvey,"900 of those are over 2,000 square feet, 80 of them are striped, and exactly 4 of 'em were once rented by Miss Rene Russo."
Tom Haverford,Whoa!
Harvey,Yeah.
Harvey,No doy.
Harvey,I think I know what I'm doing.
Harvey,So I added a few syllables and whatnot.
Harvey,"Clauses, et cetera."
Harvey,"Addendums, what have you."
Harvey,Why don't we go ahead and sign that for me?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I think we're gonna need to take a look at this."
Tom Haverford,Hmm.
Tom Haverford,So I guess this is not a straightforward deal.
Leslie Knope,"Shauna, I'm so glad you could make it."
Leslie Knope,You're so tan.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Oh, thanks."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I just got back from a solo trip to Rome.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I was gonna go with my boyfriend, but he couldn't come because he decided to stay with his wife."
Leslie Knope,Oof.
Evelyn,I love Rome.
Evelyn,It's such a great place.
Donna Meagle,Rome's played out.
Donna Meagle,Have y'all been to Kuala Lumpur?
Leslie Knope,When did you go to Asia?
Donna Meagle,I go all the time.
Donna Meagle,Where do you think I got that crystal Buddha head above my jacuzzi?
Leslie Knope,You have a jacuzzi?
Leslie Knope,Good to know.
Leslie Knope,Prospects for new Pawnee best friend.
Leslie Knope,Donna Meagle.
Leslie Knope,"Confident, worldly, we go way back."
Leslie Knope,April Ludgate.
Leslie Knope,"Vivid imagination, young, and vibrant."
Leslie Knope,Shauna Malwae-Tweep.
Leslie Knope,"Pretty, fragile, makes terrible life decisions."
Leslie Knope,"A real fixer-upper, but look, it's not like Ann was doing so hot when I met her."
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,Bit of a dark horse.
Leslie Knope,"Crotchety, but probably wise."
Leslie Knope,"And then we got Evelyn, aka fake Ann."
Leslie Knope,I don't know her last name.
Leslie Knope,Honestly we just needed bodies.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, everyone, for getting together on such short notice, and happy Galentine's day."
Leslie Knope,"Now, this is not technically the right date, but any time a group of women get together for brunch, we embody the spirit of the holiday."
Leslie Knope,"Today we will celebrate friendship, spend a few hours together, and answer a couple of questions I've compiled."
Leslie Knope,Just for fun.
Leslie Knope,Nothing serious.
Leslie Knope,But please answer them with complete honesty 'cause I'll be able to tell if you're lying.
Leslie Knope,To girlfriends!
April Ludgate,Yay.
Donna Meagle,Girlfriends.
Leslie Knope,Whoohoo!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, it's time for a little Galentine's day Q&A."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, you pick first."
Donna Meagle,"""What is your favorite TV show?"""
Donna Meagle,"Well, for live tweeting, it's Scandal."
Donna Meagle,"For binge watching, it's Scandal."
Donna Meagle,"But for fashion, it's actually Scandal."
Donna Meagle,My answer is Scandal.
Leslie Knope,Hmm.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,"Ooh, I love watching Russian traffic accidents on YouTube while I play children's music at the wrong RPM."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I like beauty pageants.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Everyone is so happy and perfect.
Ethel Beavers,I like Diagnosis Murder.
Ethel Beavers,And skin flicks.
Ethel Beavers,Can anybody top me off?
Leslie Knope,The correct answer for favorite TV show is Friday Night Lights.
Donna Meagle,The correct answer?
Leslie Knope,Next question.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this contract is insane."
Ben Wyatt,It costs extra to have people inside the tents?
Ben Wyatt,And what's a flap tax?
Harvey,"Well, you need flaps, bro."
Harvey,A tent without flaps is basically a parachute.
Tom Haverford,An unfolding charge?
Tom Haverford,A noise damage waiver?
Tom Haverford,How can noise damage tents?
Harvey,Shh.
Harvey,"Keep your voice down, please, there's tents here."
Harvey,"Now, look, you can argue with me all you want, but for every line item that you two idiots disagree with, there's gonna be a 50 dollar discussion surcharge."
Harvey,"What are we up to, doll?"
Extra,400 dollars.
Ben Wyatt,A discussion surcharge?
Ben Wyatt,That's nuts.
Harvey,450 dollars.
Ben Wyatt,That's it.
Ben Wyatt,Deal's off.
Ben Wyatt,We'll take our business elsewhere.
Harvey,"Suit yourself, gentlemen."
Harvey,Sorry we couldn't make a deal.
Tom Haverford,"Wait, wait."
Tom Haverford,Let me try one more thing.
Tom Haverford,What's the price now?
Harvey,80 dollars more.
Harvey,I liked it better the other way.
Tom Haverford,"Does have an effect, though."
Ron Swanson,The receptionist says she'll fit you in as soon as there's an opening.
Ron Swanson,"If you're all right, I'm gonna head back to the park."
Andy Dwyer,"Wait, wait, wait, real quick, real quick."
Andy Dwyer,Do you know what my social security number is?
Andy Dwyer,Or if I'm allergic to anything?
Andy Dwyer,I don't like corn.
Andy Dwyer,Should I put that down?
Andy Dwyer,Or will that be confusing?
Andy Dwyer,Because I do like candy corn.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,What a mess.
Andy Dwyer,"Here, let me help you."
Ron Swanson,All I wanted was two hours where I got to forget that I was a parent.
Andy Dwyer,"Ron, look."
Andy Dwyer,I found all three differences.
Ron Swanson,Those are two completely different pictures.
April Ludgate,"""Ladies' choice."""
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,Wild card option.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, anybody reveal anything about their life, anything at all."
Donna Meagle,I've gotten two annulments.
Donna Meagle,"One for pleasure, and one to cap off a long con I was running against Keith Sweat."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Ethel, have you --Okay, Ethel's asleep."
Leslie Knope,Shauna?
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,I'm writing a memoir based on my blog.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"It's called Tweeping Up Appearances, and it's about my journey to find happiness by smiling through the pain."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I can work with that."
Donna Meagle,"Knope, what you got going on in that notebook?"
Leslie Knope,Just jotting down memories in my trusty old journal.
April Ludgate,"""Friendship rankings."""
April Ludgate,What's that?
Leslie Knope,It's not what it sounds like.
Leslie Knope,It's simply a way for me to figure out which one of you is the best.
Donna Meagle,That's messed up.
April Ludgate,"Yeah, that is really lame, and I'm leaving."
Donna Meagle,"You're better than that, Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Donna, why are you angry?"
Leslie Knope,You were in first place.
Evelyn,"Bye, everyone."
Evelyn,This was a really... brunch.
Leslie Knope,Leave the bag.
Ethel Beavers,"If you do this again next year, don't call me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, by default, it's Shauna."
Leslie Knope,"That's how you want to find your new best friend, right?"
Leslie Knope,By default?
Tom Haverford,My pores are clogged up from being in that dusty warehouse.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna check if this gas station has some biore strips.
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, thanks, Larry, that's nice of you."
Jerry Gergich,Gayle always has me do the windshield.
Jerry Gergich,She likes to stand behind me and watch.
Jerry Gergich,"According to her, it's the best view."
Ben Wyatt,How is Gayle?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, wonderful."
Ben Wyatt,And the girls?
Jerry Gergich,They're good.
Jerry Gergich,Why do you want to know?
Ben Wyatt,I'm genuinely interested.
Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.
Jerry Gergich,I'm just not used to people from the office asking me things.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of scary.
Jerry Gergich,"But in a good way, though."
Tom Haverford,"Aw, man, did I miss a Larry fart?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, uh, we were just--"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, Tom."
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, I really ripped one."
Jerry Gergich,"Didn't I, Ben?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it was loud."
Tom Haverford,Smells like a hippopotamus took a dump on a skunk.
Jerry Gergich,It's in your best interest.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, the numbers don't lie."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm a goofus, not a gallant."
Andy Dwyer,Been here forever.
Andy Dwyer,Can we go?
Ron Swanson,Don't you want to get your tooth fixed?
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, I think my tooth looks fine just like this."
Ron Swanson,"Well, my grandmother was missing that tooth, and she was the most beautiful woman on her oil rig."
Ron Swanson,You are an adult.
Ron Swanson,I am not your dad.
Ron Swanson,"If you want to go, we can go."
Andy Dwyer,Yay.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"That's why you know even though you're not my dad, you're like an old brother to me."
Andy Dwyer,"Like a cool uncle, but old."
Andy Dwyer,Like a grandpa.
Andy Dwyer,But cool like a son.
Tom Haverford,Thank you very much.
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Extra,No problem.
Extra,"That'll be $8, please."
Ben Wyatt,"What, you're charging us for coffee?"
Ben Wyatt,What kind of a business... Uh-oh.
Harvey,"Oh, hello, gentlemen."
Ben Wyatt,Gotta be kidding me.
Ben Wyatt,You own this place too?
Harvey,"That's right, dickweed."
Harvey,You wanna talk deal?
Harvey,Because my prices have gone up ever so slightly since I saw you last.
Ben Wyatt,"No, we're not giving in to your crazy demands."
Ben Wyatt,There are plenty of other tent rental places within driving distance.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, I'm calling Tent Emporium right now."
Harvey,Tent Emporium.
Harvey,"How can I help you, buttface?"
Ben Wyatt,What?
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Harvey,Yes.
Harvey,I own every tent store in Southern Indiana.
Harvey,"Tent Town, Rent Ten Tents, the Tent Offensive, and Ace Tentura Tent Detective."
Harvey,"I also own a chickfila franchise, but that's not doing so hot right now."
Harvey,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get outta here.
Harvey,You've reached the Tentagon.
Harvey,"How can I help you, buttface?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, here's an idea."
Leslie Knope,"Why don't we find something, anything, no matter how small, that we have in common?"
Leslie Knope,"For example, I'm an only child."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Me too.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Although, when I was in college I found out that my dad had a second family."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, we were the second family, technically."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, we both went to college."
Leslie Knope,There's that.
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Ann had her baby!
Leslie Knope,"Wow, this has been fun."
Leslie Knope,The bill is already paid.
Leslie Knope,May I gently suggest that you check out Chris Traeger's wonderful therapist Dr. Richard Nygard.
Leslie Knope,Although there is a tiny part of me that always thought it was just Chris talking into a mirror.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, maybe you should look him up."
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I don't know, I read a book once that said a woman should never make the first move."
Leslie Knope,That doesn't apply to therapy.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Good luck!
Ann Perkins,"Oliver Perkins-Traeger, meet your Aunt Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, he's so beautiful."
Leslie Knope,And you're so beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, you're always beautiful, but right now you are the most beautiful, glowing sun goddess ever."
Leslie Knope,Why didn't you tell me you were in labor?
Ann Perkins,"Well, 'cause I knew you'd drop everything and rush here, and contractions can sometimes go for days."
Ann Perkins,Thank you.
Ann Perkins,So I didn't want you to be stuck waiting around.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I'm glad I'm here now."
Leslie Knope,Where's Chris?
Ann Perkins,"Oh, he was such a good coach that the nurses asked him to help out with a delivery down the hall."
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Ow.
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, you need to get your tooth fixed."
Andy Dwyer,No way.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not going back there.
Andy Dwyer,I already won all the magazine mazes.
Andy Dwyer,Don't worry.
Andy Dwyer,It's gonna be fine.
Andy Dwyer,Ow!
Ron Swanson,"If you don't take care of the problem now, it's only gonna get worse."
Ron Swanson,Come on.
Ron Swanson,I'll drive you back.
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,Let me just wolf down this peanut brittle real quick.
Andy Dwyer,Why would you do that?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, right."
Andy Dwyer,'Cause calories.
Tom Haverford,We're dead.
Tom Haverford,The only tent store this guy doesn't own is 300 miles away.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, hang on."
Ben Wyatt,Here's a place that might work.
Ben Wyatt,It's called Sweaty Roger's Pants Tent.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, you can't rent tents there."
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys."
Jerry Gergich,"Look, I was doublechecking all the paperwork that Tom gave me in that super fun parking lot, and there was something about Harvey's corporate structure that just seemed fishy."
Jerry Gergich,So I dug around and it turns out he has got a lot of code violations.
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,"Larry, this is great stuff."
Tom Haverford,"Never thought I would say it, but I'm a genius for making you stay outside and do a menial task."
Jerry Gergich,Couldn't agree more.
Jerry Gergich,"You did it, Tom."
Leslie Knope,"Mm, I don't want to drive back."
Leslie Knope,I miss you so much.
Leslie Knope,No one even comes close to you as a friend.
Leslie Knope,"I even tried to rank the women at work,  but that was a total bust."
Ann Perkins,You ranked them?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I thought maybe I could use Galentine's day as an opportunity--"
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, Galentine's day?"
Leslie Knope,"What do you want me to do, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,"I need to find a replacement, and don't worry, it didn't work."
Leslie Knope,Nobody can match your ethnic hybrid energy.
Ann Perkins,Everybody brings their own unique strengths to the table.
Ann Perkins,Some that even I don't have.
Leslie Knope,You shut your mouth.
Leslie Knope,You have all the strengths.
Ann Perkins,"Look, you love harder than anyone I know."
Ann Perkins,It's tough to match.
Ann Perkins,"And I know Donna and April don't show it, but they would do anything for you."
Ann Perkins,And it's not like you and I always see eye to eye.
Ann Perkins,"I mean, Friday Night Lights?"
Ann Perkins,"I am more of a Riggins girl, and you lean Saracen."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, 'cause Riggins is a criminal."
Ann Perkins,He took the fall for his brother.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, he didn't watch out for his brother."
Ann Perkins,"You know, I'm not having this conversation with you again."
Leslie Knope, That family is garbage.
Ann Perkins, The point is we didn't always like the same stuff when we first became friends.
Ann Perkins, Just don't force it.
Ann Perkins, Give it some time.
Leslie Knope," I know, you're right, Ann."
Leslie Knope, Thank you.
Leslie Knope," It's just I'm missing you, and there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about."
Ann Perkins," Well, you're here now, so let's talk."
Leslie Knope, Oh.
Leslie Knope, I think Oliver has more pressing business.
Ann Perkins," Okay, but we should talk soon, 'cause I almost bought a toe ring the other day."
Leslie Knope," What? Ann, you're somebody's mother."
Ann Perkins,I know.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope, I'm gonna give you two some time.
Leslie Knope, I'll call you from the car.
Ron Swanson, I'll be out here if you need me.
Andy Dwyer," Thanks for doing this, Ron."
Andy Dwyer," When it's all said and done, there were a few mazes I'd cheated on."
Andy Dwyer," Also, the inside of my mouth is black and hot."
Andy Dwyer," So do I strip down to my underwear, or all the way naked?"
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Diane."
Ron Swanson," I'm coming home soon to relieve you, give you a little break."
Ron Swanson, It's no trouble at all.
Ron Swanson, I'm a parent.
Ron Swanson, I'm always on duty.
Ron Swanson, What flavor ice cream would you and the children like?
Ron Swanson,"I'm getting some for a 30-year-old who works for me, so I can bring some home for you too."
Ben Wyatt," Hello, Harvey."
Ben Wyatt, We found a glaring number of code violations you've committed.
Ben Wyatt, I could see to it that you never rent another tent in this region again.
Harvey," Gentlemen, I've won two online satellite Jamaican poker tournaments."
Harvey, I can tell that you're bluffing.
Tom Haverford," Your Pawnee business license has lapsed, which negates most of the deals you've made this year."
Tom Haverford, I'm guessing you're pretty bad at poker.
Harvey, I am.
Harvey, And I was bluffing about winning those tournaments.
Harvey," Gentlemen, clearly there's been a misunderstanding here."
Harvey, I'm hoping that we can reach some kind of a compromise.
Tom Haverford," Yeah, first off, I need to know where you got these zebra-print pillows."
Tom Haverford," Second of all, I got a Tin Cup Blu-Ray itching for a Rene Russo signature."
Ben Wyatt, Tom.
Ben Wyatt, The compromise is that you're gonna sign the deal we originally agreed upon.
Ben Wyatt," We're going to let you continue renting tents, and you're going to do it at a fair price."
Ben Wyatt," And Larry, he's the guy that brought you down, and he's gonna be watching you like a hawk."
Jerry Gergich," Oh, hey."
Jerry Gergich, I'm Larry.
Jerry Gergich, Great to know you.
Jerry Gergich, I love tent world.
Tom Haverford, God! Can you just be cool for one second?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, black coffee with extra grounds."
Leslie Knope, Gross.
Leslie Knope, For April.
Leslie Knope, And a mocha ice blended for Donna.
Leslie Knope," Guys, I totally blew it."
Leslie Knope," I was all screwed up, and I'm really sorry."
Leslie Knope," You're wonderful friends, and I love you."
Donna Meagle," We love your crazy ass too, Knope."
April Ludgate, I think you're fine.
April Ludgate, Like a solid B-minus.
Leslie Knope, Great.
Leslie Knope, I'll take it.
April Ludgate," We know you've been missing Ann, so we got you this."
Donna Meagle, Press the paw.
Ann Perkins," Hi, Leslie."
Ann Perkins, It's Ann.
Ann Perkins," I love you, and everything's gonna be okay."
Donna Meagle," It's cute, right?"
Leslie Knope,I'm very lucky to have you both.
Leslie Knope," You know, when Ann and I used to fight, we would make up with a five-minute hug."
April Ludgate," Mm, you touch me and I stab the bunny."
Donna Meagle," Yeah, it's about time for my mid-morning mani, so I'm gonna head out."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," Well, that's fine."
Leslie Knope," Well, you know, we'll forge our own unique traditions in the fiery cauldron of female friendship."
April Ludgate," I'm just an impartial bunny, but I think Ann sucks."
April Ludgate, Also-- I'm the zodiac killer.
Tom Haverford, And we might even be able to pull it off under budget.
Jerry Gergich, Sorry.
Jerry Gergich," Sorry, you guys, I'm sorry."
Jerry Gergich," I'm trying to find my inhaler, 'cause I'm having a little…"
Tom Haverford,Take your time.
Tom Haverford," I mean, it's not like we're trying to get work done here."
April Ludgate," Yeah, and Larry, by the way, you're looking in the wrong spot."
April Ludgate," Your inhaler is hidden under the pile of pistachio shells on my desk, obviously."
Jerry Gergich," Okay, well, that's funny, 'cause I'm terribly allergic to pistachios."
Andy Dwyer, Classic.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, you know what? I need to say something."
Ben Wyatt, I like Larry.
Ben Wyatt," He is a good friend and a fine man with an inexplicably gorgeous wife-- I mean, to the point where it makes no sense at all."
Ben Wyatt, Sorry.
Ben Wyatt, Getting off track.
Ben Wyatt," He is a nice person, and we should all stand up and say, ""I... Like..."""
Tom Haverford,Ben! No! What are you doing?
Donna Meagle,"Uh, he's embarrassing himself and throwing away his career."
Leslie Knope,"Sweetheart, stop."
Ben Wyatt,"O, captain, my captain."
Ron Swanson,What is happening?
Ben Wyatt,Larry is my friend.
Jerry Gergich," Thank you, Ben."
Jerry Gergich, I mean that.
Jerry Gergich, Oh! Got so startled I tooted.
Ben Wyatt," Come on, man."
April Ludgate,"Oh, Gross!   "

,Season: 6 Episode: 17
Ben Wyatt,God!
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Leslie Knope,Sorry!
Ben Wyatt,What's happening?
Ben Wyatt,I can't hear!
Ben Wyatt,And I'm dying!
Leslie Knope,"Baby, relax."
Leslie Knope,I just wanted to surprise you.
Leslie Knope,Open the bottom drawer and read the cake.
Ben Wyatt,"""Will you go to prom with me?"""
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this just keeps getting weirder."
Leslie Knope,"Because of the merger, schools have had to make some cuts, and the first thing to go was the senior prom."
Leslie Knope,"So as a last minute hail Mary, the parks department is throwing prom for them."
Leslie Knope,"They also wanted to cut A.P. Latin, so I volunteered to teach Latin."
Leslie Knope,"Which reminds me, I need to learn Latin."
Leslie Knope,"I can't stop thinking about that job in Chicago, and I think this prom will be a good distraction."
Leslie Knope,"In my senior year when I couldn't decide between Indiana and Amherst, I focused all my energy on planning my prom, and it was the best prom ever."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.V. Club."
Ben Wyatt,"Hmm, I think I'm jealous of Harvey."
Leslie Knope,You shouldn't be.
Leslie Knope,"A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution."
Leslie Knope,Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.
Leslie Knope,"The point is, will you go to the prom with me?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I thought you'd never ask, because we're nearing 40."
Ben Wyatt,Course I will.
Leslie Knope,Yay!
Leslie Knope,Prom!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are making progress, prom committee."
Leslie Knope,"Now, our budget is basically zero, so we're gonna need to cover all the jobs that we would normally hire people for."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, you're in charge of music."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, man."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, all right."
Leslie Knope,"Aw, did you want to DJ, little puppy?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't know that little puppies could operate an iPod with their little puppy paws.
Donna Meagle,Eew and boo.
Donna Meagle,This kind of thing is getting out of hand with you two.
Donna Meagle,Y'all are on official warning.
Ben Wyatt,I did DJ a little back in the day.
Ben Wyatt,"I had a show called ""Zoot Suit Wyatt"" on Carleton College radio."
Ben Wyatt,"Tuesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 A.M., I was the king of swing."
Tom Haverford,I thought we as a culture agreed to forget the year that everyone was into swing.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Ben, you can co-DJ with Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Tom Haverford,What!
Tom Haverford,No!
Tom Haverford,"If you eclipse my flavor in any way, we'll have a problem."
Leslie Knope,"All right, Allison, you are in charge of choosing the prom theme, and now it has to be perfect and magical and look like a million bucks but cost zero bucks."
Leslie Knope,So what do you got?
Allison,"I was thinking the theme could be ""Fairy tale."""
Allison,"The theater department did Into the Woods last year, and we still have the scenery."
Allison,I laid out some preliminary plans in this binder.
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,Are those jense-trodder color tabs?
Leslie Knope,I thought those were discontinued.
Allison,They were.
Allison,I had to order them through some Mexican back channels.
Leslie Knope,Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?
Leslie Knope,I thought they went out of business.
Allison,"They did, but they opened up a new one in Oaxaca."
Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody get back to work."
Leslie Knope,"And, Allison, come by my office later so we can keep crushing it."
Ben Wyatt,"All right, let's go over our set list."
Tom Haverford,Set list?
Tom Haverford,No need.
Ben Wyatt,"So, what, you're just gonna put your iPod on shuffle?"
Tom Haverford,"No, but I could."
Tom Haverford,You want to know why?
Ben Wyatt,Because every single song you own is a banger?
Tom Haverford,Every song I download has to pass a series of rigorous tests to answer one simple question: Is it a banger?
Tom Haverford,How many beats per minute?
Tom Haverford,How many drops?
Tom Haverford,How dope are the drops?
Tom Haverford,Were any acoustic instruments used?
Tom Haverford,"If so, it is not a banger."
Tom Haverford,I once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song.
Tom Haverford,I had to throw away my whole computer just to be safe.
Ben Wyatt,"I feel like, to me, set list flow is very important."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're basically vibe curators."
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"I hope that high school auditorium's big enough, 'cause I'm bringing 10000 maniacs."
Tom Haverford,Sometimes it's really hard to be friends with you.
Tom Haverford,Thank God we don't have to be seen together.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we do."
Ben Wyatt,We're co-DJs.
Tom Haverford,Not anymore.
Tom Haverford,You're working with DJ Robo Drop.
Tom Haverford,"Badada, mm, mm, mm, mmmm"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I hope that this prom is exactly like my senior prom."
Andy Dwyer,"Theme: ""My heart will go on."""
Andy Dwyer,Photo booth with Monica Lewinsky lookalike.
Andy Dwyer,Afterparty Megan Rickerson's house.
Andy Dwyer,Her parents used to let us drink as much as we wanted.
Andy Dwyer,That's… that's where we should have this afterparty.
Andy Dwyer,"Or, no, we can't, because they moved to prison."
April Ludgate,"Prom is nothing but a huge party full of smiling, dancing people enjoying themselves."
April Ludgate,It's literally my worst nightmare.
April Ludgate,And I hate punch.
Andy Dwyer,"April Ludgate, I'm gonna sing to you a song that I first wrote 15 years ago for my prom date, Sarah Weiss."
Andy Dwyer,"You're as hot as the sun but you're as cold as ice let me take you to paradise come on, roll the dice it will be twice as nice Sarah Wei-- April Ludgate will you go to prom with me?"
Andy Dwyer,Boom!
Andy Dwyer,Will you?
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,"I'll go with you, because Leslie's making us, and we live together, and we only have one car right now because you laked mine."
Jerry Gergich,"What does ""laked"" mean?"
Andy Dwyer,I tried to jump it over a lake.
Andy Dwyer,"Why don't you stay out of our conversations, Larry!"
Jerry Gergich,Will do.
Leslie Knope,"So I want to show you some very cool before and after pictures of Cherryhurst Park, one of our greatest accomplishments."
Allison,Why are you showing me all this?
Leslie Knope,Because I think you have a real knack for public service.
Leslie Knope,"We here at the parks department have something called ""The April Ludgate Summer Solstice Druid Festival and Buffalo Wings Eating Contest."""
Leslie Knope,I don't know why I let her name it.
Leslie Knope,"Basically, it's a summer internship program."
Leslie Knope,I think you'd be great.
Leslie Knope,Do you want to work here?
Allison,Definitely!
Allison,I'm totally interested.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,Allison Gliffert.
Allison,"Hi, Mr. Swanson."
Leslie Knope,You two know each other?
Leslie Knope,Is there some secret society for the greatest humans on earth?
Leslie Knope,Do you meet Tom Hanks and Elena Kagan in the Statue of Liberty's crown?
Leslie Knope,"God, this fake club I'm inventing is amazing."
Ron Swanson,Allison's father owns the hardware store I've been going to since before Allison was even born.
Ron Swanson,What brings you to the festering putrid stink hole on the armpit of freedom?
Leslie Knope,That's what he calls city hall.
Allison,"Um, Leslie was just telling me about your summer internship, and I was thinking about taking it."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, no, no, no, no."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,I respect your father too much to let his daughter work for free for the government.
Ron Swanson,Why don't you get a paying job for the summer?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you shut your mustache?
Leslie Knope,Sorry.
Ron Swanson,You know what?
Ron Swanson,"Tim Hautner, who owns the sawmill out on Lowell Drive, is a personal friend."
Ron Swanson,He's always looking for bright young employees to give money to in exchange for honest work.
Allison,That would be awesome.
Allison,I definitely need money for school.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,"Is it worth a few bucks to get a million splinters in your fingers and then cut off your fingers accidentally, 'cause that will happen."
Ron Swanson,I have tolerated Leslie's pro-government ways because her annoying kindness and generosity sneakily made me like her as a person.
Ron Swanson,But I draw the line at corrupting America's youth.
Ron Swanson,I'm sure I can get Allison a job at Tim Hautner's sawmill.
Ron Swanson,I once did him a favor.
Ron Swanson,I built his sawmill.
Leslie Knope,I may be leaving this office soon.
Leslie Knope,I need to plant seeds for the next generation.
Leslie Knope,"Interns become fulltime staff, become department directors."
Leslie Knope,Circle of life.
Leslie Knope,The seasons turn.
Leslie Knope,It's really quite beautiful.
Leslie Knope,"And if Ron tries to stop me, he can eat a big ol' bowl of butts."
Andy Dwyer,Hee hee!
Andy Dwyer,Hah hah yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Pawnee!
Andy Dwyer,Class of '99!
Andy Dwyer,Uh-huh!
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,"Girl, you look creepy."
Andy Dwyer,Would you like a drink?
Andy Dwyer,All this stuff is free.
Extra,"No, it's not."
April Ludgate,Why'd you pay for a limo?
Andy Dwyer,Because it's prom.
Andy Dwyer,"If you don't show up in a limo, legally, they can't let you in."
Andy Dwyer,Does your mom want to take pictures?
April Ludgate,"Uh, yeah, she does."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, hey!"
Andy Dwyer,Orin!
Orin,Who's Orin?
Orin,I'm April's mom.
Orin,You two look adorable.
April Ludgate,"Ugh, just take the picture already, mom."
Orin,My baby is all grown up.
Orin,Have her home by 11:00.
April Ludgate,"Mom, stop embarrassing me."
Orin,Say goodbye to your father.
April Ludgate,"Bye, dad."
Andy Dwyer,"Good night, sir."
Tom Haverford,This is all the stuff we have to work with?
Tom Haverford,Where's everything I requested?
Tom Haverford,Where's my smoke machine?
Tom Haverford,Where's my girls dressed in Teddy Bear costumes?
Tom Haverford,Where's my Yeezus Mountain?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, tell me about it."
Ben Wyatt,I specifically requested elliptical cartridges for the turntables.
Ben Wyatt,How am I supposed to keep my Husker Du albums in nearmint condish?
Tom Haverford,"Hey, I have an idea."
Tom Haverford,Why don't you throw them in the garbage?
Ben Wyatt,"My prom was right after I got impeached, so I couldn't leave the house without being egged."
Ben Wyatt,But my parents threw me a prom in our living room.
Ben Wyatt,I think I'm still messed up from it.
Tom Haverford,I was actually only at my prom for 15 minutes.
Tom Haverford,"By the time I got my Armani suit pressed and got the little dimple on my tie just right, it was 11:45 P.M."
Tom Haverford,"My date was pretty pissed, but, uh, I looked fly as hell."
Principal Russell,"Leslie, thanks again."
Principal Russell,We just wouldn't have had a prom without you.
Principal Russell,This is Aplus work.
Leslie Knope,Aplus!
Principal Russell,"Thank you, Principal Russell."
Leslie Knope,Can I get that in writing?
Principal Russell,"Oh-ho, Leslie."
Principal Russell,You haven't changed since high school.
Allison,I can't believe he gave you an Aplus.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, did he?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't even notice.
Leslie Knope,No bigs.
Leslie Knope,"Listen, Allison, I have a question for you that's very important and very serious."
Leslie Knope,Listen to me closely.
Leslie Knope,Will you help me orchestrate the balloon drop?
Allison,"Ms. Knope, it'd be my honor."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, hooray!"
Ron Swanson,Allison.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ron Swanson,I was subcontracted by the government to construct a lighting rig.
Ron Swanson,Would like to help me screw some angle irons onto some 2x4s?
Ron Swanson,I'll give you $40.
Allison,"Yeah, sure."
Leslie Knope,I'll just be over here having fun.
Leslie Knope,See you soon!
Leslie Knope,"I know what you're doing, Ron, and I will defeat you."
Leslie Knope,Mark my words.
Ron Swanson,Stop wasting helium.
Ron Swanson,It is intended for welding and filling air ships.
Ron Swanson,I attended prom with Susan Hofler.
Ron Swanson,"Picked her up in my truck, we slow-danced to a Merle Haggard song, and then I left early to go to my shift at the quarry."
Ron Swanson,I was 12 years old.
Ron Swanson,Never went again.
Ron Swanson,Felt like I had outgrown it.
April Ludgate,"Well, we did it."
April Ludgate,We went to prom.
April Ludgate,Yay!
April Ludgate,Let's go now.
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Are you kidding?
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Look around.
Andy Dwyer,The bloom of youth.
Andy Dwyer,Like flowers on the sunset of an eagle's poetry.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I hate teenagers."
Andy Dwyer,"If you give this a chance, you're gonna love it, I promise."
Andy Dwyer,It's like the movie Expendables 2.
Andy Dwyer,"First time, hated it."
Andy Dwyer,"Second time, hated it."
Andy Dwyer,"Third time, it was okay."
Andy Dwyer,"But then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth time I watched it, I realized something."
Andy Dwyer,It's just-- it's not good.
Andy Dwyer,It's not a good movie.
Andy Dwyer,"Now that I've convinced you, why don't we go dance?"
April Ludgate,"Um, I'm gonna go to the girls' bathroom to check the trash cans for babies, but you can dance if you want."
Andy Dwyer,Really?
Andy Dwyer,I love you!
Andy Dwyer,Thank you!
Music,Money's the motivation money's the conversation you on vacation we gettin' paid so
Extra,"Uh, hey, no one's really feeling this."
Tom Haverford,"All right, not a 2 Chainz crowd."
Tom Haverford,I'll throw on some yeezy in a second.
Tom Haverford,Jeezy?
Tom Haverford,Weezy?
Tom Haverford,Oh!
Tom Haverford,You want some of that classic stuff.
Tom Haverford,"All right, I'll break you off some of that Ja Rule."
Extra,Who's Ja Rule?
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,How do you wha-- who's what?
Extra,"The stuff you're playing is so old, it's probably trinking on grizzledump."
Tom Haverford,"Hey, what's grizzledump?"
Tom Haverford,And why is trinking on it bad?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."
Tom Haverford,I don't know what's cool anymore.
Tom Haverford,"What's grizzledump, Ben?"
Tom Haverford,What's grizzledump?
Music,"This moment, we own it"
Leslie Knope,So have you ever pulled a ceremonial cord before?
Leslie Knope,There's a little trick to it.
Leslie Knope,"You want to hold it not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake and then move towards the ground in a rope pulling motion."
Allison,So just pull the rope?
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Allison,"Thanks, Leslie, for this, and for making prom happen in the first place."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, you don't have to thank me."
Leslie Knope,Working for the government is its own reward--
Leslie Knope,"Run, Allison, run."
Ron Swanson,"You're wasting your time, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Allison and I already had a good talk about the power of the hard earned dollar.
Leslie Knope,Don't listen to him.
Leslie Knope,"Now, when you pull the rope, don't look at the balloons."
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces of the people as the balloons drop.
Leslie Knope,That's what government is about.
Leslie Knope,Look at the faces.
Ron Swanson,"No, look at the cage that is holding all of those balloons."
Ron Swanson,"I assembled that cage and was paid for my labor, and I will use the money to buy shelter, fuel, and medicine."
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.
Leslie Knope,Pull the rope.
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces.
Ron Swanson,Watch the cage.
Leslie Knope,Watch the faces!
Allison,"Uh, erm…"
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You've ruined prom.
Leslie Knope,Everybody's having a terrible time.
Donna Meagle,I didn't go to my prom.
Donna Meagle,I was dating an older fella back then.
Donna Meagle,Like I'm gonna dance with a bunch of kids while he's coaching Duke to the final four.
April Ludgate,"I just want to go home, but I feel bad because Andy's having such a good time."
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
April Ludgate,How can I love someone when I hate everything he loves?
Donna Meagle,That's not true.
Donna Meagle,"He loves a lot of dumb stuff, but he loves you the most."
Donna Meagle,"If something's bothering you, just tell him."
Donna Meagle,It's always better to be direct.
Extra,"Hey, girl."
Extra,Are you ready to go?
Donna Meagle,I feel like I told you to wait in the car.
Extra,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,See?
Donna Meagle,Be direct.
Ron Swanson,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Ron Swanson,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,"You're finished, Knope."
Ron Swanson,"I just spoke with Tim Hautner from the sawmill on my mobile telephone, and he's offering Allison a paying job."
Ron Swanson,She'll be assistant to the head mulcher.
Ron Swanson,Beat that.
Leslie Knope,"First of all, your telephone is ridiculous."
Leslie Knope,"And second of all, I already beat it."
Leslie Knope,She's gonna take that internship.
Leslie Knope,She pulled the rope.
Leslie Knope,There's no turning back!
Principal Russell,Leslie.
Principal Russell,Mr. Swanson.
Principal Russell,May I see both of you in my office?
Principal Russell,Now.
Principal Russell,It has come to my attention that both of you have been harassing Allison about her summer employment decisions.
Leslie Knope,"I wouldn't say ""harassing"" so much as persistently tormenting."
Principal Russell,"I am disappointed in you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Don't be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,I've never had a principal or a teacher be disappointed in me.
Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that I'm equipped to handle it.
Principal Russell,Whatever's going on between you two and Allison ends right now.
Principal Russell,This is supposed to be a fun event for the kids.
Ron Swanson,"You're absolutely right, and I will bow out immediately."
Principal Russell,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,"I think the only thing that matters is whatever Apluses may or may not have been handed out, you know, are still in effect in perpetuity."
Principal Russell,"I have your word, then."
Principal Russell,This ends now?
Leslie Knope,Absolutely.
Leslie Knope,"Attention, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Now it is time for the most magical moment of any high school prom: The announcement of the winner of the Parks and Recreation's coveted summer internship.
Leslie Knope,"Without further ado, help me congratulate Allison Gliffert!"
Leslie Knope,Can we get a little music here maybe?
Tom Haverford,Probably just ruin the moment with something lame.
Allison,"Leslie, I told you."
Allison,I don't know what I'm doing this summer.
Leslie Knope,That's okay.
Leslie Knope,I know what you're doing.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna take this internship.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna fall in love with public service.
Leslie Knope,You're gonna rise through the ranks.
Leslie Knope,You'll take over Ron's job as parks director.
Leslie Knope,"You'll win a seat in congress, and then you and I will run against each other as president, but right before we find out who won, I'm gonna pat you on the back and say, ""It's your turn, kid."""
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, children."
Ron Swanson,Forget this happened.
Ron Swanson,Continue with your awkward close quarters gyrating.
Leslie Knope,"And if this is the evening you decide to have sex, use protection, please!"
Ben Wyatt," Dude, if you're not gonna play anything, I'm stepping in."
Tom Haverford, Go ahead.
Tom Haverford, Play whatever you want.
Tom Haverford, Can't be any worse than this.
Extra," Hey, I love this song!"
Tom Haverford,You actually like this?
Extra,"Yeah, dude, it's classic rock."
Ben Wyatt," Well, there's more where that came from, snoopies!"
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt, Tried to use slang.
Ben Wyatt, That just came out.
Extra, I only listen to CDs.
Extra, It's the way music like this was meant to be heard.
Tom Haverford, But it's not even auto-tuned.
Extra, Where'd you get that dress?
April Ludgate,I was buried in it.
Andy Dwyer," Babe, huge news."
Andy Dwyer, I just got us invited to Damian Keating's barn party.
Andy Dwyer," He's captain of the soccer team, and he has a fake I.D."
Andy Dwyer,So I think he can get us all free beer.
Andy Dwyer, What's wrong? There's cupcakes and music.
Andy Dwyer, Why aren't you having fun?
April Ludgate,"Because this prom reminds me that you had, like, a million friends in high school and everyone thought you were awesome, and I spent four years making fun of everyone and hiding mops so the janitor would think he was going insane."
April Ludgate," If we went to high school together, we would have never started dating, which means that we would have never gotten married, and I don't like thinking about that."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, maybe we wouldn't have gotten together if we were in high school."
Andy Dwyer, But that's because kids in high school are idiots.
Andy Dwyer," The only thing that matters is that we found each other right now, and it's the best."
Andy Dwyer, You know what?
Andy Dwyer,Let's bail.
Andy Dwyer, We got that limo for three more hours.
Andy Dwyer, I think the extra length could help us get us over that lake.
April Ludgate, No.
April Ludgate, Let's stay.
April Ludgate, I'll have fun.
April Ludgate, I promise.
Ron Swanson," I have never told you this, but I actually have a ten-point scale for how insane you are being."
Ron Swanson," I observe your behavior, and if it's a five or below, I say nothing."
Leslie Knope, Smart.
Leslie Knope, Saves a lot of time.
Ron Swanson," If it reaches a six, like for example the incident with the girls' soccer uniforms back in '05…"
Leslie Knope,They wrote all the team names in pink.
Leslie Knope, Nobody told them to do that.
Ron Swanson, I try to steer you back to safety.
Ron Swanson, A seven is when I lock you in your office until you cool down.
Ron Swanson, This Allison Gliffert thing may have hit an eight.
Ron Swanson, I have the police on standby.
Ron Swanson, It's your move.
Leslie Knope," I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee, moving to Chicago."
Leslie Knope, I just need to make sure that the future is secure around here when I leave.
Leslie Knope," You know? Allison would become April, and then April would become me."
Leslie Knope," I mean, let's face it, Ron."
Leslie Knope," I love you, but you're hopeless without me."
Ron Swanson, Blueprints for the future are a fool's errand.
Ron Swanson, They're like blueprints for a house.
Ron Swanson," Nice to have, but any foreman with half a brain doesn't need to look at them."
Ron Swanson," One day, this year or maybe the next, you're gonna be somewhere else."
Ron Swanson, So enjoy yourself now.
Leslie Knope, Damn it.
Leslie Knope, I just wish once you would say something stupid so I could ignore it.
Principal Russell," Attention, please."
Principal Russell, The votes are in.
Principal Russell, And your Pawnee high prom king and queen are…
Principal Russell,Lucy Taylor and Andy Dwyer!
Andy Dwyer,What?
April Ludgate,"I broke the box, and I threw away all the votes, and I voted for you a thousand times."
April Ludgate," You should get on up there, King Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer, Not without my queen.
Andy Dwyer," Hi, Pawnee High."
Andy Dwyer," As your prom king, I'm your ruler."
Andy Dwyer," Silence! My first decree of power is to declare that the prom queen shall be my wife, April Ludgate, who is the best thing that's ever happened to me who came to prom even though she hates it."
Andy Dwyer, Give me this.
Andy Dwyer, Always next year.
Extra," No, there isn't."
Extra, I'm a senior.
Principal Russell, This is your wife? How old are you?
April Ludgate,"He's 33, and I'm 47/immortal."
Principal Russell, Get out.
Andy Dwyer, High school forever!
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, you're having fun now."
Andy Dwyer, I rigged an election and got kicked out of prom.
Andy Dwyer, I can get on board with that.
Tom Haverford,My life is over.
Tom Haverford, I'm officially old and uncool.
Tom Haverford, Might as well start wearing a plaid shirt and a tie and khakis and whatever shoes you're wearing.
Ben Wyatt," Look, the fact that you don't know what high schoolers are into doesn't make you uncool."
Ben Wyatt, It makes you a normal human adult.
Ben Wyatt," You haven't had time to keep up 'cause the last few years, you started two different businesses."
Tom Haverford, I guess that's true.
Tom Haverford, Richard Branson and Mark Cuban are too busy making deals to keep up with what the kids are into.
Tom Haverford, How else do you explain their terrible haircuts?
Ben Wyatt,"And, hey, you may be old, but you'll never be as old as me."
Tom Haverford, Yeah.
Tom Haverford, You're old as [bleep].
Tom Haverford," Thanks, Ben."
Ben Wyatt, Glad I could help.
Leslie Knope,"Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas."
Leslie Knope," You just have so much promise, we got excited."
Leslie Knope, You're a good kid.
Leslie Knope," And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it."
Allison, I have to say I admire you both.
Allison," You were right, Leslie."
Allison," Watching all those happy faces, it felt amazing."
Allison, But it was really nice to build something and get paid for it.
Leslie Knope," Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful and grounded."
Leslie Knope," Get her away from me, or I'm gonna kidnap her and try to mentor her to death."
Allison," Oh, let me introduce you to my boyfriend."
Leslie Knope, Greg Pikitis.
Greg Pikitis," What up, Knope?"
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Gregory."
Allison, You guys know each other?
Leslie Knope,You might say that.
Greg Pikitis," Come on, baby."
Greg Pikitis, Let's get out of here.
Ron Swanson," That's that horrible kid who used to prank us all the time, right?"
Leslie Knope,Offer is off the table.
Leslie Knope, She's a terrible person with terrible judgment.
Leslie Knope, Pikitis!

Andy Dwyer,"I'd have to check, but I'm pretty sure we can handle that."
Andy Dwyer,I do have one question.
Andy Dwyer,Hold on.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Andy!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my Sorry."
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Are you getting sick?
Leslie Knope,"It's flu season again, and I cannot get sick."
Leslie Knope,Stock up on Kleenex.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch your face.
Leslie Knope,Don't touch anything.
Leslie Knope,People are dropping like flies.
Leslie Knope,We already had to quarantine Larry.
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I don't feel good."
Jerry Gergich,Can't I just work from home?
Leslie Knope,"The tent is your home now, Larry."
Leslie Knope,We already forwarded your mail.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, well, here's something that's going to make you feel really good."
Andy Dwyer,Guess who I just secured as the headliner for the Unity Concert.
Andy Dwyer,Chipp McCapp!
Leslie Knope,No!
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Leslie Knope,Nice!
Leslie Knope,"Wait, no, I don't want to touch your hand."
Leslie Knope,Chipp McCapp is the most amazing  17 year old country singer in the entire world.
Leslie Knope,He's like Indiana's sweetheart.
Andy Dwyer,We are huge Chippmunks.
Andy Dwyer,That's what his fans call themselves.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know why.
Andy Dwyer,Chippmunks.
Andy Dwyer,Because of the animal?
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's too simple."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"His latest song, Beautiful Like My Mom  parentheses Support the Troops has, like, two million hits on YouTube."
Chipp McCapp,"She don't care about no fancy trends She's just a mom from old South Bend Get home safe, boys, and thank you for protecting our freedom."
Andy Dwyer,Let's play it again.
Leslie Knope,Play it again.
Tom Haverford,"Today at a local vineyard, a bunch of sommeliers, AKA wine experts, are going to be competing for their certification."
Tom Haverford,I'm going to hire the best one at my new restaurant.
Tom Haverford,Tom's Bistro.
Tom Haverford,People that convince other people  to buy expensive stuff they don't need.
Tom Haverford,Those are the real heroes.
Tom Haverford,Donna.
Tom Haverford,April.
Tom Haverford,Wine Country train is leaving the station.
Tom Haverford,You ready?
Craig Middlebrooks,I want to come.
Craig Middlebrooks,I love wine and everything about it.
Craig Middlebrooks,"The soil, the vines."
Craig Middlebrooks,I studied botany for three years  at Purdue University.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Go, Boilermakers!"
Ron Swanson,"There will be alcohol there, so I will go, as well."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, maybe I'll tag along."
Ben Wyatt,I don't have anymore work to do.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe it will be relaxing.
Tom Haverford,I didn't invite any of you.
Tom Haverford,I started with two cool people  and I ended up with a bunch of grandpas.
Tom Haverford,"Listen, grandpas."
Tom Haverford,"When we get to the vineyard,  there'll be a lot of fancy people there."
Tom Haverford,"Please, I beg you, don't embarrass me."
Ben Wyatt,How would we embarrass you?
Tom Haverford,You're already doing it.
Tom Haverford,I begged you.
Andy Dwyer,"I guess, now that we've got Chipp McCapp as our headliner,  I can get rid of my awesome wish list."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, those are long shots."
Leslie Knope,"""Bob Dylan's friends?"""
Andy Dwyer,I just thought maybe they could get Bob Dylan to come.
Leslie Knope,Land Ho.
Leslie Knope,"God, I love them."
Leslie Knope,Everybody does.
Leslie Knope,But there's no way they're getting back together.
Leslie Knope,Their lead singer split 10 years ago.
Leslie Knope,He titled their last album We'll Never Reunite.
Jerry Gergich,Leslie?
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Back in your tent, sicky."
Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, but Chipp McCapp's manager called."
Jerry Gergich,He has to drop out.
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we need all hands on deck."
Leslie Knope,There are no hands to be on deck  because everybody's at the winery.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, you and I need to handle this."
Leslie Knope,We need to be operating at maximum
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Larry!"
Jerry Gergich,Sorry.
Tom Haverford,"Xander, my mander."
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Owner, operator, and global ambassador for Tom's Bistro, opening this spring in Pawnee."
Xander,It's a pleasure to meet you.
Donna Meagle,Damn.
Donna Meagle,Look at that tie dimple.
Donna Meagle,Respect.
Tom Haverford,My main target for Tom's Bistro?
Tom Haverford,Xander Truffant.
Tom Haverford,He's the best young somm in the game.
Tom Haverford,I don't say this lightly.
Tom Haverford,He's basically the Bruno Mars of Indiana amateur wine tasting.
Xander,"If you'll excuse me, I must prepare for the tasting competition."
Xander,I pour saline water through my nose  to clear the mucus from my smell centers.
Tom Haverford,That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,It costs 200 dollars to get certified.
April Ludgate,I wanted to make fun of stupid people while I get drunk.
April Ludgate,My two true passions.
Donna Meagle,You want to futz with these fools?
Donna Meagle,I will bankroll you.
April Ludgate,Really?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, yeah, pimp."
Donna Meagle,Sounds like fun.
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"April Ludgate, professional drinker."
Extra,"Uh, where did you study, Ms. Ludgate?"
April Ludgate,The Wine Academy.
Extra,The Wine Academy?
Extra,In Bordeaux?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Extra,"Carol, make sure she's in Group A."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Uh, excuse me."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I want in, too."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I know I don't look the part,  but I know everything about wine and I will prove it."
Craig Middlebrooks,"My name is Craig Middlebrooks,  and this is my debit rewards card."
Ben Wyatt,"Why wouldn't you run this by me first, Dad?"
Ben Wyatt,Whatever.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, just weird family business."
Ron Swanson,Sounds private.
Ron Swanson,No need to discuss it with me.
Ben Wyatt,"My parents had this small, little vacation house on Lake Hubbard."
Ben Wyatt,"And now, they've sold it without telling the rest of us."
Ron Swanson,Did you not hear me say there was no need to discuss it with me?
Ben Wyatt,My dad sent me this check out of the blue.
Ben Wyatt,My share of the profits.
Ben Wyatt,It's so disrespectful to the family structure--
Ron Swanson,Maybe a drink will help.
Ron Swanson,Put some alcohol in your mouth to block the words from coming out.
Extra,Some of our blueberry wine?
Extra,We make it right here at the vineyard.
Ron Swanson,I don't drink alcohol from that portion of the color spectrum.
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,"Whoa, that's strong."
Ben Wyatt,"Holy hell, that's a lot of alcohol."
Ron Swanson,"We will take four bottles, please, and thank you."
Leslie Knope,"All we need to do is go to Indianapolis, convince Chipp to do the festival and then, you know, head home."
Andy Dwyer,"Are you sure you're feeling up for this, boss?"
Leslie Knope,I'm fine.
Leslie Knope,"I've had the flu before, and I worked through it."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, if you do collapse, luckily, I know first aid."
Andy Dwyer,Or karate.
Leslie Knope,That's not first aid.
Andy Dwyer,It is if you do it right.
Andy Dwyer,Heimlich!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I guess while you get your medicine, I'll just stroll through the candy aisles, but won't get any."
Leslie Knope,You can buy two candies.
Andy Dwyer,Two?
Extra,Can I help you?
Leslie Knope,I have the flu.
Leslie Knope,"Supernauseated for a few days, a lot of barfing."
Leslie Knope,It's a total disaster.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, I have a ton of work to do, so I need the good stuff."
Leslie Knope,The Mariah needs to sing tonight stuff.
Extra,"You don't look flushed, no signs of fever."
Extra,That just doesn't seem like the flu.
Leslie Knope,It's the flu.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I don't think it could be anything…"
Andy Dwyer,This counts as one.
Ben Wyatt,I'm so mad at my parents.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, they both wanted the house for Columbus Day weekend,  and they fought so much, they decided to just sell it to spite each other."
Ron Swanson,"More wine, less talking."
Ben Wyatt,"You know, you are a wonderful guy,  and I admire many things about you."
Ben Wyatt,But you're a terrible person to discuss personal problems with.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, friend."
Ron Swanson,That really means a lot to me.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Pumpkin, undertones of lavender."
Craig Middlebrooks,Medium plus body.
Craig Middlebrooks,It's mostly pumpkin.
Craig Middlebrooks,"There's so much pumpkin, it's like a Charlie Brown Halloween special."
April Ludgate,"I'm getting notes of dried robin's blood, old, dirty cashews and just a hint of a robot's bathwater."
Xander,An old world wine.
Xander,Italian.
Xander,Ah.
Xander,"It's a Verdicchio Doc Classico, 2010."
Craig Middlebrooks,It's new world.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Northern California, Napa Valley."
Craig Middlebrooks,Some place beautiful and warm and amazing  where everyone is in great shape and the night sky is full of stars!
April Ludgate,This comes from your mother's butt.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, you were in the bathroom forever."
Andy Dwyer,The receptionist said that Chipp will be out in just a second.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, I just need a minute."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to call Ben about nothing.
Ben Wyatt,My parents make me so mad sometimes.
Ben Wyatt,"Just like the time they couldn't decide who gets the dog, so they just dropped it off at the local synagogue."
Ben Wyatt,"I was, like, ""Say what?"""
Ben Wyatt,"Hold on, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,Hold that thought.
Ben Wyatt,Just for a sec.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, honey."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,It's your me.
Leslie Knope,It's wife.
Ben Wyatt,It's Leslie.
Ben Wyatt,Knope.

Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Phone water.
Leslie Knope,Ben?
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,Leslie?
Ben Wyatt,It's dead.
Leslie Knope,Hello?
Ben Wyatt,"You know, Leslie sounded weird."
Ben Wyatt,I don't want to wait for Tom.
Ben Wyatt,I want to walk home.
Ron Swanson,I'll join you.
Ron Swanson,I'm always game for a brisk walk.
Ron Swanson,"Also, if I leave you alone, I'm pretty sure you'll die."
Ben Wyatt,Home is that way.
Ben Wyatt,Watch out for that fence.
Xander,"Ah, Mister Haverford."
Xander,Allow me to introduce Terrence Montreaux.
Xander,He is a restaurateur like yourself.
Tom Haverford,"You own a restaurant, too?"
Terrence Montreaux,"No, monsieur."
Terrence Montreaux,I own 12.
Terrence Montreaux,"I am here to find the best sommeliers as soon as they are,  how you say, certified."
Tom Haverford,That was my idea.
Terrence Montreaux,That is everyone's idea.
Terrence Montreaux,"That is why we have this, how do you say, thing."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, don't act like you don't know the word ""thing."""
Craig Middlebrooks,"With a filet mignon, I'd recommend a red."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Something bold and dry, like David Sedaris."
Extra,Perhaps you could recommend a Riesling instead.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Not if you're eating steak, you loon."
April Ludgate,"You know in the movies, when the cops show up  and they find lipstick on a wine glass next to a dead body?"
April Ludgate,This is that wine.
Chipp McCapp,I'll bring the girls You bring the beer  And the troops will bring the freedom
Leslie Knope,"We're sorry to interrupt, Chipp."
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,We just wanted to say we are such big fans.
Leslie Knope,It's an honor to meet you.
Chipp McCapp,Yeah.
Chipp McCapp,"Well, I'm very blessed."

Chipp McCapp,You're the real superstars.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Chipp McCapp,Can somebody give me one of those LunchStacks?
Chipp McCapp,And stack them for me this time.
Chipp McCapp,"Cheese on top, or no one gets paid."
Extra,"You got it, Chipp."
Chipp McCapp,That's my dad.
Chipp McCapp,Guy's such an idiot.
Andy Dwyer,We wanted to talk to you about the Unity Concert in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,Can you do it?
Chipp McCapp,Yeah.
Chipp McCapp,"Uh, no."
Chipp McCapp,"I'm sorry, I got a previous engagement."
Chipp McCapp,It's a bummer.
Chipp McCapp,Oh.

Chipp McCapp,Look at that.
Chipp McCapp,The cheese is on top.
Chipp McCapp,Of turkey.
Chipp McCapp,You dick.
Chipp McCapp,I want ham.
Extra,"Sorry, son."
Extra,They were out of ham.
Chipp McCapp,"All right, well, maybe I should just let Mom be manager, then?"
Chipp McCapp,"Pick them up, Skipp."
Andy Dwyer,Ew!
Andy Dwyer,This guy's the worst.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, it sucks that they didn't have ham."
Andy Dwyer,But you can't treat your dad like that.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,He's a monster.
Leslie Knope,But we need him.
Chipp McCapp,"Your job's not that hard, okay?"
Chipp McCapp,Just anticipate my needs.
Extra,"Anticipating, Chipp."
Extra,"Of the 25 entrants today,  only one has deemed himself worthy of a sommelier certificate."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Are you sure?
April Ludgate,No way.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Thank you so much, everyone."
April Ludgate,I think we can agree that all wine tastes the same.
April Ludgate,"And if you spend more than $5 on wine, you are very stupid."
Extra,Security.
April Ludgate,I just want to thank all the people that got me here.
April Ludgate,"Norbit, uh, Pluto Nash, all the Klumps."
Extra,"Congratulations to the next Indiana Master Sommelier,  Xander Truffant."
Tom Haverford,I've got to go talk to Xander before Terrence gets to him.
Tom Haverford,Cover me.
Donna Meagle,Got you.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my goodness."
Terrence Montreaux,Mon dieu!
Terrence Montreaux,Qu'est-ce qui se passe?
Donna Meagle,"Oh, je suis desole, monsieur."
Donna Meagle,"Allons-y, allons-y."
Tom Haverford,Xander.
Xander,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,Look.
Tom Haverford,"Tom's Bistro is going to be the dopest, quite possibly trillest restaurant in the area."
Tom Haverford,What do you say?
Tom Haverford,You want to work with me?
Xander,"Thank you, but I've already accepted an offer from Monsieur Montreaux."
Tom Haverford,I'll double whatever he's paying you.
Xander,"You'll pay me $500,000 a year?"
Tom Haverford,I will pay you one-tenth of whatever he's paying you.
Xander,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,"Aw, man, this wine bottle is all out of the wine."
Ron Dunn,"Well, hello, gentlemen."
Ron Dunn,What brings you out on this fine evening?
Ron Swanson,Mother [bleep].
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ben Wyatt,Where'd you come from?
Ron Dunn,"Uh, that's a complicated question."
Ron Dunn,All depends on whether your conception of time is linear or circular.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ron Dunn,"Hello, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Ron.
Ben Wyatt,You know this hobo?
Ron Swanson,He was my counterpart from the Eagleton Parks Department.
Ben Wyatt,Dude.
Ben Wyatt,Are you a ghost?
Ron Dunn,Am I?
Ben Wyatt,What is happening right now?
Leslie Knope,We know that you have that important other engagement--
Chipp McCapp,"Yo, I gots to get that haircut."
Chipp McCapp,Snip!
Leslie Knope,It's not just Pawnee that needs you.
Leslie Knope,It's the entire region.
Extra,"Permission to speak, son?"
Extra,Pawnee is kind of the gateway to that whole region.
Extra,They do buy a lot of albums.
Chipp McCapp,They sure ain't buying toothpaste.
Chipp McCapp,Bunch of dirty hicks.
Chipp McCapp,"What if we fly me in and out same day,  so I wouldn't have to spend a night in your crap town?"
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,Pawnee is a good town.
Leslie Knope,With good people from all walks of life.
Leslie Knope,"Plus, it is an amazing place to raise kids and start a family."
Chipp McCapp,You think I care about that?
Chipp McCapp,Look.
Chipp McCapp,I can do whatever I want.
Chipp McCapp,All right?
Chipp McCapp,"If I want to shoot a paintball gun at my dad, I'm going to do it."
Extra,"Good shot, son."
Extra,I'm proud of you.
Leslie Knope,You're crazy.
Leslie Knope,This is over.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,Pawnee does not need you.
Leslie Knope,"And you should know that, when you shook my hand earlier,  there was pee on my palms."
Leslie Knope,That makes us sound like hicks.
Leslie Knope,We're not.
Leslie Knope,Shut up.
Leslie Knope,Stupid.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Let's go, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,You know what?
Andy Dwyer,That was awesome.
Andy Dwyer,You were great.
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were going to punch that kid's lights out.
Leslie Knope,It was not awesome.
Leslie Knope,"I lost our headliner, I can't stop throwing up, and Ben has not called me back yet."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.
Leslie Knope,There's just a lot of things going on right now.
Leslie Knope,Personal things that I can't talk to you about.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, Leslie, sometimes life throws us crazy curves."
Andy Dwyer,"And yes, this moment may be the biggest curve you've ever had to deal with."
Andy Dwyer,But just because your family is getting bigger does not mean that you can't handle it.
Andy Dwyer,You and Ben can handle anything.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, thank you."
Leslie Knope,That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.
Leslie Knope,"God, it's so weird that you know that I'm pregnant before Ben does."
Andy Dwyer,Pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,Holy crap!
Andy Dwyer,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,What did you think?
Andy Dwyer,I thought you were getting a dog.
Leslie Knope,Why did you go like this?
Andy Dwyer,That's a sign for petting a dog that's sitting on your lap.
Andy Dwyer,Pregnant?
Andy Dwyer,Wow.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that's amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, I think we need to focus on the fact that we have lost our headliner."
Leslie Knope,We are out of options.
Leslie Knope,It's time for a Hail Mary.
Leslie Knope,How are we going to convince this guy to reunite Land Ho?
Andy Dwyer,Same way I got a perfect score on the SATs.
Andy Dwyer,Broken Scantron machine.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, wait."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, that is not a good strategy, okay?"
Leslie Knope,I will give him a brief explanation about the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,And you stand by.
Andy Dwyer,Stand by.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
Scott Tanner,Hello?
Andy Dwyer,Scott Tanner.
Andy Dwyer,It's Scott Tanner.
Andy Dwyer,"Uh, hi."
Andy Dwyer,My name's Andy.
Andy Dwyer,And this barfing lady over here is Leslie.
Andy Dwyer,We just need 10 minutes of your time.
Scott Tanner,To do what?
Andy Dwyer,To convince you to reunite Land Ho.
Scott Tanner,"Listen, it means a lot to me that you guys loved the band."
Scott Tanner,And I'm going to tell you the exact same thing  I've told everyone who has ever asked us to reunite.
Scott Tanner,No.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, I know that you and the band aren't on the best of terms right now."
Andy Dwyer,But bringing people together is exactly what we want to talk to you about.
Andy Dwyer,Hold that.
Andy Dwyer,Hold that down at the bottom.
Ben Wyatt,Mr. Ron Dunn.
Ben Wyatt,I have something I'm very angry about.
Ben Wyatt,"But other Ron, he's not helping me with it."
Ben Wyatt,Can you help?
Ron Dunn,I can tell by the indigo on your Chiclet that you've been drinking blueberry wine.
Ron Dunn,That's a good start.
Ron Dunn,"The Wamapoke called it ""mattapiqua."""
Ron Dunn,They believed it had mystical powers.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it also tastes like jelly."
Ron Dunn,"So, what's got your goat there, friend?"
Ben Wyatt,"My parents, they had this lake house  and they sold it without telling me."
Ben Wyatt,"And so, I was like, ""Why?"
Ben Wyatt,"""You know?"""
Ben Wyatt,"I was like, ""God!"""
Ben Wyatt,You guys!
Ron Dunn,Oh.
Ron Dunn,"You're hanging onto that anger for dear life, compadre."
Ron Dunn,Let's role play.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, goodnight, everyone."
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm going to go home and feel totally fine.
Craig Middlebrooks,Who am I kidding?
Craig Middlebrooks,"I'm going to go home,  put on a Macy Gray album, and cry in the mirror!"
Donna Meagle,Why are you bummed?
Craig Middlebrooks,Are you all blind?
Craig Middlebrooks,I want that job at Tom's Bistro.
Craig Middlebrooks,I've been trying to show you for the last five hours.
Tom Haverford,"Look, man, you know your stuff,  but you're like a crazy volcano."
Tom Haverford,You'd have to show me you can bring it down a notch.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I'll bring it down 1,000 notches if I have to!"
Scott Tanner,This looks like it's going to be a great concert.
Scott Tanner,The band just does not play anymore.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I understand."
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Um, I'm sorry."
Leslie Knope,My stomach is trying to murder me.
Scott Tanner,You still drunk from last night?
Scott Tanner,I've been there.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, this town still loves you."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm in a band myself, actually."
Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.
Andy Dwyer,And we cover about five of your songs and they just go nuts.
Scott Tanner,Really? Which ones?
Andy Dwyer,"Catapult me into the Sun, and I'll burn, baby, burn."
Scott Tanner,"  Oh, yeah."
Extra,Johnny Karate.
Scott Tanner,I thought you said your name was Andy.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it is."
Andy Dwyer,I'm also a children's performer.
Extra,He played at Joey's birthday and he's awesome.
Extra,Sing Karate Chop Master.
Andy Dwyer,I'll do it as long as your dad sings along.
Scott Tanner, Let's do it.
Andy Dwyer,It's easy.
Andy Dwyer,"
You'll pick it up."
Andy Dwyer,"Karate chop master I'm a karate chop master  And I will karate chop you Chop, chop, chop, chop Kick, kick, kick, kick, chop"
Andy Dwyer,"Scott, you sing."
Scott Tanner,"  Chop, chop, kick, kick Kick, kick, kick, kick, chop"
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer, Just listen to me.
Andy Dwyer,  Chop and a chop and a kick-kick-kick-kick chop  And tighten the throat And chop-a-kick chop
Andy Dwyer,"Now, your turn."
Scott Tanner,"  Chop, chop, kick, kick, chop "
Andy Dwyer,"Harmony! Oh, my God!"
Andy Dwyer,"Chop, chop, kick Chop, kick-kick-kick  And a chop and a kick and a kick and a  No."
Andy Dwyer, No.
Andy Dwyer, It's not-- You didn't-- I mean-- Just listen.
Craig Middlebrooks,  Good evening.
Craig Middlebrooks, May I assist you with a wine tonight? 
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford," I'm having fish, so maybe a full-bodied red?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"You know, sir, you might want to consider  something white to go with your fish."
Donna Meagle,  No.
Donna Meagle, Red.
Donna Meagle, And bring some ice cubes.
Donna Meagle, I like ice cubes in my red wine.
April Ludgate," I'll have a glass of your most expensive red wine  mixed with a glass of your cheapest white wine,  served in a dog bowl."
April Ludgate,"  And silly straws all around, please."
Craig Middlebrooks,  I'll be right back with my recommendations.
Tom Haverford,  He seems to be keeping it together.
Craig Middlebrooks,"What kind of monster orders red with fish?  I know they're messing with me and it's just a test, but have some decency!"
Craig Middlebrooks,"For you, sir, a light, crisp Pinot with just a hint of lemon  to bring out the flavors in your fish."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I brought you a bold Cabernet, which should still taste okay when watered down."
Craig Middlebrooks,"And for you, madam, would you consider this rose?"
Craig Middlebrooks,It's halfway between red and white.
Tom Haverford,  Thanks very much.
Craig Middlebrooks, Enjoy.
Tom Haverford,  I think I may have found my new sommelier.
Craig Middlebrooks, That was so embarrassing!
Tom Haverford,We'll have to make sure the wine cellar at Tom's Bistro is soundproof.
Ron Dunn,That was beautiful.
Ron Dunn,You're surrendering to the Earth Mother.
Ron Dunn," Now, stare into the fire and picture your spirit animal."
Ben Wyatt,I don't know what my spirit animal is.
Ron Swanson,Because it doesn't exist because that's nonsense because you're an adult.
Ron Dunn,Baby snow owl.
Ben Wyatt, He's right.
Ron Dunn, Our spirit animals connect us to the natural world.
Ron Dunn,You need to remain open to their message.
Ron Dunn,Watch.
Ron Dunn,"Welcome back, old friend."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa.
Ron Dunn,"If you really want to cleanse yourself of that anger,  take that check and send it into the flames."
Ron Dunn, And up into the air with your screams.
Ron Swanson,Do not burn that check.
Ron Swanson, It is money.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt," Ron is right, Ron."
Ron Dunn,"There, there, baby snow owl."
Ron Dunn,  You're safe now.
Ron Swanson,This is him right here.
Ron Swanson, I'll also get out here and walk home.
Ron Dunn,  You sure?  This thing runs on vegetable oil and bat guano.
Ron Dunn,  Actually cleans the air as it drives.
Ron Swanson,  Quite sure.
Ron Swanson, Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,  Hey.
Ben Wyatt,  Thank you for helping me with my anger.
Ron Dunn,You've already emerged from your cocoon.
Ron Dunn,"Now the question is, will you fly?"
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I don't feel any better."
Ben Wyatt, I'm still angry.
Ben Wyatt,  Damn it.
Ben Wyatt,  I don't know why this lake house thing is driving me so crazy.
Ron Swanson,  Sorry we couldn't help you work through your problems.
Ron Swanson,"  Now, if you'll excuse me,  I've got a lady, two little girls,  and an infant waiting for me."
Ron Swanson,  It's always nice to see the kids at the end of a long day.
Ron Swanson,  Really puts things in perspective.
Leslie Knope,"  Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope," Ben, I have so much to tell you."
Leslie Knope,  We got Land Ho to play the Unity Concert.
Leslie Knope,"  Whoa, what happened to you?"
Ben Wyatt,It doesn't matter.
Ben Wyatt,  I thought I was upset because my parents are insane.
Ben Wyatt,  But Ron kind of just showed me the real reason.
Ben Wyatt,"  I have so many childhood memories at that lake house  that, in the back of my mind, I always pictured taking my kids-- or taking our kids there."
Ben Wyatt,I want to start our family.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, I know things are crazy, but there's no good time."
Ben Wyatt,  And I want to do it.
Ben Wyatt, Now.
Leslie Knope,"  Well, buddy, I've got some good news for you."

Ben Wyatt,So what do we got so far?
Ben Wyatt,We need big ticket items.
April Ludgate,I got the Red Hot Chili Peppers to send us a signed guitar.
Leslie Knope,"That's great, April."
Leslie Knope,How'd you do that?
Leslie Knope,"It's a long story, but the short version is, I'm currently catfishing Anthony Kiedis."
Leslie Knope,"We're throwing a charity auction to raise money for the unity concert, and we're gonna need it too, if I'm gonna perform Islands In the Stream with a Sacagawea hologram."
Leslie Knope,"Plus, we need lights, generators, microphones, water, that boring stuff too."
Ben Wyatt,Why don't we put a pin in this?
Ben Wyatt,'Cause we have to do that thing.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope,"All right, yep."
Ben Wyatt,"Just, like…"
Leslie Knope,"Everybody, keep working."
Leslie Knope,We'll be back.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, hey, you haven't told anyone about the baby, right?"
Andy Dwyer,"No, but my brain is about to explode from stress."
Andy Dwyer,I am not good at keeping secrets.
Andy Dwyer,That's exactly what I told Kyle when he told me his wife was cheating on him.
Kyle,"Andy, come on!"
Andy Dwyer,Ah!
Andy Dwyer,See?
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Kyle,"Not cool, man."
Andy Dwyer,"Not him, not that Kyle."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, we are going to have a doctor's appointment, and then after that, we can probably tell people."
Leslie Knope,"So just hang in there, please."
Andy Dwyer,I can do this.
Andy Dwyer,People do this.
Andy Dwyer,People keep secrets.
Andy Dwyer,My neighbor Eric he's kept a secret for 20 years.
Andy Dwyer,He's in Witness Protection.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Donna Meagle,You wanted to see me?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,I need to ask you for a favor.
Donna Meagle,What?
Donna Meagle,Ron Swanson asking for help?
Ron Swanson,"Keep your voice down, woman!"
Ron Swanson,Part of the unity concert is a youth revue about the history of Pawnee.
Ron Swanson,"They require volunteers, so I want you to come with me to my daughters' public elementary school to help make costumes."
Donna Meagle,The elementary school?
Donna Meagle,"I'll do you this solid, but you're gonna have to keep an eye out for my ex-boyfriend Joe."
Donna Meagle,"He teaches music at that school, and he is a nightmare."
Donna Meagle,He's my Tammy.
Ron Swanson,Your Tammy?
Ron Swanson,"Donna, my two ex-wives are the worst people in the world."
Ron Swanson,Tammy two once seduced a coroner and had me declared legally dead just so she could get a discount on a plane ticket.
Donna Meagle,"When I'm with Joe, he turns me into a person I don't like or recognize."
Donna Meagle,I go insane.
Donna Meagle,All I'm asking is for you to keep him away from me.
Ron Swanson,I understand this problem well and agree to this exchange of services.
Leslie Knope,"We need to raise a minimum of $30,000 from the auction, or else the concert's gonna be in trouble."
Leslie Knope,What else can we auction off?
Leslie Knope,What about those fish?
Leslie Knope,Think they're valuable?
Leslie Knope,Cover me.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you should start taking it easy.
Ben Wyatt,You're stressing out for two now.
Ben Wyatt,"Hmm, that's actually a pretty decent tshirt idea."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I cannot slow down."
Leslie Knope,The concert is in three weeks.
Leslie Knope,"Look, I feel fine, and if you're worried, we can just ask Dr. Saperstein what he thinks."
Dr. Saperstein,"Someone say ""Saperstein""?"
Dr. Saperstein,"Come on, you two."
Dr. Saperstein,Let's saddle you up and put some jelly on the belly.
Leslie Knope,He's a little weird.
Ben Wyatt,Mmhmm.
Craig Middlebrooks,Look at me!
Andy Dwyer,Jeez.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, here's what's happening-- I want to auction off a personalized Johnny Karate song tomorrow, so I need you to come to the auction."
Andy Dwyer,Auction?
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Let me write that down.
April Ludgate,"Andy, you already have three Johnny Karate shows tomorrow."
Andy Dwyer,"No, not according to my file here."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I forgot, other hand."
Andy Dwyer,Crap.
April Ludgate,"Okay, we need a better system."
April Ludgate,"Look, I'll just write down an itinerary for you, so you can just focus on songs."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, well, you have to catalog all this stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, this is hours' worth of work."
April Ludgate,What is that?
April Ludgate,"""Don't tell secret""?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, that's not one."
April Ludgate,"Andy, if you have a secret, you have to tell me."
April Ludgate,That's the whole point of marriage.
April Ludgate,You get twice the secrets.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, it is nothing."
Andy Dwyer,I don't have anything.
Andy Dwyer,I'm not acting weird.
Andy Dwyer,You're acting weird.
Andy Dwyer,Excuse me.
Andy Dwyer,I have to get back to work now.
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Donna Meagle,I'm getting a picture of you volunteering at a public elementary school in case I ever need to blackmail you.
Donna Meagle,"That's Joe, 12:00."
Joe,"Donna, how are you?"
Joe,It's really nice to see you.
Donna Meagle,Mmhmm.
Joe,Thank you so much for helping out.
Joe,These kids are so lucky to have your fashion expertise.
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Joe."
Ron Swanson,My name is Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,I am Donna's work proximity associate.
Joe,"Oh, my gosh, Donna has told me so much about you."
Joe,It's nice to put a face to the name.
Ron Swanson,Mmhmm.
Joe,"Well, I gotta get back to my classroom."
Joe,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Ron."
Joe,"And if either of you guys need anything at all today, please do not hesitate to ask, okay?"
Ron Swanson,"I'm onto you, friend."
Joe,What?
Ron Swanson,Tread lightly.
Joe,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Now, Ben wants me to slow down, but I have this huge project coming up, and slowing down isn't really my jam."
Dr. Saperstein,"Your body is going through some changes, but you're a healthy gal, right, Leslie?"
Dr. Saperstein,There is no reason for you not to be yourself.
Leslie Knope,I win.
Ben Wyatt,It wasn't a competition.
Dr. Saperstein,All right.
Dr. Saperstein,Let's see what's going down in baby town.
Dr. Saperstein,There's your healthy baby.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Dr. Saperstein,"Oh, and there's another one."
Ben Wyatt,The baby has two bodies?
Leslie Knope,Twins.
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're having twins."
Dr. Saperstein,"No, you're not, 'cause look who's hiding over here."
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Leslie Knope,Triplets?
Dr. Saperstein,And here's a fourth.
Dr. Saperstein,"I'm so sorry, no."
Dr. Saperstein,It's a little fleck of cream cheese on the screen.
Dr. Saperstein,Just triplets.
Dr. Saperstein,"Wow, you guys really dodged a bullet."
Dr. Saperstein,Can you imagine raising four children at one time?
Dr. Saperstein,"Ha, a nightmare."
Ben Wyatt,Triplets.
Leslie Knope,Triplets.
Leslie Knope,I can't believe it.
Leslie Knope,We knocked it out of the park on the first try.
Leslie Knope,"If we do this right, we can be parents to 1/3 of the supreme court!"
Ben Wyatt,This is insane.
Leslie Knope,This is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"I always knew we were one in a million, and now we got the proof!"
Dr. Saperstein,"Well, actually, one in 8,000."
Dr. Saperstein,"Triplets occur a lot more frequently than you imagine,  especially at your age."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Dr. Saperstein,Your body is prone to releasing multiple eggs.
Dr. Saperstein,"It's what we doctors like to call, and I don't mean to be insensitive, a going out of business sale."
Ben Wyatt,"So, doctor, um, what do we like, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Like, what do we do?"
Ben Wyatt,"Um, how do we how how how how what do we do?"
Dr. Saperstein,"The first thing you do is, you forget everything that I said before because you, young lady, need a lot of rest and especially avoiding stress."
Dr. Saperstein,"Leslie, I need you to be Buddha on quaaludes, and, Ben, you are Matthew McConaughey in a hammock on the beach."
Ben Wyatt,"Alright, alright."
Ben Wyatt,Alright.
Ben Wyatt,This is insane.
Ben Wyatt,Three kids?
Ben Wyatt,"I just multiplied all our future expenses by three, and you know what happened?"
Ben Wyatt,The numbers got a lot higher.
Ben Wyatt,I think I heard the computer laugh at me.
Ben Wyatt,And Saperstein wants us to relax?
Leslie Knope,"Are you ready to go, my gentle dove?"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I will be there in two flaps of a butterfly's wing, and I love you."
Ben Wyatt,We are so [bleep] screwed.
Ron Swanson,Uh-oh.
Ron Swanson,"What did you do now, Joe?"
Extra,Thank you so much.
Extra,We thought we were gonna have to tell Dylan that his doggie was gone forever.
Joe,"Oh, my gosh."
Joe,"Barbara, don't even mention it."
Joe,"Look, I hate it when my students are upset, so I just went out, driving around."
Joe,I checked a few neighborhood parks.
Joe,It took barely six hours.
Extra,"Oh, how can we ever repay you?"
Joe,No need.
Joe,Would you like a muffin?
Joe,I made them last night.
Extra,It's the best muffin I've ever had.
Joe,"You're welcome, guys."
Joe,You're welcome.
Joe,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,So whose birthday is it anyway?
Councilman Dexhart,"Oh, who knows?"
Councilman Dexhart,"I got so many kids from different women, I just get all of their birthdays out of the way one day a year."
Councilman Dexhart,Ladies.
April Ludgate,"Okay, so when this ends, we have a half hour to get to the next party."
April Ludgate,"That gives us 15 minutes of travel time, and 15 minutes for you to take a wetnap shower in the car."
Andy Dwyer,"Good, I need one."
April Ludgate,"Also, tell me your secret."
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, don't make me tell."
Andy Dwyer,I don't wanna break my promise.
Andy Dwyer,Tell me now.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, jeez, this is heavy."
Jerry Gergich,Pardon me.
Andy Dwyer,It's about Larry.
Andy Dwyer,He is very sick.
Andy Dwyer,He has some kind of disease.
April Ludgate,"Oh, so that's why you've been so nice to him and let him carry all your stuff."
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, that's the reason."
Andy Dwyer,"Good call, babe."

Craig Middlebrooks,"Leslie, that's less than face value."
Craig Middlebrooks,"You need passion, zeal, showmanship."
Craig Middlebrooks,"I don't have the gavel, so I'm powerless."
Craig Middlebrooks,I respect the hierarchy of the auction!

Ivy Lewis,Ron!
Ivy Lewis,"Ron, play with us!"

Joe,They are great girls.
Joe,You must feel very lucky to be their stepdad.
Ron Swanson,"I do, indeed."
Ron Swanson,"If you'll excuse me, Joe, I have to finish hogging out the cheeks on these lap joints."
Joe,"Oh, maybe you could use this jig I made."
Joe,It's just a hardwood clamping block connected to a small piece of hackberry.
Joe,You could use it to locate your cuts for the inside shoulder
Ron Swanson,Without having to reset the fence.
Joe,Without having to reset the fence.
Joe,Exactly.
Joe,Muffin?
April Ludgate,"Thirsty there, big guy?"
Jerry Gergich,"Well, jeez, yes."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you so much.
Jerry Gergich,Do you remember the time when you put sleeping pills in my soda?
Jerry Gergich,I fell right over in the middle of a town hall meeting.
April Ludgate,"Mm, no."
April Ludgate,I don't remember that.
Jerry Gergich,You made a video of it and showed it at my birthday party.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, it went over really big."
April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate,Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Jerry Gergich,That's very sweet.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, um, I have got an itch that I have not been able to get to all day, and even against the wall, nothing will do it."
Jerry Gergich,Would you mind doing that?
April Ludgate,"No, not at all."
Jerry Gergich,"Just… if you could, like okay, go up."
Jerry Gergich,Go up the back.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben."
Andy Dwyer,Can I just please tell just April?
Andy Dwyer,I am hanging on by a thread over here.
Ben Wyatt,"No, just… look, everyone's healthy and fine, but it's complicated."
Ben Wyatt,There's a lot going on.
Ben Wyatt,"So just don't say anything to anyone about anything forever, okay?"
Ben Wyatt,Andy?
Ben Wyatt,"You can say ""Okay."""
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Bye.
Andy Dwyer,"I didn't mean to say ""Bye."""

Jeremy Jamm,I'll bid 100 bucks.
Leslie Knope,"Anyone want to-- Oh, thank you, madam."
Leslie Knope,A very wealthy and elegant looking woman with a diamond encrusted eye patch just raised her hand.
Leslie Knope,Don't look at her.
Leslie Knope,"She doesn't like attention, but she's there."
Leslie Knope,She's real.
Leslie Knope,"So do I hear 2,000?"
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, yeah, here we go."

Leslie Knope,That is outrageous.
Jeremy Jamm,That's the only bid out there right now.

Ben Wyatt,You want a head massage?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,"So, um, Andy told me what's going on."
Jerry Gergich,Really?
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,I was trying to keep it hush-hush.
Jerry Gergich,It's kind of embarrassing.
April Ludgate,"Well, if you ever need to talk to anyone, I'm here for you."
April Ludgate,"Or, like, you know, I'm here, standing near you."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, earlier today, I was licking icing off of my finger, and then, boom, I swallow my wedding ring."
Jerry Gergich,"And I wish I could say it was the first time, but…"
April Ludgate,"Wait, wait, wait."
April Ludgate,"So you're not, like, dying?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, no, no, I mean, can it be painful?"
Jerry Gergich,"Sure, but the good news is, I've gotten very good at passing it."
Jerry Gergich,It's just a matter of getting out the old colander.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Pearl, jump in."
Leslie Knope,Don't make me pull the permits on your rental units.
Extra,"Hey, all the paperwork on those buildings are under my dog's name, so if you got a problem, take it up with Princess."

Ben Wyatt,"Please, anyone."
Ben Wyatt,"We're just trying to raise some money for this concert,  so no one gets stressed out."
Herman,Fine.
Herman,50 and another win for old Herman.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you erase the signatures?
Herman,I'm more of a Jack Johnson guy.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, give it back."
Herman,"If you want it so bad, bid on it."
Ben Wyatt,I don't like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Ben Wyatt,It's not even the original lineup.
Ben Wyatt,Give it back!
Leslie Knope,Ben!
Ben Wyatt,It's okay.
Ben Wyatt,I'm fine.
Ben Wyatt,Stay relaxed.

Craig Middlebrooks,It just got insane!
Dr. Harris,You have very weak hands.
Ben Wyatt,Why would you say that?
Dr. Harris,Just making an observation.
Leslie Knope,Poor Ben.

Ben Wyatt,"I'm totally fine, babe."
Ben Wyatt,Everything is A-okay coolio beans.
Ben Wyatt,You want to meditate real quick?

Leslie Knope,"He can go, right, Ann?"
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Leslie Knope,I wonder if I'll ever stop doing that.
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Ron Swanson,"I honestly don't care, but I'm just gonna say it."
Ron Swanson,I like Joe.
Ron Swanson,"He's a nice man who's good with kids, and he seems to be smart and patient."
Donna Meagle,I know.
Donna Meagle,That's why he's my Tammy.
Donna Meagle,I'm a social butterfly.
Donna Meagle,"When we're together, all we do is have sex, sit on the couch, eat homemade pasta,  have sex again."
Ron Swanson,Enough.
Donna Meagle,"He's constantly being respectful, wanting to spend time with me, trying to ""connect"" with me."
Donna Meagle,It's a nightmare.
Donna Meagle,I become boring.
Ron Swanson,"Live your life how you want, but don't confuse drama with happiness."
April Ludgate,"So I've been talking to Larry, and he's definitely not dying."
Andy Dwyer,"Technically, we're all dying, unless you choose the right grail."
Andy Dwyer,It's the dusty one.
April Ludgate,"Andy, I was nice to Larry."
April Ludgate,I scratched his back.
April Ludgate,I had a conversation with him.
April Ludgate,It was horrible.
April Ludgate,How can you do that to me?
Andy Dwyer,Fine.
Andy Dwyer,I'll tell you the secret.
Andy Dwyer,Ben's dog is dying.
April Ludgate,Lie.

April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Leslie is a spy.
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,Tom has something wrong with his butt.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,They need an encore.
Andy Dwyer,"Honey, they wantthe kids want an encore, I'm sorry."
Andy Dwyer,What song should we do?
Andy Dwyer,You wanna do Toots?
Joe,"I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you."
Joe,But you're still gonna want to go to a garage 'cause I don't…
Donna Meagle,I like to do things.
Joe,Excuse me.
Donna Meagle,"Museums, opera, nightclubs."
Donna Meagle,Sometimes I disappear for a day or two 'cause I'm flyfishing or I'm at a Seattle Sounders game.
Donna Meagle,I promise not to cheat on you if you promise not to try to pin me down too fast.
Joe,I have no problem with that.
Donna Meagle, You can take me to dinner Friday.
Joe," I have only one request-- that you wear that, uh, red thing."
Donna Meagle, I'll wear that red thing when you deserve to see me in that red thing.
Joe, Gotta go make some muffins.
Leslie Knope," Okay, there's still plenty of ways to raise money for the concert, right?"
Leslie Knope,Maybe we'll win the lottery.
Leslie Knope," I mean, hey, you're looking at a woman who just hit triple cherries in her uterus."
Ben Wyatt, We're screwed.
Leslie Knope," No, we're not, we have three weeks until the concert."
Leslie Knope,It'll be fine.
Ben Wyatt,"No, not the concert."
Ben Wyatt, The triple cherries.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, of course it's the most amazing and wonderful thing to ever happen, but, okay, I am an accountant, and I am looking a cold, hard facts."
Ben Wyatt, Raising three kids is going to cost 2 million dollars.
Leslie Knope," Babe, our kids will be geniuses."
Leslie Knope, They'll get scholarships.
Leslie Knope, Half of my tuition was paid for by the Indiana scholarship for pretty blondes who like to read.
Leslie Knope, It's now called the Virginia Woolf prize-- different time.
Ben Wyatt," Leslie, I have been trying so hard not to stress you out, but we just spent our entire savings account on a trip to Paris."
Ben Wyatt, What were we thinking?
Ben Wyatt,We spent too much money on macaroons.
Leslie Knope," Okay, honey--"
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, wait, what's the number for the Louvre? I mean, maybe I can get a refund."
Ben Wyatt, We barely looked at the Mona Lisa.
Leslie Knope," Honey, can you just breathe for a second?"
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, these numbers are going to determine everything for the rest of our lives!"
Leslie Knope,Breathe.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe we should move because we could make more money, or maybe we should stay here because it's cheaper to live here than in Chicago."
Ben Wyatt," Oh, my God! I'm shamwowing all of your stress, and there's no one here to wring me out."
Leslie Knope,Benjamin Wyatt
Ben Wyatt,I don't even know--
Leslie Knope,"The man of my dreams, the one that I love, shh."
Ben Wyatt," Leslie, we are in trouble here."
Ben Wyatt, We are in real trouble!
Leslie Knope,I'm so sorry.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Leslie Knope,"You just look so crazy right now, but cute."
Ben Wyatt, You're always stressed out.
Ben Wyatt, How are you calm right now?
Leslie Knope,Because I realized something.
Leslie Knope," Everything that we have been through-- the harvest festival, the election, the recall, the merger, Ann leaving, Larry changing his name for some stupid reason-- all of it has just been preparation for this."
Leslie Knope, I am immune to stress because I have you.
Leslie Knope, Come on.
Leslie Knope, I have an idea.
Ivy Lewis, Ron is King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest.
Ron Swanson, Much obliged.
Donna Meagle, So I'm going to dinner with Joe next week.
Ron Swanson, Glad to hear it.
Donna Meagle, It's always nice to see someone actually change for the better.
Ron Swanson," Yes, Joe seems like a good man, but at this point, I'm done talking about him."
Donna Meagle, I was talking about you.
Donna Meagle, Your family has made you a more patient and empathetic person.
Ron Swanson,You take that back.
Donna Meagle,"Come on, Swanson."
Donna Meagle, Did you think even two years ago you'd be playing matchmaker for me while wearing a glittery crown?
Donna Meagle,Now you're a dad.
Donna Meagle," You care a little, itty bit about your friends."
Donna Meagle, You're King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest.
Donna Meagle, It suits you.
April Ludgate," Andy, the camo is not working."
April Ludgate, I can see you.
Andy Dwyer,"Damn, really?"
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate," Babe, you don't have to hide from me."
April Ludgate," I don't care about the secret anymore, okay?"
April Ludgate,"I just thought, when we got married, we would share everything, but if you really can't tell me or whatever, it's fine."
April Ludgate, I trust you.
Andy Dwyer," It's just that it's a really big secret, and for once, I wanted to keep my word."
Andy Dwyer, But screw it.
Andy Dwyer, You're more important than anything.
Andy Dwyer, I'm gonna tell you 'cause it's super juicy-- you ready?
April Ludgate,Okay.
Leslie Knope," Everybody, if you could gather around…"
Andy Dwyer,They're here-- don't try to get it out of me anymore.
Leslie Knope, The reason I have been acting so weird is not because I've been waiting for the results of the soil samples to come back.
Jerry Gergich," Well, jeez, I've been up all night trying to make sure--"
Leslie Knope,"It doesn't matter, Larry."
Leslie Knope, It was a pointless ruse designed to waste time.
Leslie Knope, The truth is I'm pregnant.
Andy Dwyer," Yes, I did it! I kept a secret."
Ron Swanson, Congratulations.
Ron Swanson, I'm sure you will both raise a wonderful child with whom I will profoundly disagree on nearly everything.
Ben Wyatt," Well, actually, and this is crazy, but it's children, plural."
Leslie Knope,"We're having triplets, and…"
Jerry Gergich,Shut the--
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my God!"
Ben Wyatt,A little freaked out about it.
April Ludgate, That's amazing.
April Ludgate," Babe, I am so glad you didn't tell me."
Andy Dwyer, I know.
Andy Dwyer, I'm incredible.
Jerry Gergich," Okay, now listen to me, you two."
Jerry Gergich," Gayle and I have kept everything our girls ever used, so we have, like, millions of clothes and strollers and--  just don't buy a thing, okay?"
Ron Swanson,A triple crib-- sounds like an interesting woodworking challenge.
Ron Swanson," Would you like oak or pine? I'll make both, and you can choose."
Donna Meagle, My boyfriend-- my friend Joe has the hookup at all the good preschools.
April Ludgate," Andy and I can babysit anytime, except for on weekends and nights, but we're free anytime during work hours."
Jerry Gergich, This is gonna be the happiest time of your life!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, I sold everything on the auction list, no thanks to you people."
Craig Middlebrooks, What's so wonderful that you're all celebrating while I do all the hard work?
Leslie Knope,We're having triplets.
Craig Middlebrooks," Oh, great."
Craig Middlebrooks," First my cousin Winona gets into a car accident the night my one-man show opens, and now this?"
Craig Middlebrooks,Why are my accomplishments always overshadowed?
Craig Middlebrooks,"Congratulations, I suppose."
Leslie Knope, That's nice of him.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah, I'll take that."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.

Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, Alcatraz."
Andy Dwyer,Can't believe Michael Bay spent a billion dollars of his own money to build that for The Rock.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe you were able to recite that entire movie from memory on the plane ride.
Andy Dwyer,"You weren't trying to sleep, were you?"
Andy Dwyer,"I couldn't tell, 'cause you had that mask thing over your eyes."
Leslie Knope,This may be the craziest week of my entire life.
Leslie Knope,I am six days away from the start of the Unity concert.
Leslie Knope,I am pregnant with triplets.
Leslie Knope,"I am trying to decide if I should take a job that will move me away from Pawnee, and I am speaking at the National Parks conference in San Francisco."
Leslie Knope,It is gonna be so much fun.
Leslie Knope,"Michelle Obama is the keynote speaker, and you know what they say, ""What happens at a national parks conference... Is compiled and emailed to you in a PDF the following Monday."""
Andy Dwyer,We got to find a way to break in there.
Ben Wyatt,They give tours.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,That's exactly how they'll be expecting me to try to break in.
Tom Haverford,"My restaurant opens in six weeks, and I'm making sure I get every detail right."
Tom Haverford,This is the hardest I've worked on anything since... Wow.
Tom Haverford,I've never worked hard on anything.
Tom Haverford,What a cool life!
Mitch Savner,Looks like everything's on track for July.
Mitch Savner,It's just too bad we're not opening in time for this Unity concert.
Mitch Savner,The extra publicity would've given us a nice boost.
Tom Haverford,Why don't we?
Tom Haverford,We could do a soft opening tomorrow and be ready just in time for the concert crowd.
Mitch Savner,You really think you can pull that off?
Tom Haverford,"Well, nobody can predict the future except me."
Tom Haverford,"I guarantee it'll work and in six months, this place will be bigger than McDonald's."
Mitch Savner,"As always, I love your enthusiasm."
Mitch Savner,"See you tomorrow, partner."
Craig Middlebrooks,A soft opening tomorrow?
Craig Middlebrooks,"From now on, everyone call me Kristin, because I am wigging out right now!"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, we're not even close to being ready."
April Ludgate,They're not even done painting that sign.
April Ludgate,"It says, ""Tom's Bi."""
April Ludgate,"Actually, no, that's good."
April Ludgate,We're ready.
Tom Haverford,Mitch is right.
Tom Haverford,The amount of buzz we get from opening next weekend is too big to pass up.
Tom Haverford,We can do it.
Tom Haverford,"""This little Italian restaurant will put McDonald's out of business"" on three."
Tom Haverford,"One, two, three."
April Ludgate,Dark Lord rise--
Tom Haverford,This little Italian restaurant  will be bigger than McDonald's!

Leslie Knope,I I would…
Grant Larson,Liam Bonneville's gonna be there.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville-- the department of the interior's resident bad boy?

Ben Wyatt,"Andy and I are meeting with a tech company called ""Gryzzl."""
Ben Wyatt,"Now, they're giving away free wifi to a few cities across America, and we're going to pitch Pawnee to them."
Ben Wyatt,And what exactly does Gryzzl do?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, ""It's the cloud for your cloud."""
Ben Wyatt,No idea.
Ben Wyatt,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,"So Gryzzl's really taken off, huh?"

Ben Wyatt,"In fact, a lot of people go to the library just to order pizza online."
Mike Bean,"Right now we're kind of focused on, like, bigger cities, like Shreveport, Akron."
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
Ben Wyatt,"Obviously, we're no Akron."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we're more like Dayton."
Ben Wyatt,"But with your help, we can become Toledo."
Mike Bean,"Ben, we don't like to say the word ""no""…"
Mike Bean,At this company.
Mike Bean,"We feel it's counterproductive to our creative mission, so, instead, let me say ""Nah, bro."""
Ben Wyatt,How is that better?
Tom Haverford,"Dwayne ""the Rock"" Swanson."
Tom Haverford,Donna told me I'd find you up here.
Tom Haverford,What's all this?
Ron Swanson,"Over the last few months, I've remodeled the entire third floor wiring, heating and cooling, restored this red pine back to its original glory."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, wow."
Tom Haverford,The stripes are so wavy.
Tom Haverford,"It's really... all right, I can't keep this facade up any longer."
Tom Haverford,I need a favor.
Tom Haverford,You know those chairs you were making for my restaurant?
Tom Haverford,I need 'em now.
Ron Swanson,I was told I had until July.
Ron Swanson,My chairs take time.
Ron Swanson,"Who do you think I am, Thomas Hucker?"
Tom Haverford,"Please, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,I've never asked you for anything today.

Grant Larson,"Leslie, this is Rebecca---"
Leslie Knope,"Varuvian, yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,I know who you are.
Leslie Knope,I've read all of your papers and I had your poster on my wall when I was a kid.
Rebecca Varuvian,What poster?
Leslie Knope,I made a poster of you by blowing up your picture from the national parks newsletter.
Leslie Knope,I cut out your face and made it look like you were dunking over Charles Barkley.
Rebecca Varuvian,My God.
Liam Bonneville,"So you're the author of the famous river cleanup proposal, huh?"
Liam Bonneville,It wasn't bad.
Leslie Knope,Liam Bonneville read my proposal.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Rebecca Varuvian,"Liam's being withholding, as usual."
Rebecca Varuvian,That proposal was brilliantly written.
Leslie Knope,Rebecca Varuvian.
Rebecca Varuvian,Yes?
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,That was the best lunch I ever had.
Leslie Knope,I have to see the photos that you took.
Grant Larson,I didn't take any photos.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Grant, come on."
Grant Larson,"Leslie, you're treating those people like they're your heroes."

Grant Larson,"Look, I really hope you take the job, but we're at the end of the line here."
Grant Larson,I need a decision by tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that's fair."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I would be insane not to take the job, but I'm just having some trouble thinking about leaving Pawnee."
Grant Larson,"Hey, here's someone who may be able to convince you."
Grant Larson,"Hello, Mrs. Obama."
Michelle Obama,"Hey, Grant."
Michelle Obama,How you doing?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Grant Larson,Doing good.
Grant Larson,This is Leslie Knope.
Grant Larson,She's considering a job with us running the new Midwest Bureau in Chicago.
Michelle Obama,"Well, you know how I feel about Chicago."
Leslie Knope,"Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!"
Michelle Obama,"That's right, and we need passionate people like you on our national parks."
Michelle Obama,"You know, they get hundreds of millions of visitors each year."
Michelle Obama,Are you nodding because you agree with me?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I do agree with you."
Leslie Knope,"I agree with you on all things throughout history until the end of time, forever."
Leslie Knope,You and Grant work together?
Michelle Obama,"Yeah, we work together a lot."
Michelle Obama,"He's helped me integrate the ""Let's Move"" program into our national parks you know, getting kids outside, rock climbing, hiking."
Leslie Knope,Wow!
Leslie Knope,"That's really, really incredible!"
Leslie Knope,Great work!
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,"I'm getting louder now, and I can't stop!"
Leslie Knope,My apologies!
Leslie Knope,Just-- I don't know.
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!
Leslie Knope,Just can I high-five you?
Michelle Obama,Yeah.
Michelle Obama,Well I hope you take the job.
Michelle Obama,Change happens one person at a time.
Michelle Obama,Good to meet you.
Grant Larson,"Again, think it over."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, this is a bad idea."
Andy Dwyer,Just trust me.
Andy Dwyer,You got your camera ready?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, Andy, I'm very nervous about this."
Leslie Knope,You're gonna hurt yourself.
Andy Dwyer,And here we go.
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Andy Dwyer,Look at it go!
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I knew it'd go down, but not that fast!"
Andy Dwyer,Oh-ho!
Andy Dwyer,San Francisco's the best.
Leslie Knope,Huh.
Ben Wyatt,I thought he was gonna be on it.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Anyway I've decided.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna take the job.
Leslie Knope,"There's so much more in the world to see, and I feel like I can really make a difference."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and I met Michelle Obama."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,Why didn't you lead with that?
Leslie Knope,I don't know!
Leslie Knope,Liam Boneville has me in a tizzy.
Andy Dwyer,Guys!
Andy Dwyer,It's totally broken!
Tom Haverford,We have ten tables booked for the soft opening.
Tom Haverford,"It's all friends and family, so hopefully they'll go easy on us."
Tom Haverford,"How's it looking, Ron?"
Tom Haverford,Maybe speed it up a little?
Ron Swanson,This is not government work.
Ron Swanson,"As such, I treat it with care and attention."
Tom Haverford,"Okay, but also, go faster."
Tom Haverford,"I haven't had time to hire a staff yet, so, April, you'll handle service."
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,Can't I just stay in the back and spit in people's food like we planned?
Craig Middlebrooks,Ugh!
Craig Middlebrooks,The sawdust from Ron's chairs is everywhere!
Craig Middlebrooks,"My sinuses are on the Fritz, and smell is 90% of taste, maybe 95%!"
Tom Haverford,"Okay, Craig, Donna's gonna be your wine taster."
Tom Haverford,You guys will work as a team.
Donna Meagle,"Fine, but if he raises his voice once, once, I'm out."
Tom Haverford,Please don't stick to that policy.
Jerry Gergich,I got the menus.
Tom Haverford,Great.
Tom Haverford,"Larry, what the hell?"
Tom Haverford,What are these pictures?
Jerry Gergich,"Aw, jeez, I must have given the printer the wrong flash drive."
Tom Haverford,"What is this, a rotten grapefruit?"
Jerry Gergich,"No, it's my dog's rectum."
Jerry Gergich,"Lord Sheldon has a growth, so we're sending pictures over to the vet."
Jerry Gergich,"But I guess this isn't good for menus, is it?"
Tom Haverford,"Larry, Larry, Larry, listen to me."
Tom Haverford,This is the worst thing you've ever done.
Tom Haverford,I need you to take all of these dog butt pictures and burn them in the pizza oven.
Tom Haverford,"April, you list all the menu items from memory."
Tom Haverford,It'll be classier anyway.
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Tom Haverford,What was wrong with that one?
Ron Swanson,It was too perfect.
Ron Swanson,It looked machine made.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we have to convince 'em that Pawnee is a special city."
Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, we could tell 'em that there's buried treasure in Pawnee."
Andy Dwyer,"And then after they give us the free wifi, we tell 'em that the treasure was love all along."
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"I am not gonna take ""no"" for an answer."
Ben Wyatt,"If we're leaving Pawnee, I'm gonna give 'em a goingaway present free wifi for all."
Ben Wyatt,"Every time someone in Pawnee clicks through a slideshow of American music award red carpet side-boob fails, they'll say, ""Thank you, Ben Wyatt."""
Ben Wyatt,What the hell?
Ben Wyatt,They're playing Cones of Dunshire.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you invented that game."
Andy Dwyer,Are they playing any games I invented?
Andy Dwyer,Are they throwing dirt into a fan?
Andy Dwyer,"The key is, you have to throw the dirt  into the back of the fan."
Ben Wyatt,How the hell did they-- Excuse me.
Ben Wyatt,How did you guys get your hands on this game?
Extra,Someone sent it to us.
Extra,Have you played it?
Ben Wyatt,I invented Cones of Dunshire.
Extra,You're the architect.
Extra,"Yeah, right, and I'm the Alchemist of the Hinterlands."
Ben Wyatt,There can't be an Alchemist of the Hinterlands.
Ben Wyatt,The Hinterlands is a Shadow Kingdom that can only sustain a provost or a denier.
Mike Bean,He's right.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how about this?"
Ben Wyatt,Let's play.
Ben Wyatt,"If I win, you give me another shot at free wireless for Pawnee."
Mike Bean,Have a seat.
Mike Bean,You want to be corporal...  or warrior?
Ben Wyatt,Neither.
Ben Wyatt,I'm the Maverick.
Leslie Knope,By using the Leslie Knope seamless merger supersystem-- patent pending-- Pawnee and Eagleton and their parks departments will be fully integrated within the next 6 to 12 months.
Leslie Knope,"I know, I know."
Leslie Knope,I think it was a good presentation too.
Leslie Knope,Is that why you're laughing?
Extra,Your timeline is way off.
Extra,I was in charge of the Wesham/Southborough merger of 2004.
Extra,You know when it was completed?
Extra,Last month.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,How is that possible?
Extra,Merging governments requires constant hands-on management.
Extra,You're being very cavalier about the future of your town.
Leslie Knope,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"I've been accused of lot of things, but cavalier has never been one of them."
Leslie Knope,I have a super system.
Extra,"I had a system too, but the economy went South."
Extra,My hometown hit some hard times and was converted into unincorporated territory.
Leslie Knope,You lost your cityhood?
Extra,"If you want to see this through, you need eight to ten years minimum, unless you want to run the risk of Pawnee becoming --"
Leslie Knope,Don't say it.
Extra,Unincorporated territory.
Donna Meagle,"It's a bold flavor fruity, a little earthy."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, which is it fruity or earthy?"
Craig Middlebrooks,It can't be both.
Craig Middlebrooks,They're mutually exclusive!
Donna Meagle,"Oh, no!"
Donna Meagle,You do not come at me like that.
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm sorry.
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't know who I am anymore.
Craig Middlebrooks,A man without a palate isn't a man.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I love you, Donna."
Tom Haverford,What are you guys doing?
Tom Haverford,There's people waiting out there!
Craig Middlebrooks,"We're having a moment, you monster!"
Tom Haverford,Ugh!
Ron Swanson,Stop hassling me.
Tom Haverford,"Ron, you're amazing."
Tom Haverford,"You've always been like a grandpa to me, but can you please lower your standards a tiny bit so my customers have somewhere to sit?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,"I am so sorry, Tom."
Tom Haverford,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but don't worry about it."
Tom Haverford,Restaurant superstition-- breaking a glass on the first night is good luck.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank God."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, jeez."
Ben Wyatt,"Play an action card, build a bell tower inside your citadel."
Mike Bean,My shaman casts a toyber spell on your prosperity tile.
Mike Bean,Looks like someone's out of resource gems.
Mike Bean,Uh-oh.
Mike Bean,What's so funny?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no, no, you're a smart guy, clearly picked up some flashy tricks, but you made one crucial mistake."
Ben Wyatt,You forgot about the essence of the game.
Ben Wyatt,It's about the Cones.
Ben Wyatt,"Move my abbot to the ocean hex, which moves my Brinksman to the Devil's Lair, and pushes my farmer-- yes, my humble farmer-- directly into the central cone."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, man, we did it."
Andy Dwyer,This whole company is ours.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, it's not."
Andy Dwyer,"That's mine, it's all mine."
Ben Wyatt,"Andy... for the record, I did invent this game."
Ben Wyatt,"But it doesn't even matter, because I won and I get another chance to prove that there's something truly special about Pawnee."
Mike Bean,"Yes, there is."
Mike Bean,It's the home of the architect.
Mike Bean,Let's talk.
Andy Dwyer,I'm on top of the world.
Ben Wyatt,"Andy, what are you doing?"
Mitch Savner,Seems like things are a little chaotic.
Tom Haverford,"No, no, everything is perfect."
Tom Haverford,This is April.
Tom Haverford,She's gonna be taking care of you tonight.
April Ludgate,"Hello, welcome to Tommy's Bistro."
April Ludgate,"Today we have spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, ravioli, rigatoni, bucatini, lasagna."
Mitch Savner,Could you repeat that?
April Ludgate,"Spaghetti, linguini, fettuccini, ravioli, Ferrari, Lamborghini, bucatini, lasagna."
Mitch Savner,Can I see a menu?
April Ludgate,We had to throw our menus away because they are covered with pictures of Larry's dog rectum.
Jerry Gergich,Great news.
Jerry Gergich,Lord Sheldon's gonna make it.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, just have to apply a salve to his anus every hour for the rest of his life, but…"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, enjoy your meal."
Mitch Savner,For crying out loud!
Tom Haverford,"No, Mitch, don't leave."
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Mitch Savner,You have no idea how to run a restaurant.
Mitch Savner,I've been in this game before and I can see the cracks starting to form.
Mitch Savner,"Sorry, kid, consider my investment terminated."
Mitch Savner,"D, let's go."
Ron Swanson,"Sir, were you sitting in that chair?"
Mitch Savner,"Yes, yes I was."
Mitch Savner,Why?
Ron Swanson,No reason.
Mitch Savner,Let's go!
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, it's all over the Internet-- Austin, Charlotte, San Diego."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe."
Leslie Knope,That's great.
Ben Wyatt,I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'll look into that, but at least because of it, Pawnee will get free wireless, and we can both move away with a clear conscience."
Ben Wyatt,Uh-oh.
Ben Wyatt,What's wrong?
Leslie Knope,I can't leave Pawnee during a difficult merger that I'm responsible for.
Leslie Knope,I have to turn down the job.
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, no."
Ben Wyatt,You made up your mind yesterday.
Ben Wyatt,You-- Michelle Obama.
Leslie Knope,"I know, but I've been doing this for months."
Leslie Knope,The only thing that I am 100% positive on is that I want to stay and go.
Leslie Knope,I'm never gonna be able to decide.
Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals until I die here, in this minivan at the San Francisco airport."
Ben Wyatt,Wait a second.
Ben Wyatt,I have an idea.
Ben Wyatt,Drive here.
Ron Swanson,So you screwed up a little.
Ron Swanson,"You tried to shoot the moon, and you came up short."
Ron Swanson,That doesn't mean it's over.
Tom Haverford,My main investor pulled out.
Tom Haverford,Any dollar I spend from now on is my own.
Tom Haverford,"And despite what my pocket square says, I'm not a billionaire."
Tom Haverford,So I quit.
Tom Haverford,"Just go home, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I'm not done with the chairs yet.
Ron Swanson,It is my belief that you never start a job you don't intend to finish.
Tom Haverford,Really?
Tom Haverford,I love quitting.
Tom Haverford,"When I was a kid and things didn't go my way, I would just take my ball and go home."
Tom Haverford,"That's better than winning, 'cause then your friends can't play anymore."
April Ludgate,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"No, my stemware!"
April Ludgate,You are not quitting.
April Ludgate,"I just called a bunch of reviewers, and I told them that the soft opening went great, and I invited them to come here on Friday."
Tom Haverford,Why would you do this to me?
April Ludgate,You worked really hard.
April Ludgate,"You owe it to yourself to give it a real shot, because you are smart and talented."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I hate doing work, but I love being flattered, so maybe I'll give it another try."
April Ludgate,Good.
Ron Swanson,"It's a smart move, son."
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Ron."
Ron Swanson,"Because you currently owe me $16,000 for the wood."
Tom Haverford,What?
Leslie Knope,Where are we going?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's right up here."
Ben Wyatt,Just trust me.
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,I'm on Endor.
Ben Wyatt,These are the redwoods George Lucas used to create the forest moon of Endor.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry.
Ben Wyatt,That's not why we're here.
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a gorgeous view."
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, it is."
Ben Wyatt,But don't look at that.
Ben Wyatt,Look at this.
Ben Wyatt,You've been thinking about this job in the abstract.
Ben Wyatt,Focus on what it actually means.
Ben Wyatt,We're standing in a national park that stretches 50 miles.
Ben Wyatt,That's the Presidio over there.
Ben Wyatt,It's a national park.
Ben Wyatt,"So is Alcatraz, and so are the redwoods we just walked through, by the way."
Ben Wyatt,"You take this job, places like this will be your office."
Leslie Knope,"Well, that is a compelling point."
Ben Wyatt,"When we got back from London, you said that it's a very big world and you've seen very little of it."
Ben Wyatt,"This is your chance, honey."
Ben Wyatt,"This whole region-- Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, the Ozarks, Abe Lincoln's childhood home you would be in charge of all of it."
Ben Wyatt,Your job would be to preserve the most beautiful places on earth so millions of people could enjoy them.
Ben Wyatt,"And those places, the greatest treasures America has to offer, will all have signs with your name right there."
Leslie Knope,"Hi, Grant."
Leslie Knope,I want the job.
Leslie Knope,"I have a lot of questions, but I'm a little amped up right now, so I'll probably just hang up."
Leslie Knope,It might be for the best.
Leslie Knope,"But, anyway, I love you."
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,That was weird.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, this is Lester Kanopf."
Leslie Knope,"No, you know who it--"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, bye."
Ben Wyatt,"Smoothly handled, Lester."
Leslie Knope,I panicked.
Leslie Knope,We should go.
Leslie Knope,"We have a lot of stuff to do and the meter's still running on that cab, so chop chop."
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Tom Haverford,The opening of Tom's Bistro was a disaster.
Tom Haverford,So what?
Tom Haverford,This is America.
Tom Haverford,"And America's the land of second chances, and now we have one night, one afterparty to make the world realize that Tom's Bistro is where miracles can happen!"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Thomas, I have to work all day at the Unity concert."
Craig Middlebrooks,"If you're gonna pull this off, we need more people."
Tom Haverford,"I know, and I didn't want to do this, but I called in some reinforcements."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Did someone call for a party zoo?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Yum, yum, yum, yum."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"All right, so we got a fourway going with my ex, my brother, and this rando?"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Okay, if that's where the night is going…"
Tom Haverford,It's 9:00 in the morning…
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Wha--
Tom Haverford, It's not a fourway.
Tom Haverford,And I need your help.
Tom Haverford,Take these V.I.P. invitations.
Tom Haverford,"Find all the ""A"" list peeps at the concert and get 'em to the restaurant tonight."
Tom Haverford,I got to stop by the Parks office.
Tom Haverford,I'll meet you later.
Tom Haverford,Godspeed.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I like your energy, hombre."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What do you say you and I ride gokarts later?
Craig Middlebrooks,I want to go horseback riding!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Deal.
Andy Dwyer,"Last chance, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister Duke Silver wanted to come out."
Andy Dwyer,"Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting."
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you are in charge."
Leslie Knope,This is your show.
Leslie Knope,Take it away.
Andy Dwyer,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept the following missions."
Andy Dwyer,Madison.
Madison,Manning that art tents.
Andy Dwyer,Donna.
Donna Meagle,Scheduling and security liaison.
Andy Dwyer,Larry.
Jerry Gergich,Staying out of the way.
Andy Dwyer,And all of the rest of the volunteer work assignments are up on this board.
April Ludgate,"Your main goal today is to get 2,000 people to sign up for the Pawnee Eagleton merger preservation volunteer action squad."
April Ludgate,Their first project will be to come up with a shorter name for the group.
Leslie Knope,You're right.
Leslie Knope,The name is too long.
Leslie Knope,I was picturing bigger hats.
Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go."
Andy Dwyer,"Everybody, let's get to work."
Leslie Knope,Can the Parks and Rec people hang back for a second?
Leslie Knope,"Um The reason I wanted you guys to stick around is, I wanted to tell you…"
Leslie Knope,That I love and admire you.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, thank you."
April Ludgate,You say that every morning.
Leslie Knope,"A while ago, I was offered a job at the national parks service, and it's a great opportunity, but it means that I'll have to move to Illinois."
Leslie Knope,And I took the job.
Andy Dwyer,Good for you!
Jerry Gergich,Wow!
Andy Dwyer,That's great!
Ron Swanson,"Congratulations, Knope."
Ron Swanson,The sentimental people in this office will probably miss you.
Donna Meagle,When do you leave?
Ben Wyatt,"Soon, maybe a month."
Tom Haverford,Oh.
Tom Haverford,That makes what we're about to show you a little bit awkward.
Tom Haverford,We had a new founders day statue commissioned and added your name to the list of founders of Pawnee.
April Ludgate,Because you basically founded this new town.
Leslie Knope,"Leslie Knope, champion of the Pawnee Eagleton merger, ""our most faithful citizen."""
Leslie Knope,"""She never abandoned us."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Jerry Gergich,There's a quote too.
Leslie Knope,"""'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.' Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."""
Ron Swanson,I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.
Leslie Knope,"This is so touching, you guys."
Leslie Knope,I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, don't cry."
Andy Dwyer,It's not that great.
Andy Dwyer,It doesn't even look like you.
Andy Dwyer,"Or, actually, you know what?"
Andy Dwyer,It kind of does.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, it's about that time."
Andy Dwyer,Unity concert!
The Decembrists,"Hello, Pawnee."
The Decembrists,We're The Decembrists.
The Decembrists,It's great to be here in support of this event.
The Decembrists,This is truly an amazing town.
The Decembrists,"I ordered a small cheeseburger, and both the buns were pizzas."
Tom Haverford,"Joanie baby, I'm throwing a huge party tonight at Tom's Bistro."
Tom Haverford,You gots to stop by.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You gots to stop by.
Joan Callamezzo,Will this medium drink of water be there?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,The only reason I wouldn't be there is if I got pulled over...  For violating my house arrest.  Ahboosh!
Joan Callamezzo,What?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Judge gave me two ankle bracelets, said it was the first time he ever had to do that."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uh, jah boy's a question on the bar exam."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yah-hey!
Tom Haverford,"Anyway, Tom's Bistro, tonight, be there."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Uhoh.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Okay.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Don't just let me talk--
Ben Wyatt,"Well, the relocation package seems fair, but the dental plan is more than fair."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, three annual cleanings for the spouse?"
Ben Wyatt,Kaching.
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, did someone say ""dental plan""?"
Jeremy Jamm,How's it going?
Jeremy Jamm,"Councilman Jeremy Jamm, Jamm orthodontics."
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, uh, I think we can all agree this concert blows, right?"
Jeremy Jamm,"You guys really want to see a crowd, you might want to stop by my secession rally later tonight."
Jeremy Jamm,That is gonna be off the hook!
Jeremy Jamm,You ever heard of warrant?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,"There's a cover band around here they call themselves ""Cherry Pie."""
Jeremy Jamm,Pretty sure we got their bass player.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Jeremy Jamm,Gonna be pretty good.
Jeremy Jamm,"Dahnahnah, rock and roll, yeah, poison"
Leslie Knope,What is that?
Jeremy Jamm,"Just general rock, man."
Jeremy Jamm,It's gonna be fun.
Jeremy Jamm,"She's my cherry pie, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Grant Larson,that guy was a councilman?
Leslie Knope,"Crazy, right?"
Grant Larson,"Okay, uh, let's talk staff."
Grant Larson,"For the first few months, you're only gonna have six staffers."
Grant Larson,Four of them will be coming up from Omaha.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so does that mean that there's two openings left?"
Grant Larson,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,Because I happen to know some of the most dedicated civil servants and greatest people to ever walk the planet earth.
Grant Larson,You can hire whoever you like.
The Decembrists,"I will hang my head   hang my head low, low, low"
Tom Haverford,"Ginuwine, it is an honor to be breathing the same air as you."
Tom Haverford,No joke.
Tom Haverford,But real talk we're both men about town being constantly bombarded with party invitations.
Ginuwine,Who is this guy?
Tom Haverford,"My friend who's opening a restaurant tonight, and you're going to be there, cousin, unless you want me to get onstage and talk about how we used to take baths together, how you cried whenever I took away your rubber duckies."
Ginuwine,"Damn, Donna."
Ginuwine,Why you got to bring the Quackson 5 into this?
Ginuwine,How y'all doing?
Ginuwine,"Li'l Sebastian, this one is for you, because you're my pony."
Ginuwine,I'm just a bachelor I'm looking for a partner someone who knows how to ride
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I have to ask you something, and I want you to consider it, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Really consider it.
Leslie Knope,How would you feel about leaving Pawnee and moving to Chicago?
Leslie Knope,"Hold on, come on, I'm not done."
Leslie Knope,You'd be working for the federal government.
Leslie Knope,"You know what, excuse me for wanting my dear friend and ethical mentor to accompany me on the adventure of a lifetime."
Ron Swanson,"It's very sweet, Leslie, and the national parks service is probably the only branch of government worth a damn, but Diane and I are quite happy raising our family here."
Ron Swanson,"Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a booth over there serving something called, ""fried sausage quilts,"" so I'm going to buy the booth."
Ginuwine,Just once if I had the chance
Andy Dwyer,Hello.
Andy Dwyer,I'm Johnny Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Imaginary friends are cool   imaginary friends take the fall for you 
Zoe Lewis,"Daddy, you should play music."
Diane Lewis,"Yeah, Ron."
Diane Lewis,Go on.
Diane Lewis,Get up there.
Diane Lewis,Have some fun.
Ron Swanson,I recalibrated the sights on all the rifles in the shooting gallery.
Ron Swanson,I've had enough fun for one day.
Diane Lewis,"Oh, I know that look."
Diane Lewis,Where is she?
Ron Swanson,She's near.
Ron Swanson,Hide the children.
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron."
Tammy 2,"Hello, Ron's friend."
Ron Swanson,"Tammy, what could possibly bring you to a children's performance-- preparing a ritual sacrifice of a newborn?"
Tammy 2,"No, just trolling for some daddy."
Tammy 2,"Oh, sorry."
Tammy 2,I pronounced that wrong.
Tammy 2,"Trolling for some dad ""D."""
Ron Swanson,"Diane, why don't you take the girls for some ice cream while I dispose of this sewer dwelling gutter witch?"
Diane Lewis,"Bye, Tammy."
Diane Lewis,Always a pleasure.
Tammy 2,"You're not fooling me, Ron."
Tammy 2,This little domestic charade of yours hasn't changed you one bit.
Tammy 2,"You're still the same old Ron Swanson, and I will defeat you."
Tammy 2,I will defeat you right into my pants.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you!
Andy Dwyer,Everybody go crazy!
Andy Dwyer,"All right, thanks, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Remember karate on bad guys only.
Burly,"Hey, man, you were really great out there."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hey, burly."
Andy Dwyer,"How you doing, man?"
Burly,"Pretty good, man."
Burly,"Remember my nephew, Jack?"
Burly,He's a really big fan.
Andy Dwyer,"Whoa, hey, Jack."
Andy Dwyer,"Good to see you, bud."
Burly,"Hey, listen, man, I'm really sorry things ended so weird with mouse rat."
Burly,"You know, that's not really how I pictured us  breaking up, you know."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I do know."
Andy Dwyer,"I always figured we'd you know, whatever break up 'cause I got drafted by the Colts."
Andy Dwyer,"And then in the first game, of course, I'd break my leg."
Andy Dwyer,"Crowd starts chanting my name, and I give 'em the thumbsup."
Andy Dwyer,And then I'd go to the hospital.
Andy Dwyer,I'd get really good at chess.
Andy Dwyer,"I end up beating the computer finally, and then the band just sort of drifts apart."
Andy Dwyer,"That was how I saw it, but--"
Burly,Yeah.
Burly,Take it easy.
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, see you."
April Ludgate,"Babe, that was so awesome."
April Ludgate,That was the best performance ever.
April Ludgate,One kid peed his pants because he didn't want to miss anything.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,I gave a kid pee pants?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, that's why I do what I do."
April Ludgate,What's wrong?
Andy Dwyer,I guess I just kind of miss having people up onstage with me.
Andy Dwyer,They never tell you when you go solo that it's just gonna be you up there.
Andy Dwyer,"Anyways, what do you say I take you over to the ball pit, and we find your cell phone I lost?"
April Ludgate,You what?
Kay Hanley,"Just living on a Sunday morning   got my toast and tea, and I'm warm and   I just thought I'd think about   and it might be   the comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky   could never parallel the challenge of an acqusition in the here and now, here and now"
Ben Wyatt,"I love you, Kay Hanley!"
Leslie Knope,"I hope you like deep dish pizza, because there's gonna be a lot more of it in Chicago, where we're all gonna be moving."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,"We are not moving to Chicago for, like, a billion reasons."
Andy Dwyer,"But, babe, pizza."
April Ludgate,There's pizza in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Andy Dwyer,"Thanks, babe."
Andy Dwyer,You're so good at reminding me where pizza is.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, take a risk."
Leslie Knope,Live on the edge.
Leslie Knope,Life is an adventure.
Andy Dwyer,It is!
Andy Dwyer,Let's do it!
April Ludgate,No.
Andy Dwyer,No.
April Ludgate,"Pawnee is cheap, and we like it here, and Chicago seems like there's a lot of stuff to do and people, but I like to do nothing with no one."
April Ludgate,"So thank you, and I love you, but, no, thank you, and I hate you."
April Ludgate,I love you.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, you owe me for that pizza."
Bobby Knight Ranger,But you're motoring  Yeah motoring  Sister Christian.
Bobby Knight Ranger,"Thank you, Pawnee!"
Bobby Knight Ranger,We have been Bobby Knight Ranger!
Andy Dwyer,Super cool to hear Sister Christian that many times in a row.
Andy Dwyer,Now is the moment we've all been waiting for.
Andy Dwyer,"This next band agreed to reunite for one night only, and it's gonna be great."
Andy Dwyer,I personally hope that they play Summer Sun.
Andy Dwyer,"We all know how it goes, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Summer sun summer sun
Scott Tanner,"Hey, Andy."
Scott Tanner,"Why don't you let us play those, bud?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, yeah, good point."
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Without any further ado, land ho!"
Scott Tanner,"What up, Pawnee?"
Scott Tanner,"alone and zoned and sad no one gives a zig or zag I should have let you ride I should have let you go Thank you, Pawnee!"
April Ludgate,You miss the band?
Andy Dwyer,"No, I mean, I love that I'm Johnny Karate now, but being part of a band, that's just-- that's rock and roll, man."
Scott Tanner,"Joining us now for our finale, legendary local band, please welcome Mouse Rat!"
April Ludgate,You guys are closing this sucker down!
Andy Dwyer,"Well, how about this Unity concert, huh, Pawnee?"
Andy Dwyer,"I love this town so much, and I'm just so proud to live here."
Andy Dwyer,And we're gonna close tonight out with a tribute to Pawnee's greatest treasure.
Andy Dwyer,"Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing   You trade your legs for angel's wings   and once we've all said goodbye you take a running leap, and you learn to fly bye bye, Li'l Sebastian I miss you in the saddest fashion Whoo!"
All,"byebye, Li'l Sebastian you're 5,000 candles in the wind"
Andy Dwyer,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Duke Silver!"
All,"byebye, Li'l Sebastian   I miss you in the saddest fashion   byebye, Li'l Sebastian   you're 5,000 candles in the wind"
Tom Haverford,"Guys, this is the most important night of my life, which means it's the most important night of your lives too."
Craig Middlebrooks,Speak for yourself.
Craig Middlebrooks,I once got into a cab that Kyra Sedgwick was getting out of.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No way, The Closer?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Oof!
Tom Haverford, It's opening night.
Tom Haverford, Let's do this!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Hey, butt wieners!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Look who I found 
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Daddy!
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford, Your father ruined my last business.
Tom Haverford, Why would you bring him here?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Because you told me to look for V.I.P.s, and my daddy is the V.I.-est ""P"" I know."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I love you, daddy."
Dr. Saperstein,"I love you too, angel."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein," Money, please."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Mm! Money! Money! Money! Money, please!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Craig, we're gonna drink."
Tom Haverford," Why would you come here, Saperstein?"
Dr. Saperstein,"I came here to see your flourishing business, to see how well you're doing."
Dr. Saperstein, Wow! You're packed.
Dr. Saperstein," Can you squeeze me in, or do I need a reservation? 'Cause there's nobody here."
Tom Haverford, Maybe this restaurant won't be a huge success.
Tom Haverford, Maybe it won't be packed with celebrities.
Joan Callamezzo,Tommy!
Tom Haverford,Or maybe it will.
Tom Haverford,"Hello, Joan."
Tom Haverford," Hello, Perd."
Joan Callamezzo,Hi.
Tom Haverford, Thanks for coming by.
Tom Haverford,Can I get you a drink?
Joan Callamezzo,I'll have the Joan.
Joan Callamezzo," It's a tumbler of gin, and it's got crushed aspirin around the rim."
Perd Hapley, And I would just like an empty glass.
Tom Haverford," Steve, can we get these cocktails going for Joan and Perd? Oh, look, Kay Hanley, rock star, thanks for coming by."
Kay Hanley, Thanks for having me.
Tom Haverford," Come on in, guys."
Tom Haverford," You might want to grab a seat, Dr. Saperstein."
Tom Haverford, Looks like it's getting a little crowded.
Tom Haverford," And I said, ""you don't need a towel."""
Tom Haverford," ""You need a washcloth."""
Diane Lewis,"You know, I don't think that the girls have ever been happier or more surprised than when you got up on that stage."
Ron Swanson," Well, having you and the kids in my life has made me a different person."
Ron Swanson, And I like it.
Ron Swanson, There's more room in my life for fun.
Barney," Hi, Ben."
Barney," It's me, Barney, from the accounting firm."
Ben Wyatt, Yes.
Ben Wyatt," Hi, Barney."
Ben Wyatt, You don't have to introduce yourself every time.
Barney," I was gonna wait until your birthday to give this to you, but I'm just too excited."
Ben Wyatt, This is the copyright to Cones of Dunshire.
Barney," After you gave it to us as a gift, we saw its potential, so we formed a ""C"" corp and registered it in your name."
Ben Wyatt, This is amazing.
Ben Wyatt, How can I ever repay you?
Barney,Come work for us at the accounting firm.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Barney, Oh!  Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"No, sorry."
Ben Wyatt, I can't.
Barney, Wow.
Barney, Shortest one yet.
Ben Wyatt, Thank you.
Andy Dwyer," Babe, thank you so much for organizing the mouse rat reunion."
April Ludgate, It was actually Ginuwine who arranged everything.
April Ludgate, He really cares about you.
Andy Dwyer, You're the greatest wife ever.
Andy Dwyer, I wish I could marry you all over again.
Andy Dwyer, Let's get divorced.
Andy Dwyer," That way, we can get married again."
April Ludgate," Yes, let's do it."
Andy Dwyer,You want to?
April Ludgate,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"We should do that, right?"
April Ludgate,"Yeah, totally."
Andy Dwyer,We're getting divorced!
April Ludgate,Yes.
Tom Haverford, This is amazing.
Tom Haverford," Practically everyone we invited came, except for Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus."
Tom Haverford, I was hoping tonight would be magical enough to get 'em back together.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Let it go, friend."
Craig Middlebrooks," He's not good enough for her, and vice versa!"
Dr. Saperstein,Thomas.
Dr. Saperstein," Yes, we don't get along, but I look at you I see driven, I see smart, and I just had the best Italian meal I've ever had in my life, and I've been to Dallas."
Dr. Saperstein,I'm in.
Tom Haverford,No way.
Tom Haverford, I'm not gonna let you take another one of my businesses.
Dr. Saperstein," No, no, I'm in as a partner."
Dr. Saperstein, I'm always looking for new investments.
Dr. Saperstein, I've got an auto dealership.
Dr. Saperstein," I've got a massage parlor, a dry-cleaning transactional holding company that is doing unbelievably well, I might add."
Dr. Saperstein, What do you say?
Tom Haverford,"You know what? I'm not really looking for investors, given the almost embarrassing level of success I've attained, but I'll consider it."
Tom Haverford," Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get some pictures for my wall of fame."
Tom Haverford," Uh, excuse me, miss Hanley? Do you mind if I snap a you-ie? It's what I call selfies of other people."
Kay Hanley, Sure.
Ben Wyatt," Can I get everyone's attention, please? Our goal was to get 2,000 signatures in support of the merger."
Ben Wyatt," We got almost 4,000 on the first night."
Tom Haverford," Hey, everybody, let's keep this party going."
Tom Haverford, The next round of gnocchi is on the house.
Ron Swanson," You look sad, Knope."
Ron Swanson, Couldn't find any takers for Chicago?
Leslie Knope,Everybody turned me down but Larry.
Ron Swanson,Ouch.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ron Swanson," Well, cheer up."
Ron Swanson," You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like."
Leslie Knope," Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee."
Leslie Knope," I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here."
Leslie Knope," And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?"
Ron Swanson,"You will not, no."
Ron Swanson," I know it's not easy to leave, but this job does seem perfect."
Ron Swanson," Of course, I'd prefer you use your talents elsewhere."
Ron Swanson," You know, with your courage and small frame, you'd make an excellent coal miner."
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope, That's very sweet.
Ron Swanson, It's time for you to move up in the world.
Ron Swanson," Your ambition was bound to take you away from the town you love sooner or later, and you can't have everything you want."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, I can have everything I want!
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Ron Swanson,I feel like you're not listening to me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, and by the way, don't think that we are not discussing Duke silver."
Leslie Knope, When were you going to tell me about that? Unbelievable!
Leslie Knope,"I am so furious at you, but I've already forgiven you, and you need to teach me how to play the saxophone."
Leslie Knope," Okay, bye."
Grant Larson," Hi, Leslie and everyone."
Grant Larson,I'm Grant
Leslie Knope,No time for small talk.
Leslie Knope, I think the best version of me working as Midwest regional director is not in Chicago.
Leslie Knope, It's right here in Pawnee.
Grant Larson,How so?
Ben Wyatt,The financial savings here are enormous.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, the cost of living is way lower here, and renting the entire third floor of this building would be way cheaper than a much smaller space in Chicago."
Tom Haverford," Pawnee is actually closer to most of the parks in the Midwest region, and it's got Tom's Bistro an exciting new-wave Italian eatery that's equal parts Dean Martin and Bruno Mars."
Tom Haverford, But that's just what The Indianapolis Star is saying.
Tom Haverford, Let's see what everyone else has to say.
Donna Meagle," No, no, this is not what we're doing right now."
Donna Meagle,But congrats.
April Ludgate,Leslie should stay here.
April Ludgate," And if you don't agree with us, it's nine against one, and we can make you disappear forever."
Grant Larson,What?
April Ludgate,"I said, ""We have free wi-fi."""
Leslie Knope,"Look, Pawnee is a town on the rise, and national parks could get in on the ground floor."
Leslie Knope," It's the best option, hands down."
Grant Larson," Well, I'll run this up the flagpole."
Andy Dwyer," Also, can you bring back Power Rangers?"
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what it is you do, but you seem important enough to get that done."
Leslie Knope, Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise.
Leslie Knope, I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow.
Leslie Knope, But it is really how I feel today.
Leslie Knope," I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving, but the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility."
Leslie Knope, So I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.
Leslie Knope," Call Ken and Rebecca, and no statements to the press unless I personally release them."
Leslie Knope, We are on a media lockdown.
Leslie Knope, Where is Ed with the file? Ed!
Ed,"I'm sorry, Miss Knope, I lost the file."
Ed,It's gone.
Leslie Knope,"Ed, you're a nice guy, but you're the most incompetent person I've ever word with, and that includes Terry."
Jerry Gergich," Jeez! Get it together, Terry."
Leslie Knope, Clean out your desk.
Leslie Knope, You're fired.
Ed, I understand.
Ed, Thank you for the literally hundreds of opportunities you've given me.
Ed," Good-bye, everyone."
Ed, It's been a great three years.
Leslie Knope, Cancel my flight to South Dakota.
Leslie Knope, We'll do it next month.
Leslie Knope,"Babe, what's our play here?"
Ben Wyatt,Everyone's waiting downstairs in my office.
Ben Wyatt, Let's just go hear what they have to say.
Leslie Knope," But honey, tonight's your big night."
Ben Wyatt," No, this is more important."
Ben Wyatt, Where are the kids?
April Ludgate,Right here.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, guys! Mommy and daddy had to do a little work, and you're gonna have a fun play date with Uncle Andy and Aunty April, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,"Let's go, munchkins."
Andy Dwyer," I forgot, Ben how many bags of marshmallows do I give them?"
Ben Wyatt,None! Just let April do everything.
Leslie Knope," One day, in the distant future, things will be calm and normal, right?"
Ben Wyatt,Probably not.
Ben Wyatt, But that's okay.
Ben Wyatt,You ready?
Leslie Knope,Not at all.
Leslie Knope, But that's never stopped us before.

Leslie Knope,"I mean, there were rumors that they were gonna announce it next month."
Leslie Knope,But they must've gotten impatient.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Whatever they say, we need to come up with 10,000 possible responses to 10,000 possible scenarios."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Just to remind you, I don't work for the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah."
Leslie Knope,How are those scenarios coming?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, look, before we go in there, you need to know something."
Ben Wyatt,He's here.
Leslie Knope,Who's here?
Ben Wyatt,The guy whose name you forbid me from saying out loud because it fills you with rage.
Ben Wyatt,"Look, I don't know who he's working for, but I guess he's part of one of the bidding groups."
Ben Wyatt,Are you gonna be able to be civil in there?
Leslie Knope,I'm perfectly civil.
Leslie Knope,He's the stupid garbage head doodoo face.
Ben Wyatt,Perfect.
Trevor Nelson,Thank you all for coming.
Trevor Nelson,"I'm Trevor Nelson, legal counsel to the Newport family."
Trevor Nelson,"The Newport Family Trust intends to sell a 25 square mile parcel of pristine, undeveloped land containing Lake Eagleton and the Southern Indiana Foothills."
Ben Wyatt,Why now?
Ben Wyatt,The Newports have owned this land for 100 years.
Trevor Nelson,"Thanks to the recent economic boom in Pawnee, real estate prices are at an all time high."
Trevor Nelson,"And in the words of Jessica Wicks Newport, heir to the entire Newport fortune, quote, ""It's time to trade those dumb old trees for a buttload of cash."""
Jessica Wicks,It is.
Jessica Wicks,It truly is.
Leslie Knope,"This land is begging to be a new national park, and it's in my own backyard!"
Leslie Knope,This could be my crowning achievement.
Leslie Knope,I could retire.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I wouldn't."
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna work until I'm 100 and then cut back to four days a week.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,I'm already so bored thinking about that one day off.
Leslie Knope,Maybe I'll go to law school or something.
Trevor Nelson,"We will select the finalists from a set of initial, sealed bids due at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow."
Trevor Nelson,Good luck.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,There he is.
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,He's here?
Ben Wyatt,He is coming over.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to talk to him.
Leslie Knope,I should hide.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,He should hide.
Leslie Knope,He should run.
Leslie Knope,He should run away.
Leslie Knope,He should hide his stupid face.
Leslie Knope,He shouldn't be--
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Miss Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, former strange person I used to friend."
Leslie Knope,You're looking very Ron like.
Ron Swanson,You have your same hair.
Leslie Knope,"No, I don't!"
Leslie Knope,I have bangs now!
Ron Swanson,"I've never known what bangs are, and I don't intend to learn!"
Leslie Knope,"Well, maybe you should!"
Ron Swanson,I left the Parks Department two years ago.
Ron Swanson,"Now I work in the private sector, running my own building and development company."
Ron Swanson,It's called Very Good Building and Development Company.
Ron Swanson,I wanted to convey the quality of our work without seeming flashy.
Ben Wyatt,So your company is involved with one of the bidders?
Mike Bean,"Hell yeah, pimp!"
Mike Bean,He's on Team Gryzzl now.
Mike Bean,We hired his company to help plan and build our new Gryzzl campus.
Mike Bean,Right here in town on that land.
Mike Bean,"Oh, my gosh."
Mike Bean,It's perfect.
Mike Bean,The trees and rocks and the sky.
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,The land has good sky.
Mike Bean,"This guy, he's so far out."
Mike Bean,So normcore.
Leslie Knope,You know that the National Park System deserves this land.
Leslie Knope,Why are you trying to screw me?
Leslie Knope,This is like Morningstar all over again!
Ron Swanson,This is nothing like Morningstar.
Ron Swanson,And that was two years ago.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you don't know who you're dealing with."
Leslie Knope,"I directly oversee 1,200 people."
Leslie Knope,I have a staff of creative geniuses that will not stop working until we win this bid!
Ed,Leslie!
Ed,"I couldn't find that file you wanted, but I did find a file called Bird Census 1980."
Ed,And it's empty.
Leslie Knope,"Get out of here, Ed!"
Leslie Knope,I fired you.
Ed,Right.
Ed,"If anybody wants to hang, I will be at Subway."
Leslie Knope,He's very stupid.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I just dropped off Leslie's triplets with her mom."
Andy Dwyer,All three of 'em.
Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.
Andy Dwyer,Look what she gave us.
Andy Dwyer,Slow cooker!
April Ludgate,Great.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
April Ludgate,So hurry up and get ready.
April Ludgate,The gala starts in an hour.
April Ludgate,"And don't forget, tomorrow we have to go to that guy's office to sign the renters insurance forms."
April Ludgate,Get ready.
April Ludgate,Go.
Andy Dwyer,Everything is going great.
Andy Dwyer,April's kicking ass at her National Parks job.
Andy Dwyer,"I work there part time, and I have my own TV show."
Perd Hapley,Welcome back to the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show.
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Johnny."
Jerry Gergich,I have something for ya.
Andy Dwyer,It's Mailman Barry.
Andy Dwyer,"Morning, Barry."
Andy Dwyer,I have something for you.
Jerry Gergich,"Andy, no."
Andy Dwyer,Ninjas attack!
Jerry Gergich,Andy.
Jerry Gergich,No.
Jerry Gergich,That's my crotch.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, guys."
Andy Dwyer,Three more kicks apiece.
Leslie Knope,"Jessica, hi!"
Leslie Knope,I'm glad I caught you before you left.
Leslie Knope,"Just between you and me, what do you think your land might sell for tomorrow?"
Jessica Wicks,Trevor says it'll probably be around $90 million.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow!"
Jessica Wicks,I know!
Jessica Wicks,I am just-- I am so happy for me!
Leslie Knope,Would you ever consider giving the federal government a discount?
Leslie Knope,For a very good cause?
Leslie Knope,A National Park?
Jessica Wicks,"Oh, Leslie, I have always liked you."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, no, you haven't though."
Jessica Wicks,But I also like money.
Jessica Wicks,And money pays for my lifestyle.
Jessica Wicks,Leslie doesn't pay for my lifestyle.
Jessica Wicks,Money does.
Jessica Wicks,"So, between money and Leslie... You see the bind that I'm in?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's a tough one.
Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you, Jessica."
Leslie Knope,You did and said exactly what I thought you were gonna do and say.
Leslie Knope,And that's oddly comforting.
Jessica Wicks,"Thank you, sweetie!"
Tom Haverford,Who is Tom Haverford?
Tom Haverford,"He's a mentor, a lover, a hero."
Tom Haverford,But who is my hero?
Tom Haverford,Simple.
Tom Haverford,It's me five years from now.
Extra,"Okay, I really only need a correct spelling of your last name."
Tom Haverford,You are looking at one of Indiana Business Monthly's 35 under 35.
Tom Haverford,"I own Pawnee's hottest restaurant, two fast casual eateries, and the Tommy Chopper."
Tom Haverford,We serve chopped salads out of a decommissioned military helicopter.
Tom Haverford,I'm a mogul now!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."
Tom Haverford,Ben Wyatt!
Tom Haverford,City Manager of Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,The Chamber of Commerce asked me to introduce him at a very fancy black tie gala tonight.
Tom Haverford,"One of the many area bigwigs who comes to me for life advice, fashion tips... You get it."
Tom Haverford,Write this all down.
Ben Wyatt,"So, for the introduction, I'd love it if you could just keep it brief."
Ben Wyatt,Like stick to my fiscal accomplishments.
Tom Haverford,"Wanna wake me up when you're done boring us to death, am I right, Janet?"
Tom Haverford,Write down that I'm funny.
Tom Haverford,Benji.
Tom Haverford,Relax.
Tom Haverford,Come on.
Tom Haverford,When's Tommy ever let you down?
Ben Wyatt,Constantly.
Ben Wyatt,I'm being honored at a gala tonight because I'm in charge of the Pawnee Bicentennial Celebration.
Ben Wyatt,"It's my biggest project since Ice Town, so it really means a lot that I'm being recognized as a city leader instead of being yelled at and pelted with things."
Ben Wyatt,Wait.
Ben Wyatt,"You don't think this is all an elaborate setup to pelt me with things, do you?"
April Ludgate,"It takes, like, eight hours to cook something in this thing."
April Ludgate,I guess I could pick up a brisket tomorrow and start it for dinner Thursday.
Andy Dwyer,Thursday's no good.
Andy Dwyer,I have production meetings all day.
Andy Dwyer,I think we've got dinner with Joe and Donna on Friday.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know, Sunday, we can go to the farmer's market, put the brisket in the slow cooker, get a movie on Pay Per View."
Andy Dwyer,The new Jason Bourne movie is supposed to be pretty funny.
April Ludgate,"Andy, we're planning our whole week, like old people!"
April Ludgate,We used to be spontaneous and weird.
April Ludgate,We used to eat cereal out of Frisbees because we didn't have any bowls.
April Ludgate,You once broke a rib trying to wrestle one of those inflatable floppy guys at a car dealership.
Andy Dwyer,I won.
April Ludgate,Now you sprained your shoulder trying to clean out the stupid gutter.
April Ludgate,You even have a job.
April Ludgate,We have a bank account!
April Ludgate,That's it.
April Ludgate,"We've held out as long as we could, but it finally happened."
April Ludgate,We're boring.
April Ludgate,We're boring people who bore each other by being boring.
Andy Dwyer,No!
Andy Dwyer,We are still fun!
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna prove it to you.
Andy Dwyer,"Tonight, at the gala, we are gonna do something spontaneous and weird."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Stop taunting me.
Leslie Knope,Get on the phone to Washington.
Leslie Knope,Call in every favor that we have.
Leslie Knope,"Dave, put Missouri on the back burner, this is top priority."
Leslie Knope,"You all have 36 hours to find me 90 million dollars, go!"
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,90 million dollars?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I only have 2 million dollars in the discretionary fund, and I've already used some of it to make Thomas Jefferson sexier in those Mount Rushmore promotions."
Leslie Knope,"Which, by the way, attendance has been up."
Leslie Knope,That's not a coincidence.
Ben Wyatt,Pawnee's rich and famous will all be here tonight.
Ben Wyatt,Maybe you start there.
Leslie Knope,That is a very smart idea.
Leslie Knope,And that tuxedo makes you look like a sexy orchestra conductor.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,Wave this pen around.
Ben Wyatt,Focus.
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,Let's go get that park.
Leslie Knope,That park is my dream.
Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna let it slip away.
Leslie Knope,Who cares if Gryzzl and Ron have more money?
Leslie Knope,"I have the most valuable currency in America, a blind, stubborn belief that what I am doing is 100% right."
Leslie Knope,Ken Hotate!
Leslie Knope,Great bolo tie.
Leslie Knope,Is that new?
Ken Hotate,"Why, yes, it is."
Ken Hotate,My son sells them on Etsy.
Ken Hotate,He is a huge disappointment.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, now that we're chatting, the National Park Service is looking to buy the Newport Land, but we're a little short on funds."
Ken Hotate,How short?
Leslie Knope,88 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,What do you say you put some of that casino money to good use?
Ken Hotate,"You know, we have been considering opening a second resort."
Leslie Knope,"No, it would be a donation."
Leslie Knope,The government would keep the land.
Ken Hotate,So you would like the Wamapoke people to pay the federal government millions of dollars to buy land that was stolen from us by the federal government?
Ken Hotate,And we don't even get to keep the land?
Leslie Knope,"Well, when you put it like that, I see the irony."
Leslie Knope,"So, are you in?"
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,What if I buy some of your disappointing son's bolo ties?
Leslie Knope,Damn it.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, check it out."
Andy Dwyer,"I'm so crazy and spontaneous, I don't even need this sling anymore."
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that pop?
Andy Dwyer,Did you hear that?
Andy Dwyer,You wanna do shots?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I'd love to do a shot."
April Ludgate,'Cause wine makes me sleepy now.
Andy Dwyer,This is gonna be fun.
Andy Dwyer,What do you wanna do first?
April Ludgate,I dare you to eat this entire jug of olives.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
April Ludgate,What are you doing?
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna take a Zantac.
Andy Dwyer,All that salt will give me heartburn.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,You ruined it.
April Ludgate,We have to figure something else out.
Andy Dwyer,Should I still take the Zantac?
April Ludgate,"Yeah, you always feel better when you do."
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
April Ludgate,"I hate us, let's go."
Leslie Knope,"Now, I know all of you are off doing your own things, and we don't see each other as much as we used to, but I need my old team back for one last mission."
Leslie Knope,"So, hands in, ""Defeat Ron"" on three!"
Leslie Knope,"One, two, three."
Tom Haverford,"Oh, actually, Ron promised me I could build a restaurant on the new Gryzzl campus."
Tom Haverford,So I'm kind of totally on Ron's side.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom's dead to me."
Leslie Knope,Donna?
Leslie Knope,I'm waiting for your hand.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,Ron hired Regal Meagle Realty to broker the deal.
Donna Meagle,And I'm gonna need the money for my wedding.
Donna Meagle,Shia LaBeouf designed wedding dresses do not come cheap.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,You're getting married?
Leslie Knope,That's amazing!
Leslie Knope,And you didn't tell me earlier.
Leslie Knope,How could you?
Donna Meagle,Joe popped the question a few days ago.
Donna Meagle,I didn't post anything on Gryzzl Feed 'cause I wanted to tell you in person.
Leslie Knope,"It's very beautiful, and I'm furious at you."
Donna Meagle,How are you?
Donna Meagle,How are the kids?
Leslie Knope,They're great.
Leslie Knope,"You know, they're trying to destroy us."
Leslie Knope,"There's three of them, it's insane, but they're great."
Tom Haverford,"We gotta run, Les."
Tom Haverford,Sorry for totally crushing it and you in the process.
Tom Haverford,Later.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, never fear, because Terry is here."
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, I go by Terry now."
Jerry Gergich,Because there was a guy at National Parks.
Jerry Gergich,"He was already named Larry, so they suggested I go by Terry."
Jerry Gergich,"And then I said my real name is Gary, and they said, ""Who cares?"""
Jerry Gergich,"So, it's just a fun group."
Tom Haverford,Good evening and welcome to the Pawnee Bicentennial Gala.
Tom Haverford,"Not long ago, this town was barely on the map."
Tom Haverford,Unless you're talking about a map of the cities with the most obese pets.
Tom Haverford,But then one great man came along and he lifted all of us up.
Tom Haverford,And that man was me.
Tom Haverford,"Tom Haverford, owner and proprietor of the effortlessly chic, celebrity packed Italian restaurant, Tom's Bistro."
Tom Haverford,And several other establishments.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, how could you?"
Ron Swanson,I simply took a skewer for one shrimp and added many shrimp to it.
Ron Swanson,They're long enough for five or six.
Leslie Knope,"First you try to steal my park, and now you steal my team?"
Ron Swanson,I didn't steal them.
Ron Swanson,"They're independent people who have moved on to better things, just like you did."
Ron Swanson,Bacon wrapped shrimp?
Ron Swanson,I fit seven on this one.
Ron Swanson,It's a masterpiece.
Leslie Knope,"Why don't you shove them all in your dumb mouth and then when I turn around, you can stab me in the back with the skewer?"
Tom Haverford,"People come up to me, and they say things like, ""Tom, given all that you've accomplished, is it hard to stay humble?"""
Tom Haverford,"And I say, ""Not for me."""
Tom Haverford,"""I'm pretty amazing at being humble."""
Tom Haverford,But enough about me.
Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Pawnee's Man of the Year 2017, Mr. Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks.
Ben Wyatt,And thank you to Tom for that moving tribute to you.
Ben Wyatt,And thank you to the Boys and Girls Club for the incredibly lifelike papier-mache statue.
Ben Wyatt,"You know when I first moved here, I…"
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, uh I guess it's time for cake?"
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Perfect timing.
Andy Dwyer,How about this?
Andy Dwyer,"We shut off the lights, turn 'em back on."
Andy Dwyer,Everybody's fancy jewelry is missing.
Andy Dwyer,"Meanwhile, you and I are already on a boat to the airport."
April Ludgate,Let's put stink bombs in all the vents.
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
April Ludgate,Wait.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,I forgot.
April Ludgate,I got rid of all the stink bombs before I babysat Leslie's kids.
April Ludgate,Being responsible adults sucks butts.
Andy Dwyer,Butts.
Andy Dwyer,That's it.
Andy Dwyer,I'll streak across the stage.
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,I love it.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get naked.
Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna get up there.
Andy Dwyer,Everyone is gonna see my wiener.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, you've seen it."
Andy Dwyer,You know how dumb it looks.
April Ludgate,Uh-huh.
Andy Dwyer,Perfect plan.
Leslie Knope,Why are you even here?
Leslie Knope,What have you ever done for this city?
Ron Swanson,My company has stimulated Pawnee's economy.
Ron Swanson,You're just still upset about Morningstar.
Leslie Knope,I told you to never say that word to me!
Leslie Knope,No one should ever say that word out loud.
Leslie Knope,"It's like ""Voldemort"" or ""Ron."""
Leslie Knope,You know what?
Leslie Knope,You don't deserve that candle!
Leslie Knope,Give me that candle!
Ron Swanson,Let go!
Ron Swanson,Let go!
Leslie Knope,This candle's mine!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,Gimme this candle.
Leslie Knope,"You steal my team, I steal your candle!"
Ron Swanson,I stole nothing!
Ben Wyatt,Guys!
Leslie Knope,I want it!
Ron Swanson,Leslie!
Leslie Knope,Stop!
Leslie Knope,It's okay.
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
Leslie Knope,Just wheel out the backup cake.
Ben Wyatt,There's no backup cake.
Leslie Knope,Who doesn't bake a backup cake?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"Well, that seals it."
April Ludgate,Even Leslie is crazier than we are.
Andy Dwyer,"They're still gonna serve that cake, right?"
Tom Haverford,"And then I said, ""Uh, you might wanna check with the penguin."""
Trevor Nelson,I get it.
Jessica Wicks,You Gryzzl guys are a real hoot.
Jessica Wicks,And you have so much money.
Mike Bean,"Thanks, Jessie!"
Mike Bean,"And, hey, enjoy that new prototype Gryzzl Tablet."
Jessica Wicks,I will.
Jessica Wicks,I just love it!
Extra,"Thank you, Jessica."
Extra,"I love you, too."
Extra,I love your skin.
Extra,Give me your skin.
Jessica Wicks,Oh!
Mike Bean,There are still a couple bugs with the Al software.
Mike Bean,But maybe just turn it off before you go to sleep.
Tom Haverford,"All right, Donna."
Tom Haverford,Let's hit it.
Tom Haverford,About to get some peddies!
Donna Meagle,Peddies on peddies on peddies.
Jessica Wicks, Okay.
Jessica Wicks, You're next.
Leslie Knope," Hello, Ron."
Leslie Knope, I just want you to know that I am not sorry that I pushed you into a giant cake.
Ron Swanson," Well, I am sorry that I attended a public event."
Mike Bean," Yo, Ron."
Mike Bean," Come on, bud."
Mike Bean," We're gonna go play some video games, and we want you to watch quietly."
April Ludgate," After we drop off the renters insurance forms, we need to stop by the grocery store."
April Ludgate, And then we need to sign a suicide pact because our lives are meaningless.
Andy Dwyer," Babe, we are not boring people."
Andy Dwyer," Would boring people get renters insurance, even though it's not legally required?"
Andy Dwyer,Where are we? I have never once been to this part of Pawnee.
April Ludgate, It's the creepy warehouse district.
April Ludgate, It's mostly just raccoons and old car batteries.
April Ludgate, Whoa! Hang on.
April Ludgate, Pull over.
April Ludgate, Look at that.
April Ludgate, This place is amazing.
April Ludgate, Let's go in!
Tom Haverford,"What up, playa? I just wanted to apologize for my intro running long."
Tom Haverford," But, you know, when it comes to inspirational Will Smith quotes, how you gonna stop at 10?"
Ben Wyatt,"You know, when the Chamber of Commerce asked you to introduce me, I was a little worried you would spend the entire time talking about yourself, which is exactly what you did."
Tom Haverford, I'm sorry.
Tom Haverford, Truth is they didn't ask me to introduce you.
Tom Haverford, I asked them if I could do it.
Tom Haverford," I was gonna talk about how I owe you so much, and how you stood by me through all of my failures, and I stood by you through all of your terrible outfits."
Tom Haverford," But when I got up there, I got pretty emotional."
Tom Haverford," To make it up to you, I'd like to read you the speech now."
Tom Haverford," ""I've known a lot of ballers in my day."""
Tom Haverford," ""But no man balls harder than the man I'm about to bring up."""
Tom Haverford," ""He's kind."""
Tom Haverford," ""He's intelligent."""
Tom Haverford," ""He's a person I'm deeply proud to call my friend."""
Ben Wyatt,It was a pretty good speech.
Ben Wyatt," I mean, it was a little sappy maybe."
Ben Wyatt, But I think I liked it.
Leslie Knope," Jessica, Mr. Nelson, you are going to hear a lot of bids today."
Leslie Knope, But this is the only one that matters.
Jessica Wicks, Is this a circle? Or is it an O?
Jessica Wicks,Is Oprah involved in your bid?
Leslie Knope,It's a zero.
Leslie Knope, I bid zero dollars.
Trevor Nelson," I have to say, that's one of the lower ones we've seen."
Leslie Knope," Pawnee is celebrating its 200th anniversary, and the Newport family has been here since day one."
Leslie Knope," Through feast and famine, transformation, upheaval, celebration."
Leslie Knope, The Newport family is part of the fabric of this town.
Leslie Knope," And not always in a good way, like when your hot fudge pipeline exploded."
Jessica Wicks," Oh, boo-hoo! It all ran off into the lake."
Leslie Knope," Well, yes, admittedly, it did make the fish taste delicious, but it was a PR nightmare."
Jessica Wicks, Mmm-hmm.
Leslie Knope, My question is this.
Leslie Knope, What do you want the Newport name to mean in the future?
Leslie Knope,"If you donate this land, and you let me turn it into a national park, the Newport National Park, your name will stand for something good for generations to come."
Jessica Wicks, How much was her bid again?
Trevor Nelson,It was zero dollars.
Jessica Wicks, Oh! That's the part I don't like.
Trevor Nelson, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Just keep me in the running.
Leslie Knope, Give me a chance to prove to you how great this could be.
Andy Dwyer," It says here there are 12 closets, three bomb shelters, five dumbwaiters, two and three-eighths baths, no kitchens."
Andy Dwyer, It's a fairly standard layout.
April Ludgate, Cool.
April Ludgate, Is that a staircase to nowhere?
Extra,"Yes, it is."
Extra, Good eye.
Andy Dwyer, What was this place?
Extra,Remember the Pawnee Doll Head Factory?
April Ludgate,This was a doll head factory?
Extra,No.
Extra, This was a holding cell for people who went insane on the assembly line.
Andy Dwyer, What's behind this door?
Andy Dwyer,Fire pole!
April Ludgate,So this place has had zero offers?
Extra,"People seem to be scared off, on account of it being haunted and disgusting."
Extra," After 47 years living here, I decided to move to Orlando to be closer to Disney World."
Andy Dwyer, We are responsible adults.
Andy Dwyer, You know what that means?
April Ludgate,I know.
Andy Dwyer, We have money.
Andy Dwyer, And we are going to buy the [bleep] out of this house!
April Ludgate,Seriously?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer, Who needs rental insurance? We're gonna live here.
Extra, We now go live to the press conference.
Trevor Nelson, Good evening.
Trevor Nelson," I'm Attorney Trevor Nelsson with the law firm Fwar, Dips, Winshares, Gritt, Babip, Pecota, Vorp and Eckstein, legal counsel to the Newport family, here to announce that the Newport Family Trust has narrowed this search to two final candidates, the Gryzzl corporation and the National Park Service."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, I'm in the game.
Leslie Knope, All I have to do is convince them that it's better taking no money than taking 90 million dollars.
Ben Wyatt," Well, you did convince three unsuspecting toddlers that peas turn into cupcakes in their tummies."
Leslie Knope, I started my career in Pawnee by turning a pit into a cool little park.
Leslie Knope," And now I have the chance to give this town a massive, beautiful gift that they can use forever."
Leslie Knope," In the words of Jason Bourne, ""This is where it started for me."""
Leslie Knope," ""This is where it ends."""
Ben Wyatt,"You know, I still think Kevin James was a weird choice for the reboot."
Leslie Knope," Oh, I don't."
Leslie Knope, I think he nailed it.
Tom Haverford," So, I'm thinking, in addition, to the Tom's Bistros, we have a hyper exclusive lounge area called Tommy's Lounge."
Leslie Knope, Attention! This is war.
Leslie Knope, You guys are going down.
Leslie Knope, And that's all I wanted to say.
Leslie Knope," Except Donna, Tom, hey."
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry I haven't kept in better touch with you recently, but, you know, I've been a little preoccupied with my kids and my job."
Leslie Knope," So, it's really good to see you both."
Leslie Knope," And also, prepare for war because you chose the wrong side and we are gonna smoke you."
Leslie Knope," And also I made cookies, but Ron is not allowed to eat them and they say, ""Prepare for War"" on them, but the O in the word ""for"" is a heart."
Andy Dwyer, And I ate a lot of 'em on the way over here.
Andy Dwyer, Because we're at war.
Andy Dwyer," Hey, Tom!"
Tom Haverford,"Hey, man!"
Andy Dwyer,"Buddy, good to see you."
Andy Dwyer, How's it going?
Tom Haverford,It's pretty good.
Leslie Knope, Hey! Andy! Let's go.
Leslie Knope, War!

,Season: 7 Episode: 02
Jeremy Jamm,"Knopey, my girl, wuddup?"
Jeremy Jamm,I just farted.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jeremy."
Leslie Knope,I truly thought that I would never have to interact with you again.
Jeremy Jamm,"I missed you, too."
Leslie Knope,The city council is voting on whether to rezone the Newport land for commercial use.
Leslie Knope,"If I win, stupid Gryzzl and stupid Ron can't build anything there, and then I'm sitting pretty."
Leslie Knope,"Sadly, the deciding vote is from my old city council mate, and human equivalent of gas station sushi, Jeremy Jamm."
Leslie Knope,"So, I am here to talk to you about why you should vote ""No"" in the zoning issue."
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hold up, little chica."
Jeremy Jamm,"Before we go any further, I need to ask my girlfriend how she wants me to vote."
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,Who's your girlfriend?
Tammy 2,"Hello, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Tammy.
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Jamm and Tammy!
Leslie Knope,"""Jammy."""
Jeremy Jamm,Jammy.
Leslie Knope,You guys are so cute.
Leslie Knope,"When did you-- Why would either one of you, you know-- Why?"
Leslie Knope,"Dear God, why?"
Jeremy Jamm,Hit it off at karaoke.
Jeremy Jamm,"She saw me nail Gangsta's Paradise, I saw her bite the door guy."
Jeremy Jamm,She then let me buy her a bunch of purses.
Jeremy Jamm,And the rest is history.
Tammy 2,A bunch.
Leslie Knope,Wait a second.
Leslie Knope,This is great news.
Leslie Knope,Because Ron is my opponent in this.
Leslie Knope,And you live to torture Ron.
Leslie Knope,Vote for me so that you can screw Ron over.
Tammy 2,Maybe you're not a blonde bimbo after all.
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Tammy 2,Well.
Tammy 2,Let me mull it over.
Leslie Knope,"Sure, I'm aligning myself with terrible people, but think of all the wonderful people who will benefit from a national park."
Leslie Knope,It's worth it.
Leslie Knope,"And you can trust my opinion because I have a lot to gain by being right, and I have severe tunnel vision about achieving my goals."
Ben Wyatt,"Joan, on behalf of the entire city, congratulations."
Ben Wyatt,I do want to apologize for not being able to accommodate some of your requests.
Ben Wyatt,"For example, we couldn't get a bottle of Chateau Marmont because it's a hotel in Los Angeles, not a wine."
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, did you at least get Buddy Holly to sing?"
Ben Wyatt,"No, because he's been famously dead for 60 years."
Joan Callamezzo,What?
April Ludgate,"Hi, Joan."
April Ludgate,"Hi, my name is April."
April Ludgate,And I'm your biggest fan and I pretty much hate everyone.
April Ludgate,Will you sign your ninth memoir for me?
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, it would be my pleasure."
Joan Callamezzo,You said your name was Glenn?
April Ludgate,"Yes, I did."
Joan Callamezzo,That's pretty.
April Ludgate,"Joan has always been kind of a train wreck, but the last three years, she's gone off the deep end."
April Ludgate,She did a string of shows from rehab.
Joan Callamezzo,"Victoria Herzog, you were a successful attorney from Wilmington, Delaware."
Joan Callamezzo,Then you hit rock bottom.
Extra,This is supposed to be anonymous.
April Ludgate,She once gave every member in her audience a car.
April Ludgate,"One car, that they all had to fight for."
April Ludgate,"Oh, and last year, she did a show where she called all of her exboyfriends while sitting on a washing machine."
Joan Callamezzo,"Well, Erik, if you didn't give it to me, then who did?"
April Ludgate,I love her so much.
April Ludgate,I hope she's my real mom.
Andy Dwyer,"""Entrepreneur bachelor, Tom Haverford, is making quite a splash in the culinary world, and we expect even bigger things from him in 2018."""
Andy Dwyer,Tom.
Andy Dwyer,What does culinary mean?
Tom Haverford,It means it's a cause for celebration.
Tom Haverford,"Round of drinks for everyone, on the house!"
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Andy Dwyer,Let me also get a chicken parm and a lasagna on the side.
Andy Dwyer,And a spaghetti to go.
Andy Dwyer,On the house!
Extra,Yes.
Tom Haverford,That's the fourth engagement this month.
Tom Haverford,"I'm tired of being an ""Entrepreneur/bachelor."""
Tom Haverford,I need to find someone.
Andy Dwyer,"Are you bummed, Tom?"
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, I got a quick fix for that."
Andy Dwyer,Let's get hammered.
Andy Dwyer,Everything here is free.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Miss Knope.
Ron Swanson,How's that zero dollar bid coming along?
Ron Swanson,"You know, in my experience with capitalism, people would normally expect money in exchange for their goods and land."
Leslie Knope,"In my experience with butt faces, you are one."
Councilman Howser,We will now hear arguments about the Newport property.
Councilman Howser,"First, on behalf of Gryzzl, Mr. Ron Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Councilman."
Ron Swanson,"When you vote tomorrow, we believe you should vote to rezone the land for commercial use."
Jeremy Jamm,"Well, I'm convinced."
Jeremy Jamm,"Tomorrow, I'm voting for Gryzzl."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,I didn't even get a chance to say my plan.
Jeremy Jamm,Your plan?
Jeremy Jamm,You know who else had a plan?
Leslie Knope,Please don't say Hitler.
Jeremy Jamm,Adolf Hitler!
Jeremy Jamm,I'm with Swanson.
Jeremy Jamm,It's a stache thing.
Jeremy Jamm,Stache bros.
Jeremy Jamm,You wouldn't understand.
Jeremy Jamm,We're done here.
Ron Swanson,"Well, that was easy."
Leslie Knope,What the hell just happened?
Joan Callamezzo,"Thank you, Commissioner Gordon, people of Gotham."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,She thinks she's in Batman.
Joan Callamezzo,"People often ask me, ""Joan, how do you do it?"""
Joan Callamezzo,It's simple.
Joan Callamezzo,I love being on TV.
Joan Callamezzo,I've known what I've wanted to do since I was 10 years old.
Joan Callamezzo,That is the key to living a good life.
Joan Callamezzo,"If you don't absolutely love what you do with a true passion, then what's the point in doing it at all?"
Joan Callamezzo,"On a separate note, I think that America should have a purge night."
Joan Callamezzo,Let me explain why.
April Ludgate,Do I even like my job?
Tom Haverford,"I must be the first person ever to have money, power, and notoriety, but still feel empty."
Tom Haverford,I need someone to share my life with.
Andy Dwyer,What if your future wife is somebody that you already know?
Andy Dwyer,Let's open your Gryzzl page.
Andy Dwyer,What about her?
Andy Dwyer,She's cute.
Andy Dwyer,Date her.
Tom Haverford,That's my cousin.
Andy Dwyer,How about her?
Tom Haverford,That's my dad!
Tom Haverford,What's wrong with you?
Andy Dwyer,"I'm drunk, okay?"
Andy Dwyer,Why are you only friends with your family?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look, you got a message from somebody named Lucy in Chicago."
Andy Dwyer,She looks familiar.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, we used to date."
Tom Haverford,I was super into her.
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's not it."
Andy Dwyer,Was she in Destiny's Child?
Tom Haverford,"""Hey Tom, saw the article, you boss!"""
Tom Haverford,"""Let's catch up soon."""
Tom Haverford,"""Miss you."""
Andy Dwyer,Do you realize what's happening?
Andy Dwyer,We've been sitting here searching for your soul mate this whole time and then Lucy just Gryzzl-texts you out of nowhere?
Andy Dwyer,It's a sign!
Andy Dwyer,And we have to catch it.
Andy Dwyer,We are going to Chicago.
Tom Haverford,Andy?
Tom Haverford,Think about what you're saying right now.
Tom Haverford,'Cause it's the smartest idea anyone's ever had!
Tom Haverford,Let's go!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah!
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Leslie Knope,What did you do?
Ron Swanson,I delivered a flawless presentation and secured tomorrow's vote.
Leslie Knope,"No, you got all sneaky and snuck around and snooked that vote away from me."
Leslie Knope,And I know this because earlier I sneaked and snooked around and Jammy was supposed to vote for me!
Leslie Knope,The snooker has become the snorked!
Ron Swanson,What are you talking--
Ron Swanson,She's near.
Tammy 2,"Hey, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Tammy.
Ron Swanson,"So, you two are together now."
Ron Swanson,My condolences to both of you.
Leslie Knope,You guys were supposed to vote for me.
Tammy 2,"Leslie, I would never do anything to help you."
Tammy 2,You've always been against me and Ron.
Tammy 2,"You're a big part of the reason that he and I aren't together, and I had to settle for this placeholder."
Jeremy Jamm,I love you so much.
Leslie Knope,So you thought if you voted for Ron you could actually win him back?
Tammy 2,Yeah.
Tammy 2,That's right.
Tammy 2,"Did it work, baby?"
Tammy 2,Are you horny with gratitude?
Ron Swanson,You two more than deserve each other.
Ron Swanson,Good luck.
Leslie Knope,The vote is tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"If I don't get Jamm out from Tammy's clutches, I'm doomed."
Leslie Knope,It's like rescuing a bunny from a lion.
Leslie Knope,But that lion is a demonic sociopath with really nice cleavage.
Extra,"All right, we're here."
Tom Haverford,"Sir, where the hell are we?"
Extra,Chicago.
Extra,That'll be 830 dollars.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, no!"
Tom Haverford,This is so dumb!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, awesome."
Tom Haverford,Turn the car around.
Tom Haverford,We're going back home.
Extra,No way.
Extra,Pay me.
Extra,And get the hell outta my cab.
Andy Dwyer,Pay the man.
Andy Dwyer,Chicago!
Andy Dwyer,The big apple.
Tom Haverford,"Well, that's where Lucy works."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah?
Tom Haverford,We must've given the cabbie the address.
Tom Haverford,"Let's just get something to eat, and fly home."
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,We came all this way.
Andy Dwyer,"Tom, we should at least say hi."
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,You can't not talk to someone for five years and then show up unannounced where they work in a different city.
Tom Haverford,That's what murderers do before they murder someone.
Lucy,Tom?
Lucy,I thought that was you.
Lucy,What are you doing here?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, uh--"
Lucy,"You're not gonna murder me, are you?"
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,I'm here doin' stuff.
Andy Dwyer,Um Lucy.
Andy Dwyer,Hey.
Andy Dwyer,"Andy Dwyer, remember me?"
Lucy,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,He's here helping me find a place to live.
Andy Dwyer,I just got a job here.
Andy Dwyer,"And then when you hit him up on Gryzzl, he was like, ""Let's go say hi to Lucy since we're already here in Chicago."""
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,That's the deal.
Lucy,"Cool, what job is it?"
Andy Dwyer,Head coach of the Chicago Bulls.
Tom Haverford,"No, he's working at a nonprofit."
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Am I?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, that sucks."
Lucy,"Well, listen, I got some stuff I gotta do in the office, but I wanna hang out."
Lucy,Do you wanna meet me here in an hour?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, that sounds great."
Tom Haverford,We'll go a little Chicago deep dish pizza.
Tom Haverford,And go watch the Bears.
Lucy,No.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry I started doing that.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, April."
Ben Wyatt,How's it going?
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Except hearing Joan talk about her passion and doing what you really love totally freaked me out.
April Ludgate,"Eight years ago, I accepted a random internship at the parks department, and then Leslie told me to do a bunch of stuff, and now I'm executive director of regional whatever, and I don't even know what it means."
April Ludgate,And I never even asked myself if I even really like it.
April Ludgate,"I mean, it's like, what is my purpose in life?"
April Ludgate,What do I even care about?
April Ludgate,My insides are dying.
Ben Wyatt,"So, not fine."
April Ludgate,I don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,I have to quit.
Ben Wyatt,To do what?
April Ludgate,I'm just gonna go live under a bridge and ask people riddles before they cross.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, hold on."
Ben Wyatt,Do you remember what Joan said at the ceremony?
April Ludgate,That it doesn't count as stripping if no one pays you?
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, she did say that."
Ben Wyatt,But no.
Ben Wyatt,She knew she wanted to be on TV when she was 10.
Ben Wyatt,"So, what did you wanna be when you were 10?"
April Ludgate,It says here the future of caskets may just be biodegradable plastic.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, you don't say."
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,Are you chilly?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm a little chilly, I think."
April Ludgate,No.
Dan,"Hey, guys."
Dan,Welcome.
Dan,I'm Dan.
Ben Wyatt,Hi.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm Ben, this is April."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm scared of death.
April Ludgate,I'm just really interested in learning what you do.
Dan,You're gonna love it here.
Dan,People are dying to get in.
Dan,"Come on, come on."
Dan,We'll start down at the cadaver chute!
April Ludgate,The cadaver chute.
April Ludgate,Come on!
Leslie Knope,So this is where you wanna eat lunch?
Leslie Knope,In a steakhouse?
Leslie Knope,Don't you have irritable bowel syndrome?
Leslie Knope,"God, I hate that I know that."
Jeremy Jamm,"Yeah, it's murder on the old plumbing."
Jeremy Jamm,But Tammy only wants me to eat steak and whiskey.
Jeremy Jamm,She has my stool analyzed just to keep me honest.
Leslie Knope,I don't think this relationship is that healthy.
Leslie Knope,I mean it seems like Tammy is trying to turn you into Ron.
Leslie Knope,And you're Jeremy Jamm!
Leslie Knope,"I mean, come on."
Leslie Knope,You love Porsches and spiked iced tea.
Leslie Knope,And you have a Hooters platinum card.
Jeremy Jamm,Yeah.
Jeremy Jamm,Tammy doesn't really let me do that stuff anymore.
Jeremy Jamm,"But, you know, it's good, you know?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm better now.
Jeremy Jamm,"I mean, sure, I'm depressed, and I'm constantly sick, and nothing really brings me joy."
Jeremy Jamm,But it just feels right.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Jeremy Jamm,"Help me, Knope."
Jeremy Jamm,I used to be so great.
Jeremy Jamm,Remember?
Jeremy Jamm,Everybody thought so.
Leslie Knope,Well--
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,This is worse than I thought.
Leslie Knope,You're broken.
Leslie Knope,She has broken you.
Leslie Knope,You need to get away from her.
Jeremy Jamm,"Oh, God!"
Jeremy Jamm,Whoa!
Jeremy Jamm,"Hey, look at that."
Jeremy Jamm,More hair came out.
Lucy,"Yeah, I think you're really gonna like it here."
Lucy,"And obviously, everyone's in a really great mood now because of the Cubs winning the series."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,It seems really nice.
Andy Dwyer,"I mean, I am gonna miss Pawnee, though."
Andy Dwyer,My wife's there for cryin' out loud.
Lucy,"Yeah, tell me about Pawnee."
Lucy,It sounds like it's really changed.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah."
Tom Haverford,There's a ton of new businesses.
Tom Haverford,"Gryzzl came in, they gave everyone free tablets and WiFi and phones."
Tom Haverford,"You can watch Hitch 2  anytime, anywhere!"
Lucy,Finally!
Lucy,That's the dream.
Lucy,"Part of me wants to go back, you know."
Lucy,I always kinda liked it there.
Andy Dwyer,"Man, you got me really missing Pawnee now."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to do.
Andy Dwyer,Am I making the right decision?
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Ron Swanson,Why are you here?
Leslie Knope,I'm calling a temporary truce.
Leslie Knope,You need to help me break up Jamm and Tammy.
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,You just want Jamm to switch his vote.
Ron Swanson,"What is this, revenge for Morningstar?"
Leslie Knope,"No, it is not about that."
Leslie Knope,It's not about the vote.
Leslie Knope,There is a guy in real trouble and you might be the only one who can help him.
Leslie Knope,This is about saving someone's soul.
Ron Swanson,He is a monster.
Ron Swanson,Monsters do not have souls.
Leslie Knope,"Uh, have you ever seen Monsters, Inc.?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,Engage in the culture once in a while!
Leslie Knope,Jamm!
Leslie Knope,Get in here!
Ron Swanson,"Good God, man, what happened to you?"
Leslie Knope,Tammy happened to him!
Leslie Knope,"Remind you of anyone, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,We need to put our issues aside and defend this miserable person!
Ron Swanson,Jeremy.
Ron Swanson,This is a gold bar.
Leslie Knope,You keep that in your desk?
Ron Swanson,I will give you this gold bar if you say one unflattering thing about Tammy.
Jeremy Jamm,"If I do, does Tammy get to keep the gold?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Ron Swanson,"When it comes to Tammy, the code is the same as that of the battlefield."
Ron Swanson,"First, you leave no man behind."
Ron Swanson,"Second, you must protect yourself against chemical warfare."
Ron Swanson,Tammy does not abide by the Geneva Convention.
Ron Swanson,I made this Tammy deprogramming kit in case I ever fell victim to her again.
Ron Swanson,"First, this is a chastity belt that I made by hand."
Ron Swanson,"It might be a couple sizes too big for you, but you can just pad it."
Ron Swanson,The first step is to cut out all sex.
Jeremy Jamm,That won't be necessary.
Jeremy Jamm,We haven't done the deed yet.
Jeremy Jamm,She lets me rub up against her leg sometimes.
Ron Swanson,"Well, all the more reason to wear it."
Ron Swanson,"She knows she has that card left to play, and you best believe she will."
Leslie Knope,We're also gonna try a Pavlovian technique.
Leslie Knope,"Ron is holding Tammy's perfume, Girth."
Jeremy Jamm,Oh.
Jeremy Jamm,It smells good.
Leslie Knope,Again.
Jeremy Jamm,Tammy.
Jeremy Jamm,How many times are we gonna do this?
Leslie Knope,Until the bottle is empty.
Leslie Knope,Again.
Leslie Knope,Twice.
Jeremy Jamm,Tam-- No!
Ron Swanson,It's going well so far but it's too early to tell.
Ron Swanson,He was pretty far gone.
Dan,"Hopefully, we get a body in today so I can show you guys the really fun part."
Dan,Draining!
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God!"
Ben Wyatt,I hate this so much.
April Ludgate,Cool.
April Ludgate,Can I touch a dead body?
Dan,Whoa!
Dan,"Slow down, eager beaver!"
Dan,That doesn't happen for at least a year.
April Ludgate,Why?
April Ludgate,How did you become a mortician?
April Ludgate,Can't I just sign up?
Dan,"Oh, gosh, no!"
Dan,You need two years of school and a year long apprenticeship.
Dan,The first few years are mostly paperwork and filing.
April Ludgate,Why is every job just paperwork?
Dan,"Hey, it's a living."
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"I think we're gonna go, Dan."
April Ludgate,The reality of your life is incredibly depressing.
April Ludgate,"I'm just gonna stay at my current job until I get old and die and then end up here, being embalmed by some weirdo who had to go to school for three years just to cut my guts open."
April Ludgate,Let's go.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God!"
Dan,"Okay, have a good one."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We're gonna do some scenes and demonstrate ways that you can resist Tammy.
Leslie Knope,"I will play Tammy, Ron will play you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey there, horsey."
Leslie Knope,Time to mount up and ride on into Bonertown.
Leslie Knope,"What do you say we get stanky in that pet store bathroom, Jamm?"
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Jeremy Jamm,Do it.
Ron Swanson,"There will be no sex today, Tammy."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Ron Swanson,"Instead, why don't you go into the pet store and feed yourself to the snakes?"
Ron Swanson," To hell with you woman, goodbye."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, ya big hunk of wiener meat."
Leslie Knope," I've got forty hand towels, some energy bars, and a Chinese finger trap."
Leslie Knope, Let's get gross.
Ron Swanson,This gambit has failed.
Ron Swanson," To hell with you woman, goodbye."
Jeremy Jamm,What are you wearing?
Ron Swanson,It's a crotch blinder of my own design.
Ron Swanson," In this scenario, she will be coming at you pants-less."
Jeremy Jamm," Okay, the doors are locked, windows secured, there is no way Tammy's getting in here."
Leslie Knope," ""Jamm! Strip down, you sex maggot!"""
Ron Swanson,And hold! What was your mistake? You didn't check the armoire.
Ron Swanson, Tammy once camped out in my attic for six days awaiting my arrival.
Ron Swanson, She survived on rats and rainwater.
Ron Swanson, Let's run it again!
Tom Haverford,"I gotta say, hanging out with Lucy's been so fun."
Tom Haverford, She's the best.
Andy Dwyer," And I love that she's buying us stuff! Dude, make your move."
Andy Dwyer, Ask her out.
Tom Haverford," I dunno, she lives here."
Tom Haverford, How would it even work?
Andy Dwyer,Life is about taking risks.
Andy Dwyer," Look at me, Tom."
Andy Dwyer, I'm moving to Chicago!
Tom Haverford,It's just us right now.
Tom Haverford, Do you really think you're moving here?
Lucy,"One XXL, one kid's XL."
Tom Haverford, Hey! You remembered my size!
Lucy,Yeah.
Tom Haverford, Thank you.
Lucy, You're welcome.
Tom Haverford," Hey, Lucy, can I ask you something?"
Lucy,"Of course, what's up?"
Tom Haverford,"I was wondering would you wanna maybe... Come work for me in Pawnee? I got the company and it's growing so fast, I can't do it all myself."
Tom Haverford," And I need a manager, and you're a perfect candidate."
Lucy," Wow, really? That does sound kinda awesome."
Lucy, And it'd be super fun to work with you.
Lucy," I mean, I'd have to talk to my boyfriend about it first, but…"
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, of course! This is all perfect, and everything's worked out just as I'd hoped."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, this is why they call it Beantown, huh?"
Tammy 2,"Hey, Jerebear."
Tammy 2, What are you doing with these two jabronis?
Jeremy Jamm,"Tammy, I've given this a lot of thought."
Jeremy Jamm, We should break up.
Tammy 2," What's the matter, little boy? Did the bad people get to you?"
Jeremy Jamm,They just made me realize how unhealthy this is.
Jeremy Jamm, Literally.
Jeremy Jamm," All the steak and whiskey, I have to wear a diaper."
Tammy 2, That's 'cause you're my widdle baby!
Leslie Knope,"We drilled you on this, Jamm! Baby talk, what do you do?"
Jeremy Jamm,I'm not a baby! I'm a big boy!
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, okay."
Leslie Knope," Well, that wasn't terrible."
Tammy 2," Don't listen to Leslie, she's just trying to manipulate you."
Tammy 2, All she cares about is herself and I can prove it.
Tammy 2," How's this, Leslie? You leave us alone, and we swing the vote to you."
Tammy 2, Help you get your park.
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, Nice try.
Leslie Knope," Stay strong, Jeremy."
Jeremy Jamm," It's over, Tammy."
Tammy 2, Tell you what.
Tammy 2, It's been long enough.
Tammy 2, What do you say we consummate our relationship tonight? Huh? Let's do it.
Ron Swanson, And the last card is played.
Leslie Knope, What are you doing?
Extra,This is a library!
Leslie Knope,Do you see what's happening here?
Jeremy Jamm,Ron. I need that crotch blinder!
Ron Swanson,"No, you don't."
Ron Swanson, Just end it.
Tammy 2, Look at my boobs.
Jeremy Jamm, No.
Tammy 2, Look downstairs.
Jeremy Jamm, No.
Tammy 2, There's a prize inside for you.
Jeremy Jamm," It's over, Tammy."
Tammy 2, What?
Jeremy Jamm,"To hell with you, woman."
Jeremy Jamm, Goodbye.
Tammy 2, How dare you? Are you kidding me? You'll be back.
Tammy 2, They all come back! They call come back!
Ron Swanson,"Well done, Jeremy."
Ron Swanson, Turns out the crotch blinder was inside you all along.
Tammy 2," Come on, everybody! Who wants to get it on? I'm naked."
April Ludgate," Donna, what do I do? If working around corpses isn't even right for me, then nothing is."
April Ludgate, I feel totally lost.
Donna Meagle, Saturn's Return.
April Ludgate, What?
Donna Meagle,"Saturn's orbit around the sun takes roughly 29 years, and when it gets back to where it was when you were born, lots of turmoil, self-discovery."
Donna Meagle," When I was your age, I got banned from every riverboat in Germany."
Ben Wyatt, Donna.
Ben Wyatt, April.
Ben Wyatt, What're you up to?
April Ludgate,"Oh, you know."
April Ludgate, Just regionally directing the Midwest whatever of who cares.
Jerry Gergich, Isn't it great? Can you believe that they pay me for this? Because I would do this for free.
Jerry Gergich, Jeez!
Donna Meagle,"I do miss you, Terry."
Donna Meagle, Let me get you some napkins.
Ben Wyatt, April.
Ben Wyatt, You looked at one horrifying job.
Ben Wyatt, I've got a few more ideas.
Ben Wyatt, We'll find you something you like.
Ben Wyatt, Okay?
April Ludgate,"Okay, but you can't tell Leslie I might leave."
April Ludgate, She'll have a heart attack.
April Ludgate, Promise?
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
April Ludgate, Why are you so into helping me right now?
Ben Wyatt,"Because I'm finally doing what I love, and I know how hard it is to get to that place."
Ben Wyatt," And I want you to be happy, because you're my friend."
April Ludgate," No, I'm not."
April Ludgate, I've never cared for you.
April Ludgate," Wait, wait."
Ben Wyatt, You're behaving very strangely.
Donna Meagle, Saturn's Return.
Jeremy Jamm," Hey, Brokemons."
Jeremy Jamm, I just wanted to let you know that I will be abstaining from the vote today.
Jeremy Jamm, You are my two all-time best friends.
Jeremy Jamm, And you brought me back from the brink.
Jeremy Jamm," So, I can't choose sides."
Jeremy Jamm," Although, if I had to pick one side, it would be Lucy Liu's backside."
Leslie Knope," Without Jamm, the vote's two-two."
Leslie Knope, This was all for nothing.
Ron Swanson, I thought it was very big of you to not bend when Tammy promised you the vote.
Leslie Knope," Well, I thought it was very big of you to help him at all."
Leslie Knope, You didn't have to do that.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," Back to work, to figure out how to destroy you."
Ron Swanson, Same.
Ron Swanson, Goodbye.
Lucy," Dude, thank you so much for this."
Lucy, I really owe you one.
Tom Haverford," No, you don't."
Tom Haverford, You're smart and qualified and we're totally lucky to have you.
Tom Haverford," Okay, let's do this."
Tom Haverford," I still don't know what ""claiming allowances"" means."
Tom Haverford, I always just put six.
Tom Haverford," So far, so good."
Lucy," Dude, you are totally going to jail."
Andy Dwyer, This couldn't have worked out any better.
Andy Dwyer, There was a guy eating lunch in here who didn't finish his spaghetti.
Andy Dwyer," Also, Tom and Lucy are totally gonna fall in love."
Andy Dwyer, Five second rule!

Leslie Knope,"So, gentlemen, you have evidence that the Newport land should be preserved."
Extra,Absolutely.
Extra,"You see, I'm a ninth level octopriest in the Church of the Reasonableists."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, boy."
Extra,The land is sacred in our religion because it's the place where all human souls will be transmuted when Zorp the Lizard God passes through Jupiter's Sphincter.
April Ludgate,Hail Zorp.
Extra,Hail Zorp.
Leslie Knope,I'm looking for anything to strengthen my case that the Newport land should become a park and not a corporate campus.
Leslie Knope,"Religious reasons, animal conservation, historical significance."
Leslie Knope,Anything.
Leslie Knope,"So, hold onto your straws, everybody, because Mama's going grasping."
Manrico Della Rossa,"In 1980, there were more than 600 million Indiana Brown Ants in that forest."
Manrico Della Rossa,"Today, there are only 595 million."
Manrico Della Rossa,"At that rate, they'll all be gone by the year 203060."
Leslie Knope,Two hundred and three thousand and sixty?
Leslie Knope,Two hundred thousand years from now?
Manrico Della Rossa,Yes.
Leslie Knope,That doesn't seem like an immediate crisis.
Herman,I've got a different idea for that land.
Herman,An amusement park with rides and food and sexy cartoon characters.
Herman,I call it Disneyland.
Leslie Knope,How did you get in here?
Herman,Broke a window.
Roscoe,"Hey, guys."
Roscoe,Come on in.
Roscoe,"You guys, I am Roscoe."
Roscoe,I am Vice President of Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.
Roscoe,Feel free in this meeting to break out your vapes and just kick back.
Roscoe,"Now, peep this."
Roscoe,Leslie Knope has been meeting with people to try to sexy up her presentation.
Roscoe,"So, we had this far out brain tornado."
Tom Haverford,Good idea.
Roscoe,"We should get a brity to come kick it with us smalltime and then just be like, ""Hey, chums."""
Roscoe,"""Let's get tight with Gryzz."""
Tom Haverford,We need a celebrity as a minority owner.
Tom Haverford,It will strengthen Gryzzl's bid.
Ron Swanson,Is a celebrity necessary?
Ron Swanson,I prefer quality over flash.
Ron Swanson,That's why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.
Donna Meagle,Celebrities can help with this kind of thing.
Donna Meagle,The Nets wouldn't be in Brooklyn if it weren't for Jay Z.
Donna Meagle,And the sales for ChickfilA went through the roof once Elton John bought them.
Roscoe,Exactly.
Roscoe,Gryzzl is an outsider here in Pawnee.
Roscoe,"So, a local celebrity is going to make everyone feel more at ease with us."
Roscoe,And that's why we called on you home court chillers to frack your brainiums.
Tom Haverford,"Since we're locals, they want us to think of ideas--"
Ron Swanson,I got it from context.
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Ron Swanson,I have no interest in consorting with celebrities.
Ron Swanson,"The only celebrities I recognize are furniture maker Garry Knox Bennett, designer of the notorious and Magnus, the five-by-five bull elk I saw near my cabin two years ago."
Ron Swanson,"Took a shot at the bastard, and he stuck his antlers through the door of my meat shed."
Ron Swanson,"One day, Magnus, I will wear you as a jacket."
Andy Dwyer,Have you thought about this?
Andy Dwyer,You could be an airline pilot.
April Ludgate,I don't like heights.
Andy Dwyer,What about a submarine pilot?
April Ludgate,I don't like depths.
April Ludgate,"I don't like anything, okay?"
April Ludgate,You're not gonna be able to find a career for me.
April Ludgate,"So, just give up."
Andy Dwyer,"No way, babe."
Andy Dwyer,We can do this.
Andy Dwyer,Let's play a game.
Andy Dwyer,Okay?
Andy Dwyer,"You say a word, I say a word, we see if it makes a profession."
April Ludgate,Executive.
Andy Dwyer,Trampoline.
April Ludgate,Computer.
Andy Dwyer,Trampoline.
April Ludgate,Trampoline.
Andy Dwyer,Pass.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Leslie, I need both you and Ron to sign this City Point of Sale document, since the land you're gunning for lies within city limits."
Ben Wyatt,Can we run over to Ron's office and take care of this?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I love it when you talk Point of Sale docs."
Leslie Knope,You know it turns me on.
Leslie Knope,But no.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,There's no way that I will be in the same room with Ron Swanson unless it is during a police lineup when I am pointing him out as the man who betrayed me.
Leslie Knope,"""That's him, officer!"""
Leslie Knope,"""Ronald Swanson."""
Leslie Knope,"""Thank you, Leslie, that's the fifth crime you've solved this month."""
Leslie Knope,"""I'm not supposed to do this, but let me give you a badge and a siren for your car."""
Ben Wyatt,Could you please focus?
Ben Wyatt,It will take two minutes.
Ben Wyatt,"And all signatures need to be notarized, and I really don't want to have to schedule two different notary appointments."
Jerry Gergich,"Not to eavesdrop, but I have a crazy story."
Jerry Gergich,"I recently had a bit of a health scare, just a couple weeks in the hospital."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God."
Andy Dwyer,This story's terrible so far.
Jerry Gergich,"Anyway, I became really motivated once I got out to finally live life to the fullest."
Jerry Gergich,"So, I fulfilled one of my lifelong dreams, and I became a Notary Public."
Jerry Gergich,"So, if I go with you, Ron and Leslie can sign the document separately."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"See, Ben?"
Leslie Knope,It all works out.
Leslie Knope,"I'll sign the documents here, and then you can bring it to Ron and he can sign it there, and then you can tell Ron to rot in hell."
Ben Wyatt,How long are you two going to go on like this?
Ben Wyatt,You're acting like a little kid.
Leslie Knope,"No, I'm not."
Leslie Knope,And infinity plus one year.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, bring in the next person."
Tom Haverford,Perd Hapley.
Tom Haverford,Crazy Ira and the Douche.
Tom Haverford,Tom Haverford?
Tom Haverford,"That's nice, but I don't know if you can really consider me a celebrity."
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,That's your handwriting.
Tom Haverford,"These are all great options, but I think we need to go after Pawnee's biggest fish."
Tom Haverford,Annabel Porter from Bloosh.
Ron Swanson,That horrifying Lifestyle Newsletter filled with vegan recipes and pointless tchotchkes?
Ron Swanson,Forget it.
Ron Swanson,That woman is my nightmare.
Donna Meagle,"Um, she's a big deal, Ron."
Donna Meagle,Bloosh has won the Pulitzer Prize for best top ten listicle two years in a row.
Bill Haggerty,"Hi, Leslie."
Bill Haggerty,Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee Historical Society.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, Bill, I remember you."
Bill Haggerty,"I heard you were looking for information on the Newport land, and I have some very exciting news for you."
Bill Haggerty,It concerns William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,We claim William Henry Harrison as a hero because he was the first governor of the Indiana territories and then President of the United States.
Leslie Knope,"We're also a little ashamed of him because he didn't wear a coat at his inauguration, caught a bad cold and died 32 days later."
Leslie Knope,He's an embarrassing footnote.
Leslie Knope,But he's our embarrassing footnote.
Bill Haggerty,"I've recently self published a biography about Harrison entitled ""Barely a President. William Henry Harrison's Thirty Two Days in the White House."""
Bill Haggerty,I discovered that Harrison had a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land you're trying to acquire.
April Ludgate,"Um, spoilers much?"
April Ludgate,Now I'll never read that book.
Leslie Knope,"If a US President had a house on that land, it could qualify for historic landmark status, and we could really stick it to Ron's team."
Leslie Knope,"Which would be icing on the cake, not the reason why we're doing this."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Show me this incredible lodge.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Andy Dwyer,"That book sounded so boring, I cried a little."
April Ludgate,"Oh, babe, I'm sorry you had to hear that."
April Ludgate,You're safe now.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry to bother you, but I need you to sign this Point of Sale document."
Ben Wyatt,And please sign it in cursive.
Ben Wyatt,It raises a lot of red flags if you don't.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ron Swanson,"So, what's Leslie up to?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I don't think I should discuss that, given that you're in competition."
Ben Wyatt,Need to remain neutral.
Ron Swanson,Fair enough.
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what's Leslie up to?"
Jerry Gergich,She is trying to find a historical reason to earmark the land for preservation.
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on, man."
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you little sneak."
Ron Swanson,"If Leslie is going for a hook, we should, too."
Ron Swanson,Let's get Annabel Bloosh person.
Tom Haverford,Yes.
Tom Haverford,Glad to see you've finally come around after these two minutes of insanity.
Tom Haverford,"Now, will you please consider investing in that toddler cologne I've been bugging you about?"
Tom Haverford,Toddler cologne.
Tom Haverford,"Baby, you smell good."
Bill Haggerty,Here we are.
Leslie Knope,"Here we are, like, ""Here's the place where I buried the map that will show us the way to William Henry Harrison's awesome hunting cabin?"""
Bill Haggerty,No.
Bill Haggerty,This is all that's left.
April Ludgate,This place is awesome.
April Ludgate,"Babe, we should sell our dumb house and buy this one."
Leslie Knope,"You know, I love William Henry Harrison as much, if not slightly more than, the next guy, but this is garbage."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, literally."
Leslie Knope,There's a bag of old hamburgers over there.
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,How old?
Leslie Knope,"We're running out of time, and we need to beat Ron."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to have to use this old pile of bricks."
Leslie Knope,I need to gather everything I can on William Henry Harrison.
Bill Haggerty,Let's head to the Harrison museum over in Vincennes.
Bill Haggerty,I volunteer there part time.
Andy Dwyer,I found an artifact!
Andy Dwyer,Historical artifact!
Andy Dwyer,William Henry Harrison's wig.
Leslie Knope,Andy.
Leslie Knope,Put that down.
April Ludgate,Cool.
Ben Wyatt,You've got to be kidding me.
Jerry Gergich,"No, I'm sorry, Ben, but there's a page missing from the document."
Jerry Gergich,"So, then, the signatures are invalid."
Ben Wyatt,Can't we just say it was there?
Jerry Gergich,You're asking a notary to lie.
Jerry Gergich,"I signed an oath, Ben."
Jerry Gergich,And then a different notary notarized the oath I signed.
April Ludgate,William Henry Harrison is totally ridiculous.
April Ludgate,They can't even fill a small museum with real stuff about his life because he was so lame.
April Ludgate,The If He'd Worn A Coat room explores how great America would have been if Harrison had worn a coat at his inauguration and not died.
April Ludgate,This room is called Other Things That Were Famous For One Month.
April Ludgate,"Oh, and side note, admission to this museum costs 14 dollars."
April Ludgate,"And while you're here, why not visit the Other Famous Harrisons exhibit?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys, this is so great."
Leslie Knope,"During the election campaign of 1840, William Henry Harrison supporters rolled this ten foot tin and paper ball down country lanes all across America."
Leslie Knope,"And they would sing along with a jug band, and it was just so exciting."
Leslie Knope,People would come from miles just to see it.
Andy Dwyer,Why?
Andy Dwyer,Was there something inside the stupid ball?
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Like a giant hamster?
Leslie Knope,"This is what we have to work with, okay?"
Leslie Knope,"We are up against a very flashy Internet company, and we should be aiming for quantity over quality."
Leslie Knope,"So, we're going to throw a bunch of Harrison facts at them and a big pile of bricks and whatever else we can find."
Leslie Knope,"Quantity, people!"
Leslie Knope,Quantity!
Tom Haverford,Wow!
Tom Haverford,This is exactly what I imagined heaven looks like.
Tom Haverford,Right down to the unisex linen tunics.
Tom Haverford,"Annabel, ma cherie."
Annabel Porter,Hi.
Annabel Porter,I'm sorry I'm late for our coven.
Annabel Porter,I was polishing my oyster forks with a cage-free olive oil rub.
Ron Swanson,"Apology accepted, and then I have no reaction to anything else you said."
Donna Meagle,"I can't help but ask, what's in right now?"
Annabel Porter,"Well, this season, I'm intrigued by asymmetrical overalls, angora toothbrushes, and locally sourced Italian flip-flops."
Annabel Porter,"Also, there's a flirty trend in beverages."
Annabel Porter,"So, you've had soy milk and almond milk."
Annabel Porter,"Now, try the hottest new craze, beef milk."
Annabel Porter,It's like almond milk that's been squeezed through tiny holes in living cows.
Ron Swanson,That's [bleep] milk.
Tom Haverford,No.
Annabel Porter,No.
Tom Haverford,Milk costs 3 dollars a gallon.
Tom Haverford,"Annabel's authentic, hand-strained teat-to-table Beef Milk?"
Tom Haverford,That costs 60 dollars a gallon.
Donna Meagle,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,And there's a wait list.
Donna Meagle,This woman knows business.
Annabel Porter,And I would be extremely jazzed to be part of the Gryzzl bid.
Annabel Porter,Shall we discuss it in my yurt?
Annabel Porter,Great.
Ben Wyatt,Ron.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, let's try this again."
Ben Wyatt,All pages accounted for.
Ben Wyatt,Just sign right here.
Ron Swanson,How is Leslie doing with her quest?
Ben Wyatt,"Again, I don't want to talk about her plan with you, nor yours with her."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sure you understand.
Ron Swanson,Absolutely.
Ron Swanson,"Terry, what is Leslie up to?"
Jerry Gergich,Getting ready for a big press conference.
Ben Wyatt,"Terry, come on!"
Ron Swanson,A press conference?
Ron Swanson,"So, she's found something to strengthen her bid."
Ron Swanson,Ms. Porter.
Annabel Porter,Mmm?
Ron Swanson,No need to discuss any further.
Ron Swanson,You will be the face of the Gryzzl bid.
Annabel Porter,Smashing.
Annabel Porter,"Well, this calls for a celebratory dram of aged grappa."
Annabel Porter,"So, I just sign here?"
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,No!
Ben Wyatt,Ah!
Annabel Porter,Great.
Annabel Porter,There you go.
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, that's invalid now."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I know.
April Ludgate,"Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty."
April Ludgate,I just wanted to say that I really like your museum.
April Ludgate,It's weird and sad and unnecessary.
April Ludgate,"Is there, like, a museum curator position I could apply for?"
Bill Haggerty,"Sorry, everyone here is a volunteer."
Bill Haggerty,"Though you do get a yearly stipend of 50,000 Harrison Bucks."
Bill Haggerty,Accepted only at that vending machine.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,That's a bummer.
Andy Dwyer,"But, hey, babe, listen."
Andy Dwyer,Maybe you could start your own museum.
April Ludgate,About what?
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, but I am not like you."
April Ludgate,You love everything.
April Ludgate,"The only things I like are dogs, sleeping late, and weird birthmarks."
April Ludgate,You can't make museums about those.
April Ludgate,This is another dead end.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Guys, let's keep it going."
Leslie Knope,Right?
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab the reading glasses.
Leslie Knope,Somebody grab that walking stick.
Leslie Knope,Grab everything you can.
Leslie Knope,I'm officially dubbing this Operation Quantity.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, thank God you're still here."
Ben Wyatt,I cannot believe the weird notary hell I've been trapped in.
Jerry Gergich,It's been more like heaven for me.
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, what a day."
Leslie Knope,What's Ron up to?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I am not--"
Leslie Knope,"No, you have to tell me because you legally bound yourself to me in marriage, sucker."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."
Ben Wyatt,They got Annabel Porter to be the celebrity face of their group.
Leslie Knope,That little rat.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Two can play this game.
Leslie Knope,"Bill, Operation Quantity needs a face."
Leslie Knope,Does William Henry Harrison have any direct descendants in the area?
Bill Haggerty,One.
Bill Haggerty,A distant nephew named Zach Harrison.
Leslie Knope,This is our guy!
Leslie Knope,American royalty!
Leslie Knope,His veins pulse with the blood of our storied forefathers!
Andy Dwyer,Zach Harrison?
Andy Dwyer,I went to camp with this guy.
Andy Dwyer,No one would ride in the boat with him because he had terrible BO.
Andy Dwyer,"Then, he went with Janine, our counselor, and he fell asleep and got a boner."
Leslie Knope,"Well, he's American royalty."
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,And we need him for the press conference.
Leslie Knope,And we need all of this stuff.
Leslie Knope,"So help me God, I will make a mountain out of this molehill."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, I do--"
Leslie Knope," Quantity, people."
Jerry Gergich,Notary publics can trace our origin all the way back to ancient Rome.
Ben Wyatt,No way.
Jerry Gergich,Calvin Coolidge was a notary.
Jerry Gergich,Mmmhmm.
Jerry Gergich,And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad and so was Calvin Coolidge's paternal grandfather.
Ben Wyatt,Uh-huh.
Jerry Gergich,It's 2.5 pounds of pressure is what you need to get the perfect stamp.
Jerry Gergich,"This monthly-- Well, it's a notary email newsletter."
Jerry Gergich,"And, oh, my gosh."
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Jerry Gergich,"Ben, it's fun."
Jerry Gergich,It's just fun.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, I have been thinking a lot about what you said."
Andy Dwyer,I made a list of everything that I know you like.
Andy Dwyer,"Playing with our dog, staring contests, sex with me, etc."
Andy Dwyer,"And then, I lost the list."
Andy Dwyer,"So, I had to make a new list."
Andy Dwyer,"I didn't have any paper, so I wrote it on my leg."
Andy Dwyer,And that's when my leg fell asleep.
April Ludgate,"Okay, could you just skip ahead a little?"
Andy Dwyer,What do all the things on that list have in common?
Andy Dwyer,They're one-on-one.
Andy Dwyer,You like dealing with people or dogs one-on-one.
Andy Dwyer,"See, we don't make a list of the things that you love."
Andy Dwyer,We make a list of the reasons why you love them.
Andy Dwyer,And then we find something that fits that list.
April Ludgate,You're the best husband ever.
Zach Harrison,"Hi, Zach Harrison."
Zach Harrison,You wanted to meet with me about a press conference?
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello, Zach."
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I am Leslie."
Leslie Knope,It is an honor to have you here.
Leslie Knope,You are Indiana's last living link to this great man.
Zach Harrison,"Look, I really don't think you should make a big deal out of this."
Zach Harrison,I just happen to be a descendant of a guy.
Zach Harrison,"You could be the descendant of George Washington, I wouldn't know."
Leslie Knope,Do you?
Zach Harrison,"No, that was just a hypothetical--"
Leslie Knope,Could that be possible?
Leslie Knope,"Because, you know, I've always thought that we shared very similar jawlines."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,That's something to chew on.
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, okay, doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope,I need this to be very impressive.
Leslie Knope,"So, head on in there and be presidentially descended."
Leslie Knope,Just go in there.
Leslie Knope,Okay?
Leslie Knope,"Just walk, walk, walk there."
Leslie Knope,Quiet now.
Leslie Knope,Walk in.
Andy Dwyer,Zach!
Andy Dwyer,Camp Wamapoke.
Andy Dwyer,You got a boner.
Andy Dwyer,We'll catch up.
Andy Dwyer,What a dick.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,No!
Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing here?"
Ron Swanson,"Setting up for our press conference, which will take place immediately after yours."
Leslie Knope,Are you crazy?
Leslie Knope,You can't do that.
April Ludgate,Do you want me to bite him?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Ignore them.
Leslie Knope,We start in 10 minutes.
Donna Meagle,"Swanson, you didn't say anything about ambushing Leslie's press conference."
Ron Swanson,I didn't think it was relevant.
Tom Haverford,"Come on, man."
Tom Haverford,This isn't cool.
Ron Swanson,This is a competition.
Ron Swanson,We need to win it.
Ron Swanson,Please do your jobs.
Leslie Knope,Good evening.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee is a place of culture, history, and heritage."
Leslie Knope,And the National Parks Service is proud to say that we've discovered a new chapter in the life of local hero and President William Henry Harrison.
Leslie Knope,A heretofore unknown hunting lodge was recently discovered smack dab in the middle of the Newport land.
Leslie Knope,What great historical moments took place within these hallowed halls?
Leslie Knope,Did Harrison plan his presidential campaign while sitting around the hearth which used to be there.
Leslie Knope,"Did he write letters to Thomas Jefferson on his rolltop desk, which, you know, I don't know, might have existed."
Leslie Knope,The point is William Henry Harrison would have wanted this land preserved as a national park.
Leslie Knope,Don't believe me?
Leslie Knope,Let's ask him.
Leslie Knope," In the form of his direct descendant, Zachary."
Zach Harrison," Hi, I'm Zach."
Zach Harrison, Harrison.
Leslie Knope, Amazing.
Zach Harrison," Zachary, what is it like being a descendant of William Henry Harrison?"
Zach Harrison,Uh... Harrison's a pretty common last name.
Leslie Knope," Okay, sit."
Leslie Knope," Now, travel back in time with me to 1840, when William Henry Harrison, ""Old Tippecanoe,"" runs for President."
Leslie Knope," And his campaign rolls this giant tin and paper ball from town to town, while Americans everywhere sing along."
Leslie Knope," Hit it, gang!"
Extras,"What has caused this great commotion, motion, motion Our country through It is the ball a-rolling on"
Leslie Knope,They're talking about this ball.
Extras," For Tippecanoe and Tyler, too Tippecanoe and Tyler, too And with him, we'll beat Little Van"
Leslie Knope,Martin Van Buren.
Leslie Knope, That's who.
Extras, Van is a used up man And with them we'll beat Little Van
Tom Haverford,"Wow, that was cool, said some boring idiot from 200 years ago."
Tom Haverford, Who cares about some dumb grandpa and his tin ball? That's the past.
Tom Haverford, Gryzzl is the future.
Tom Haverford, The Newport land will become the Midwest headquarters of America's most dynamic technology company.
Donna Meagle," Here to introduce our vision is Annabel Porter from Bloosh, and the sexy ladies known in Pawnee as the Somebody's Daughter dancers."
Annabel Porter, Fresh.
Annabel Porter, Innovative.
Annabel Porter, Placemaking.
Annabel Porter, Disposable duvets.
Annabel Porter, Growth hacking.
Annabel Porter, Super Moon.
Annabel Porter, Gryzzl.
Annabel Porter," Now, come with me, as we binge-watch the future."
Leslie Knope, That was sickening.
Leslie Knope," All flash, and no substance."
Ron Swanson, It was exactly as substantive as your presentation.
Leslie Knope," No, it was not! We had way more quantity than you."
Ben Wyatt, Please.
Ben Wyatt, Please.
Ben Wyatt," For the love of all that is holy, both of you, please, sign this form."
Ben Wyatt, Not that it matters.
Ben Wyatt, I'm definitely going to wake up tomorrow morning with the same forms for you to sign.
Ben Wyatt, Because I've died somehow and now I'm a ghost living in purgatory until I complete my unfinished business.
Leslie Knope, I'm not signing anything he's signing.
Ben Wyatt, Did you just hear what I said?
Ben Wyatt,"No, of course you didn't."
Ben Wyatt, Because I'm a ghost.
Leslie Knope, You know what? I can't stand you.
Leslie Knope, I can't stand your stupid mustache and your stupid shirt and your stupid name.
Leslie Knope, Ron.
Leslie Knope, Ron.
Leslie Knope, That's not even a word.
Ron Swanson," Well, I have had just about enough of your stubborn behavior."
Ron Swanson," Ever since the Morningstar incident, you have been completely unreasonable."
Leslie Knope, You are the unreasonable one!
Leslie Knope,You've been unreasonable way before Morningstar!
Leslie Knope,"You're the most unreasonable, stubborn person I have ever met, and I'm never gonna change my mind on that, no matter what anybody says!"
Ron Swanson,You're not that good at scrapbooking.
Leslie Knope, What?
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich, Would you just sign right here? And I will need your thumbprints.
Tom Haverford," Man, those two really hate each other."
Tom Haverford," That feud is, like, Biggie Tupac level."
Tom Haverford, Maybe even Morgan Freeman Shailene Woodley level.
Donna Meagle, Naw.
Donna Meagle," It's bad, but it's not that bad."
Ben Wyatt, This is like when the triplets fight except I can't just give Leslie and Ron stuffed animals to make them calm down.
Ben Wyatt," Actually, that might work."
Ben Wyatt, Have we tried that?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, they've always butted heads, but I really I don't think they hate each other."
Jerry Gergich, I just think they're very different people and they've just drifted apart once they stopped working in the same office.
Ben Wyatt, You okay?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Well, I ordered 60 veggie pizzas to Ron's office."
Leslie Knope," So, that calmed me down a little."
Ben Wyatt, I know you're furious at him.
Ben Wyatt," But please, come to a neutral site and sit with Ron for 30 seconds so I can get this dumb document signed."
Leslie Knope,Ugh.
Ben Wyatt,"I'll let you rename the triplets Ruth, Bader, and Ginsburg."
Leslie Knope," Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope, But I get to sign first.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope," All right, let's just get this over with."
Ben Wyatt, Let me get that for you.
Ben Wyatt, Got them!
Leslie Knope,What? What's going on? What's going on?
Ron Swanson,Let us out immediately.
Ben Wyatt, No.
Ben Wyatt, You guys are being ridiculous.
Ben Wyatt," This has gone too far, and you are not leaving this office until you've made peace."
Leslie Knope, No!   
Ron Swanson,No!

Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, Ron."
Ben Wyatt,Doors are locked.
Ben Wyatt,We've taken your keycards and your phones and the automatic timer won't go off until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m.
Ben Wyatt,You're trapped in there.
Tom Haverford,We told security not to disturb you under any circumstances.
Tom Haverford,And the phones and Internet?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, they've been disconnected."
April Ludgate,And I left a rusty hacksaw on the table.
April Ludgate,"So, the first person who hacks their face off gets released."
Andy Dwyer,That's not-- What?
Andy Dwyer,Is that true?
Leslie Knope,"Guys, this is insane, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let us out.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, babe, Game of Thrones is on tonight!"
Leslie Knope,It's the series finale.
Leslie Knope,Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, God, that show has really gone off the rails."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, it makes sense if you've read the books."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, our baby monitor is on the table."
Ben Wyatt,"If you guys can talk this out and settle your differences like grownups, turn it on and I will come to get you from my office."
Ben Wyatt,"Otherwise, we will see you at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning."
Ron Swanson,I am going to break out of here.
Ron Swanson,"Then, I am going to snap you in half."
Donna Meagle,Hey!
Donna Meagle,"This is not his fault, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,Be a man and get your house in order.
Donna Meagle,"You, too, Knope."
Jerry Gergich,"Good luck, you guys."
Jerry Gergich,I really hope you can work out your differences.
Ron Swanson,Terry.
Ron Swanson,Look at me.
Ron Swanson,Is this what you want to do?
Ron Swanson,"Think very carefully, son."
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"That's right, buddy."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,"For once in your life, do something right."
April Ludgate,"Stop it, Terry!"
April Ludgate,Both of you.
April Ludgate,Come on.
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, Terry!"
Leslie Knope,"Damn it, Terry!"
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Think.
Ron Swanson,There must be a way out of here.
Leslie Knope,I don't think there is.
Leslie Knope,They installed these magnetic locks two years ago.
Leslie Knope,There's no way around them.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, there is."
Ron Swanson,I'll simply punch my fist through a window.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, there's security wire in there."
Leslie Knope,You'll slice your arm open.
Ron Swanson,I would rather bleed out than sit here and talk about my feelings for 10 hours.
Leslie Knope,There is another way.
Leslie Knope,"We'll just wait a few minutes, turn on this monitor, and then we'll tell Ben that we talked it out and made up."
Leslie Knope,"I'll just tell them that I apologized for, whatever, heroically caring too much."
Leslie Knope,"And you admitted that you were a stubborn butthead, and everything's fine now."
Ron Swanson,Why do I have to be stubborn?
Ron Swanson,Why can't the problem have been that I was reasonable and you were at fault?
Leslie Knope,Because we want them to believe us and not laugh really hard at a ridiculous science fiction scenario.
Ron Swanson,We are not saying I was the problem.
Ron Swanson,"If we're going to lie to them, I will not let you lie to them."
Leslie Knope,"Fine, I'll tell them that, for the past three years, you've been a perfect gentleman and scholar, and I am an insane weirdo who, despite being the only reason we even had a friendship to begin with, decided to ruin it, out of the blue, for no good reason."
Ron Swanson,That sounds good.
Ron Swanson,Let's go with that.
Leslie Knope,Hut!
Ron Swanson,What are you doing?
Leslie Knope,I destroyed the monitor!
Ron Swanson,What if we have an emergency and have to get out of here?
Leslie Knope,I did not consider that possibility!
Leslie Knope,Everything's different.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the furniture, the pictures Craig changed everything."
Ron Swanson,Did he?
Ron Swanson,I tried not to notice anything when I worked here.
Ron Swanson,"Or talk to anyone, or learn anyone's name."
Ron Swanson,"You of all people should know that, Lauren."
Leslie Knope,"Look, we are going to be here for 10 hours."
Leslie Knope,"We can either talk about our issues and work through our problems, or we can just sit here doing nothing."
Ron Swanson,"I choose ""sit here."""
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron, why don't we just--"
Ron Swanson,Sit here.
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Sit here.
Leslie Knope,I bet I can make you talk.
Ron Swanson,"I'll take that bet at any odds, for any amount of money, over any length of time stretching from now into infinity."
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk.
Leslie Knope,Talk to me!
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,Drip.
Leslie Knope,"One word, and this is over."
Leslie Knope,"I think wood is stupid, and so does everybody else."
Leslie Knope,"You guys, Ron loves plastic."
Leslie Knope,"Last chance, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want to talk?
Leslie Knope,Huh?
Leslie Knope,Ah-hah!
Leslie Knope,Jackpot.
Leslie Knope,"You know what this is, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,"This is a mix I made for the summer Parks barbecue, 2007."
Leslie Knope,I asked everyone in the Parks Department to choose one song.
Leslie Knope,You chose Buddy by Willie Nelson.
Leslie Knope,A fact I remember because my mind is a steel trap of friendship nuggets.
Leslie Knope,But I am not going to play your choice.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,That's right.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna sing along.
Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna maintain eye contact the whole time.
Leslie Knope,And guess what?
Leslie Knope,I don't know the words.
Leslie Knope,"Harry Truman was a guy America, Red China All the countries, other people Everyone is fun Joe Mantegna, lan McKellen I have to buy a new toaster This is awesome You're so stupid Jumping up and down Whoo!"
Leslie Knope,I got it on repeat.
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Do you want to hear it again, or do you want to talk?"
Leslie Knope,No?
Leslie Knope,"Okay, next verse."
Leslie Knope,Freddy Krueger bought some pants Oprah has a turtle farm Peter Piper peepee poopy Daddy ate a squirrel
Ron Swanson,Stop this!
Ron Swanson,I will speak with you for three minutes.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Ron Swanson,"So, what would you like to talk about?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,We were friends for 10 years.
Ron Swanson,We were work proximity associates.
Leslie Knope,We were friends.
Leslie Knope,And now we're not.
Leslie Knope,"And once again, it is up to me to save our friendship."
Leslie Knope,And I will do so using the most powerful tool known to man.
Leslie Knope,A well organized chart.
Leslie Knope,"Three years ago, I accept a job at National Parks."
Leslie Knope,"You and I see each other less, admittedly, due to my busy schedule and your utter lack of interest in maintaining adult friendships."
Ron Swanson,Work proximity associateships.
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, April comes to work for me."
Leslie Knope,We throw her a party.
Leslie Knope,"At her request, the party's theme is ""Zombie Teenage Biker Gang Pizza Jamboree."""
Ron Swanson,I remember.
Ron Swanson,You made me wear a leather jacket.
Leslie Knope,That is the last time you and I see each other for more than five minutes.
Leslie Knope,"Three months later, you come and visit me at my office on the third floor for the very first time."
Leslie Knope,"One week later, I return from a trip, and I find out you have quit the Parks Department and you have started your own building company without even bothering to tell me."
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, well,"" I think to myself, ""You know, it was only a matter of time."""
Leslie Knope,"And then, two months after that, Morningstar, the final twist of the knife."
Ron Swanson,"Oh, for God's sake."
Leslie Knope,"I hear about Morningstar, and I calmly saunter down to your office and attempt to have a rational discussion with you about it."
Leslie Knope,"What the hell, Ron?"
Leslie Knope,You're building your stupid building on the block next to Pawnee Commons?
Leslie Knope,The park that I built from scratch out of a pit?
Leslie Knope,"This building is gonna ruin the views, you jerk."
Leslie Knope,And you're gonna tear all the houses down?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Ann lived there, Ron."
Leslie Knope,That's Ann's old house.
Leslie Knope,That's my best friend's old house.
Leslie Knope,That was the house where I put on my wedding dress the night I got married.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where April and Andy met for the first time.
Leslie Knope,That is the house where Ann gave me my first ever smoky eye look.
Ron Swanson,She hasn't lived there for five years.
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,This building is a monstrosity.
Leslie Knope,And what's it called?
Leslie Knope,"""Morningstar?"""
Leslie Knope,"""Oh, dear."""
Leslie Knope,"""We live at the Morningstar."""
Leslie Knope,"""That's so posh and hibbley fibbley gibbley."""
Ron Swanson,The world needs apartment buildings.
Ron Swanson,The park you built is nice and people want to live next to it.
Leslie Knope,That's not the point.
Leslie Knope,"You knew that I would be furious, and you didn't have the guts to tell me yourself."
Leslie Knope,"Enjoy your new job, Judas."
Leslie Knope,You tear down Ann's house.
Leslie Knope,"You spend the next two years cutting down trees and fighting zoning laws that I helped pass, basically spitting on everything we did together at Parks."
Ron Swanson,That's not the whole story.
Leslie Knope,What does that mean?
Ron Swanson,It means what it means.
Ron Swanson,That is not the whole story of why I left.
Ron Swanson,"Sorry, your time is up."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Why then?
Leslie Knope,What was the reason?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, you made a key?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, please, don't--"
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just talk to me."
Leslie Knope,"Ron, come on!"
Ron Swanson,See you tomorrow morning.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Progress.
Leslie Knope,Is it that I sent you a birthday card through the US mail so the post office knew your address?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Go away.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, is it because I had Food and Stuff temporarily shut down due to a health code violation?"
Ron Swanson,That was you?
Leslie Knope,They had fresh produce out right next to the roach spray.
Ron Swanson,The name of the store is Food and Stuff.
Ron Swanson,"They sell food, and they sell stuff."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't like it, go to that new place, Complete Food."
Leslie Knope,It's called Whole Foods.
Leslie Knope,And is that really the reason?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,How many more questions are you going to ask me?
Leslie Knope,As many as I need to to solve this mystery and get us engaged in a deep and stimulating conversation about our friendship.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what are you doing?"
Ron Swanson,I know I saw it.
Ron Swanson,Ah-hah!
Ron Swanson,Detonator.
Ron Swanson,The partially defused Claymore mine you gave me 10 years ago.
Ron Swanson,I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door so I can get out of here.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, just wait a second."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,"I'm being held as a prisoner against my will, and I have the right, as a citizen of the United States, to blow a hole in that [bleep] door and walk out as a free man."
Ron Swanson,It's in the Constitution.
Leslie Knope,There's no cursing in the Constitution.
Leslie Knope,"Look, before you do that…"
Ron Swanson,Too late.
Ron Swanson,Here we go.
Ron Swanson,Fire in the hole!
Leslie Knope,Woohoo!
Leslie Knope,I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.
Ron Swanson,You told me this was a genuine partially defused Claymore mine.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it was."
Leslie Knope,"I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such."
Ron Swanson,You mean to tell me I have had a toy on my desk for 10 years?
Leslie Knope,You mean to tell me you've thought you had an actual land mine on your desk?
Leslie Knope,"Congratulations, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You've been doing an explosive job!
Leslie Knope,"Come on, Ron."
Leslie Knope,It's funny stuff.
Leslie Knope,Who gets angry at balloons?
Leslie Knope,Good talk.
Ron Swanson,What's all this?
Leslie Knope,"I'm just reading back through some of our old projects, trying to figure out what happened that made you quit."
Ron Swanson,"Good God, woman."
Leslie Knope,This is a code.
Leslie Knope,I am going to break it.
Leslie Knope,And this is my best shot.
Ron Swanson,Is that nuclear waste?
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,This is my job application from when you hired me.
Ron Swanson,How did you get that?
Leslie Knope,Freedom of Information Act request.
Leslie Knope,But here's the thing.
Leslie Knope,I've never read it.
Leslie Knope,This application contains your very first impressions of me.
Leslie Knope,"It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,The beginning of the whole shebang.
Leslie Knope,This is all you wrote?
Leslie Knope,Three lousy lines?
Ron Swanson,Why would anyone need more than three lines?
Ron Swanson,"I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique."
Ron Swanson,I forgot what I wrote.
Ron Swanson,Can I hear it?
Leslie Knope,Why don't you read it yourself?
Ron Swanson,"""Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky."""
Ron Swanson,"So far, so accurate."
Ron Swanson,"""If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other."""
Leslie Knope,You forgot the last sentence.
Ron Swanson,"No, I didn't."
Ron Swanson,I remember that part.
Ron Swanson,"It says, ""Hire her."""
Ron Swanson,Did you hear that?
Leslie Knope,It's a person.
Leslie Knope,It's another person!
Ron Swanson,Hello!
Ron Swanson,Hello!
Ron Swanson,Janitor!
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,"Hey, we're trapped in here!"
Ron Swanson,Hey!
Ron Swanson,"Please, Mr. Janitor."
Ron Swanson,"If you just look over here for two seconds, I'll do anything."
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Ron Swanson,I'll watch a foreign film.
Ron Swanson,I'll talk to a man with a ponytail.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"He's gone, Ron."
Leslie Knope,He's gone.
Leslie Knope,Why did you give me the job?
Leslie Knope,And that's what I don't get.
Leslie Knope,We should've never worked together.
Leslie Knope,Why did you hire me?
Ron Swanson,Because of your interview.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, that doesn't make any sense."
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I remember that interview."
Leslie Knope,You were wearing that exact outfit.
Leslie Knope,"And you said to me, ""Ms. Knope, I have one question for you."""
Leslie Knope,"""What do you believe the role of government is in America?"""
Ron Swanson,You blathered on for 10 minutes about social safety nets and honest governance and improving lives.
Ron Swanson,Basic nonsense.
Leslie Knope,"Then you said, ""Everything that just came out of your mouth is basic nonsense."""
Leslie Knope,"""Good day."""
Leslie Knope,And that was it.
Ron Swanson,"No, that was not it."
Ron Swanson,"After I said you were full of it, you got very angry and scrunched up your face and said, ""Excuse me, sir, but I disagree."""
Ron Swanson,Did you let me have it.
Ron Swanson,"That was one of your top 10 tirades, I'd say."
Ron Swanson,You were pounding your fist and shaking.
Ron Swanson,You called me a heartless thug.
Leslie Knope,I most certainly did not.
Ron Swanson,"You were tough and honest, and you stood up for what you believed in, even though it might've killed your chance to get the job."
Ron Swanson,I would rather work with a person like that than with a milquetoast yes-man.
Ron Swanson,Should be one more thing in that file.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, it's the thank you note I wrote to you after the interview."
Leslie Knope,You kept it.
Leslie Knope,"""Dear Mr. Swanson, I'm sorry for raising my voice in the interview, and I'm sorry I called you a heartless thug."""
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well, okay."
Leslie Knope,There you go.
Leslie Knope,"""If it matters, I promise I would never ""raise my voice at you if we worked together."""
Ron Swanson,Liar.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I was being really optimistic."
Leslie Knope,"""Please enjoy these homemade brownies as a gesture of goodwill."""
Leslie Knope,"""Leslie Knope."""
Ron Swanson,That was the real reason I hired you.
Ron Swanson,Those brownies were damn good.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, look how far we've come."
Leslie Knope,We're doing so great.
Leslie Knope,"Let's just bring it home, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Let's just talk about our issues.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, don't push it."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope,"If I guess and guess right, you have to tell me."
Leslie Knope,Ready?
Leslie Knope,"Two years ago, you found out you were a quarter French and you had a nervous breakdown."
Ron Swanson,"Okay, playtime is over."
Ron Swanson,I'm getting out of here once and for all.
Leslie Knope,"No, Ron!"
Leslie Knope,"God, no!"
Leslie Knope,That alarm is just for sprinklers.
Leslie Knope,April kept pulling it.
Leslie Knope,So the fire department disconnected it.
Ron Swanson,I see.
Leslie Knope,Ron?
Leslie Knope,I found some towels.
Leslie Knope,You okay?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ron Swanson,"Apparently, Craig is studying yoga."
Ron Swanson,These are the only dry clothes I could find.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you look great."
Ron Swanson,I feel extremely angry.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Stop whining, you big baby."
Leslie Knope,I've seen you with your eyebrows blown off.
Leslie Knope,I've seen you without a mustache.
Leslie Knope,I've seen it all.
Leslie Knope,"There's nowhere to run, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You have tried every possible means of escape.
Leslie Knope,There's nothing to do but talk.
Leslie Knope,What happened to these workplace proximity associates?
Leslie Knope,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,Spill it.
Ron Swanson,You left.
Ron Swanson,"Then a month later, you took Terry with you."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum, and he's the best there is."
Ron Swanson,Amen.
Ron Swanson,Then you took April.
Ron Swanson,"I didn't want her to go, as she had become one of my closest workplace acquaintances."
Ron Swanson,But your offer was too good to pass up.
Ron Swanson,So I didn't try to stop her.
Ron Swanson,Then Tom left to run his business.
Ron Swanson,Donna left to run hers.
Ron Swanson,"One day, I looked up."
Ron Swanson, Just didn't recognize anyone.
Ron Swanson, So I made a decision.
Ron Swanson, An unthinkable decision.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope," Well, my, my, my."
Leslie Knope, Do my eyes deceive me? Is that Ron Swanson?
Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie."
Ron Swanson," Hello, April."
Ron Swanson, Larry.
Jerry Gergich," Uh, It's Terry now."
Ron Swanson, Okay.
Ron Swanson, As luck would have it--
Leslie Knope, One second.
Leslie Knope," Did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the Northeast that we need to put pressure on them, or else we're gonna be waiting forever, and I'm tired of waiting on them, okay? Okay."
Leslie Knope," Sorry, this is a crazy day."
Leslie Knope," So what's up with you, you big lug?"
Ron Swanson,Nothing important.
Ron Swanson, Just thought you might want to have lunch.
Ron Swanson, Tomorrow?
Leslie Knope,I would love to.
Leslie Knope, It's been too long.
Leslie Knope," JJ's Diner, 12:30?"
Ron Swanson,Excellent.
Ron Swanson, See you then.
April Ludgate, Okay.
April Ludgate," So Randy says the House is voting tomorrow, and they need us in Washington to prep."
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God, really?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
Leslie Knope," Okay, get us the first flight out of here and grab the Missouri files."
Leslie Knope, Meet me at my car.
Leslie Knope," Hey, babe."
Leslie Knope, I got to go to Washington.
Leslie Knope, Can you pick up the kids?
Leslie Knope,"Oh... Oh, no."
Leslie Knope," Ron, I stood you up for lunch."
Ron Swanson," You did, yes."
Ron Swanson," I waited for a while, but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened."
Ron Swanson, Your life seemed pretty hectic.
Leslie Knope, Is that the rest of the story? That I stood you up?
Leslie Knope,You were going to ask me something.
Leslie Knope, That's why you wanted to have lunch.
Leslie Knope," Ron, you were going--"
Ron Swanson,I was gonna ask you for a job.
Ron Swanson, In the federal government.
Ron Swanson, Just saying it out loud feels dirty.
Leslie Knope," You missed your friends, and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again."
Leslie Knope, I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.
Leslie Knope," God, why didn't I see that?"
Leslie Knope,"Ron, I am so sorry."
Leslie Knope, I should've been a better friend to you.
Ron Swanson," Honestly, Leslie, it's fine."
Ron Swanson, It was a punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written.
Ron Swanson, My time in government work was over.
Ron Swanson," Sure, I loved shutting things down and bleeding the rotting beast from the inside."
Leslie Knope, Your metaphors are so beautiful.
Ron Swanson," But it was time for me to leave, and I didn't feel like explaining why to you or anyone."
Ron Swanson," Everything that happened after, the fight we had, not giving you a heads-up when my company took on the Morningstar development and bulldozed the nurse's old house, I do regret that."
Ron Swanson, I had a good run here.
Ron Swanson," But after you and Tom and Donna and April and Terry left, when I looked around this office, nothing was the same."
Leslie Knope," Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that."
Leslie Knope, England's got a new queen Everybody's really mean We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning
Ben Wyatt,"Well, this is different from what I expected to find."
Leslie Knope," Morning, guys."
Andy Dwyer," Good morning, Leslie."
Craig Middlebrooks," What did you do to the office? Ron, you're wearing my yoga clothes."
Craig Middlebrooks, You're gonna stretch out the elastic.
Leslie Knope, We're sorry.
Leslie Knope, Fire and money and people
April Ludgate,Hey.
April Ludgate, I moved our meetings to tomorrow because you are drunk and hungover simultaneously at 2:00 in the afternoon.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, good call."
April Ludgate," Also, you have a visitor."
Leslie Knope," No, whoever it is, I have zero interest in--"
Ron Swanson,Hello.
Leslie Knope," Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron."
Ron Swanson," We just spent 12 hours together, woman."
Leslie Knope, Don't care.
Leslie Knope, I have three years' worth of hugs to force upon you against your will.
Ron Swanson, I have a small object for you.
Ron Swanson," Call it an official peace offering, I suppose."
Leslie Knope," Wow, this is very sweet."
Leslie Knope, But you do realize I gave you this picture six hours ago.
Ron Swanson, The frame is the gift.
Ron Swanson," When my company took on the Morningstar development, and I realized it meant bulldozing Ann's old house, I salvaged her front door."
Ron Swanson, Then I stripped off all the terrible paint and lacquer-- People really don't know how to finish wood properly.
Ron Swanson, And I made it into this frame for you in the event that you and I ever…
Leslie Knope,Ron.
Leslie Knope," You big, fat, giant sap."
Ron Swanson, That seems unnecessary.
Leslie Knope, I love it.
Leslie Knope, But I feel bad.
Leslie Knope, I don't have anything for you.
Leslie Knope," For the first time in my life, I am present-less."
Ron Swanson, How about you buy me a meal? You hungry?
Leslie Knope,I'm starving.
Leslie Knope," April, Ron and I are going to JJ's to eat too much breakfast food."
Ron Swanson, Why does anybody in the world ever eat anything but breakfast food?
Leslie Knope,"People are idiots, Ron."

Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Leslie Knope,It's impossible.
Leslie Knope,It's not gonna work in a million years.
Leslie Knope,It's pointless.
Leslie Knope,I give up.
Ben Wyatt,"Good attitude, honey."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know, what do you want from me?"
Leslie Knope,I'm trying to get a group of people to give me their land rather than sell it to Gryzzl for 90 million dollars.
Leslie Knope,"Right now, my basic argument is, ""Please give us the land."""
Leslie Knope,"""It would be so nice."""
Leslie Knope,Gryzzl has billions of dollars.
Leslie Knope,There's no way I beat them.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,I've seen you beat tougher odds than this.
Ben Wyatt,They're just a company.
Ben Wyatt,They're not that powerful.
Leslie Knope,Whoa!
Leslie Knope,"""Open your door?"""
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,"Ben, we're about to die!"
Ben Wyatt,Good lord.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my, The robots have come for us."
Leslie Knope,I made fun of you when you said it would happen but your novel has come true.
Mike Bean,"Hey, Leslie Knope."
Mike Bean,"Please enjoy this free gift, courtesy of Gryzzl."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, they also have a squadron of flying robots giving presents to everyone."
Mike Bean,Later!
Leslie Knope,We're screwed.
Andy Dwyer,Mmm…
Tom Haverford,"New dish we're working on, tell me what you think."
Tom Haverford,"It's a red and white heirloom red bean pasta, with an imported Tuscan walnut herb sauce infused with shaved heritage Pecorino Romano."
Tom Haverford,"What, you're done?"
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Andy Dwyer,Really good.
Andy Dwyer,Why are you doing new dishes?
Tom Haverford,"Lucy is visiting her boyfriend, Conrad, in Chicago."
Tom Haverford,So I'm just trying to distract myself with work so I don't think about the marathon bone sex they're probably having.
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know what, dude, you gotta take your mind off them."
Andy Dwyer,Check this out.
Andy Dwyer,It's a contract.
Andy Dwyer,"It came from the station manager where I do my show, Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,"He wants me to sign it, but it says that they'll own the character Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,"And I want to own the character Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, this says they only pay you 100 bucks a week?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, but all I really do is goof around all day, write, produce and direct a TV show."
Andy Dwyer,"Plus, I act in it, I do sets, props, wardrobe."
Andy Dwyer,At the end I drive everybody home.
Andy Dwyer,"So, I mean, 100 bucks a week, that's pretty fair."
Tom Haverford,This is perfect.
Tom Haverford,I'll be your agent.
Tom Haverford,I'll put all my energy into renegotiating your contract.
Tom Haverford,I won't even think about Lucy and Conrad and his stupid crunches that he probably does.
Tom Haverford,I should probably do some crunches.
Tom Haverford,Let's go.
Tom Haverford,"Andy, my tumtum!"
Donna Meagle,"Knope, I need to talk to you."
Leslie Knope,What's up?
Donna Meagle,"I know I technically work for Gryzzl, but these fools have crossed a line."
Donna Meagle,Have you gotten one of these Gryzzl boxes?
Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, but I haven't opened it yet."
Leslie Knope,Planning on sending it back after I wrote a sternly worded letter about how I cannot be bought with free gifts.
Donna Meagle,These are my free gifts.
Donna Meagle,Two honey bears and a canister of sugar plums.
Donna Meagle,Honeybear and Sugar Plum are the special names Joe and I call each other.
Leslie Knope,Aww!
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, we're adorable, but this is creepy."
Donna Meagle,Because we only call each other these things on the phone or in texts.
Donna Meagle,How do they even know?
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, open that box they sent you."
Leslie Knope,Ooh!
Leslie Knope,"Joe Biden's book, Biden the Rails, 1,001 Poems Inspired by My Travels through Amtrak's Northeast Corridor."
Ben Wyatt,A thousand?
Leslie Knope,A poster of the Supreme Court Justices sipping the Friends milkshake!
Leslie Knope,This stuff is perfect for me.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, exactly."
Ben Wyatt,They must be datamining.
Ben Wyatt,Searching our texts and emails and gathering profiles on all of us.
Ben Wyatt,"This is a huge invasion of privacy, not to mention illegal."
Ben Wyatt,"When they installed their free WiFi in town, I made sure that there was language preventing this."
Donna Meagle,I never would have agreed to work with them if I had known they were gonna be snoopin' in my biz.
Donna Meagle,Gryzzl is going down.
Donna Meagle,"You wanna put me on blast, I'm gonna put you on front street."
Leslie Knope,I don't understand what that means but I think I get the context and I love it!
Craig Middlebrooks,"April, the new Parks interns start today, and I was wondering if you would deliver a little welcome speech."
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,Go away.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Watermelon martinis, exposed brick, Keri Russell's hair."
April Ludgate,Why did you just say those weird things?
Craig Middlebrooks,"On the advice of my therapist, Dr. Richard Nygard, whenever I feel like yelling, I just take a deep breath and say three great things about being alive."
April Ludgate,Gross.
Craig Middlebrooks,Please talk to my interns.
April Ludgate,Fine.
April Ludgate,Whatever.
April Ludgate,I'll do it.
April Ludgate,"I started here when I was 20, and now I'm old and gross and directionless."
April Ludgate,"Those kids are me 10 years ago, and this internship is the videotape from The Ring."
April Ludgate,"It's too late for me, I've seen too much, but maybe I can save them."
April Ludgate,You're all gonna die in here!
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,We are here today to discuss Gryzzl and whether or not they are invading our privacy.
Extra,They sent my husband three boxes of genital cream to his office.
Extra,"My husband's splotchy genitals are no one's business except for his, mine, and his many genital doctors."
Pearl,They sent me a bunch of toy pigs dressed like movie stars.
Pearl,That's my private hobby.
Pearl,No one knows I collect toy pigs dressed like movie stars.
Pearl,Except now all of you people.
Ben Wyatt,Which one is that?
Pearl,This is actually Hamuel L. Jackson from the movie Pork Fiction.
Pearl,"It's extremely rare, and I am keeping it."
Pearl,"But still, they have no right to give me something I will treasure the rest of my life."
Extra,I opened my box in front of all my friends and it was a bunch of Virginia Woolf novels.
Extra,Now Miley and Haley know I like to read!
Extra,What if they tell Evan?
Chance Frenlm,"I like their phones, but they've gone too far, sending this stuff to our houses."
Chance Frenlm,Gryzzl has no right to search our private data.
Leslie Knope,"So, wait."
Leslie Knope,You guys are not against us on this?
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this.
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!
Chance Frenlm,We're not against you on this!
Leslie Knope,"Finally, after months of searching for a way to defeat Gryzzl, we have found its Achilles' heel."
Leslie Knope,The town is behind us.
Leslie Knope,Donna is on our side.
Leslie Knope,And the next domino to fall?
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, this is Tom Selloink, but, you know, close enough."
Pearl,"Actually, I'm gonna need that back."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes, of course."
Leslie Knope,February 2016.
Leslie Knope,I think you're gonna really enjoy this month's photo album.
Leslie Knope,"It includes such hits as first trip to the dentist, Sonia tries pizza, and water park vomit chain reaction."
Ben Wyatt,Why would you take pictures of that?
Leslie Knope,Why would you not?
Ron Swanson,"As you requested, here is a picture of my son, at a recent moment in his life."
Leslie Knope,So cute-- What are you doing?
Ron Swanson,Protecting my son's privacy.
Ron Swanson,"What, I'm just gonna carry around pictures of my child, where anyone could see them?"
Donna Meagle,"Well, it's funny you should mention privacy, because that's our next topic."
Leslie Knope,"Ron technically works for Gryzzl, and when he finds out what Gryzzl is doing, he is going to lose his mind."
Ron Swanson,I have no reaction to this.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ron Swanson,"I do not pass judgment on the workings of private businesses, I just build their buildings."
Ron Swanson,"And frankly, if people are foolish enough to carry around a doodad that lets Gryzzl track their every move, this is what they get."
Ben Wyatt,But it's illegal.
Ron Swanson,I don't believe that's true.
Ron Swanson,"I've spent a fair amount of time with Gryzzl's highpriced lawyers, and they do seem to, as they say, ""Keep it 100."""
Donna Meagle,"Well, those fools still think I work for them."
Donna Meagle,"So, I can get you a private VIP tour of the building, maybe you can snoop around."
Roscoe,"Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe."
Roscoe,Psyched to give you guys a tour.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, hello."
Leslie Knope,"I'm Darlene Johannsen, and this is my assistant turned lover, Gregory Strong."
Leslie Knope,"Ours is a new romance, but one that sent shockwaves through my architecture firm."
Leslie Knope,But it feels so right.
Ben Wyatt,Steady.
Leslie Knope,We love Gryzzl and we would love to see how it all works.
Roscoe,Sweet.
Roscoe,Let's get loco.
April Ludgate,"Okay, so, let's get to know each other."
April Ludgate,"Talk about why you're here, whether you're throwing your lives away, stuff like that."
April Ludgate,"You, what brought you here?"
Extra,I love the Parks Department.
Extra,I grew up near Ramsett Park and I used to go to tons of stuff there.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,That doesn't help me.
April Ludgate,Mork?
Extra,"Oh, It's Mike."
Extra,I love parks more than anything.
Extra,And I've been a summer camp counselor since I was 13.
April Ludgate,Ugh!
April Ludgate,Gross.
April Ludgate,What about you?
April Ludgate,Why are you here?
Jen,The only thing I love more than parks is recreation.
April Ludgate,Really?
Jen,No.
Jen,I just needed a college credit.
April Ludgate,What are you studying?
Jen,Nothing.
Jen,College is stupid.
April Ludgate,Then who made you do this?
Jen,My parents.
April Ludgate,What are they like?
Jen,"Well, my mom's the devil and my dad's a dumb doctor."
Extra,My dad's a doctor.
April Ludgate,Shut up.
April Ludgate,"Jen, is it?"
Jen,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Let's take a walk, Jen."
April Ludgate,I feel like you have almost zero potential.
April Ludgate,I think that's cool.
Extra,"And, action."
Andy Dwyer,"We meet again, Puppy Hating Dan."
Andy Dwyer,You stole my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,And you put farts in my lunch!
Andy Dwyer,You've really done it this time.
Andy Dwyer,"Puppy Army, attack!"
Extra,Yeah!
Burly,What?
Burly,No!
Burly,I hate puppies!
Burly,I'll admit to everything!
Burly,"You win again, Macklin!"
Andy Dwyer,Another mystery solved!
Andy Dwyer,We'll be right back after this with some more Johnny Karate.
Extra,"Hey, that's lunch everyone."
Extra,We're back in 30 minutes.
Tom Haverford,"Great job, bud."
Tom Haverford,You crushed it.
Tom Haverford,I love being Andy's agent.
Tom Haverford,"He does all the work, and I get 10% just for showing up."
Tom Haverford,"It's like a chef at a restaurant making all the food and then the owner gets the profit, which is my other job."
Tom Haverford,"Man, I really got things figured out."
Hank Muntak,Let's make this quick.
Tom Haverford,Andy's show gets huge ratings in three cities.
Tom Haverford,His GryzzlTube page has millions of views.
Tom Haverford,"If you don't want Andy walking over to your rival station in Snerling, I think you should start taking this seriously."
Hank Muntak,"Okay, here's what we're gonna do."
Hank Muntak,I'm gonna upgrade the parking spot.
Hank Muntak,"But my son gets a role as one of the kid ninjas, all right?"
Hank Muntak,He's gonna love me for it.
Hank Muntak,It's gonna drive my exwife crazy.
Tom Haverford,"So far, so good."
Tom Haverford,"But, in the words of Jerry Maguire"
Andy Dwyer,The human head weighs 8 pounds.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,"""Show me the money."""
Hank Muntak,"Andy, do you know how lucky you are to work here?"
Hank Muntak,I'm a kingmaker.
Hank Muntak,"Pip Wiley, Chuck Warschank, Selena Gomez."
Hank Muntak,I made them.
Tom Haverford,You discovered Selena Gomez?
Hank Muntak,Different Selena Gomez.
Hank Muntak,"Look, I don't have the money for a raise."
Tom Haverford,"Uh Yeah, you do."
Tom Haverford,I've seen profit reports.
Tom Haverford,The show is a bonanza.
Tom Haverford,Andy starts making $500 a week.
Tom Haverford,Now.
Hank Muntak,Get the hell out of my office.
Tom Haverford,Sit down.
April Ludgate,"Look, dude, this internship leads nowhere."
April Ludgate,It'll just screw up the rest of your life.
April Ludgate,What do you love doing?
Jen,Texting.
April Ludgate,What did you wanna be when you were little?
Jen,A scary mermaid that lures sailors to their death.
April Ludgate,"Okay, side note, I'm gonna file papers to adopt you as my child, so keep an eye out for that."
April Ludgate,"But more importantly, don't do this internship."
April Ludgate,"Go do something fun, like trying to control birds with your mind, or posting Internet comments as Michael Jackson's ghost."
Jen,Okay.
Jen,Maybe you're right.
Jen,Thanks.
Extra,"Hey, April!"
Extra,We finished those questionnaires you gave us about our hopes and dreams for the internship.
April Ludgate,Great.
April Ludgate,"Thanks, Mike."
Roscoe,I'm sorry this building is so lame.
Roscoe,"As soon as we get our new headquarters built, it's gonna be way, way tighter."
Roscoe,Check it.
Roscoe,Matty.
Roscoe,"Okay, this is GryzzlVibe."
Roscoe,It's this new app that we're developing that monitors your mood.
Extra,Tell them about it.
Extra,"As you know, the cameras on your phones are always on, whether you're using them or not."
Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry?
Ben Wyatt,They are?
Extra,This app uses facial recognition software to track your expressions.
Extra,It's always watching.
Leslie Knope,"Well, what do you do with this information?"
Roscoe,"Well, if the camera senses that you're in a bad mood, then we could geomatch you to, say, the nearest cup of sweet pick me up java."
Roscoe,"But, if you're in a good mood, then we could geonudge you to, like, a sweet coffee shop."
Roscoe,You could just keep the good times rolling.
Ben Wyatt,So it's really just a coffee sales app.
Roscoe,Yeah.
Roscoe,"Yeah, we're developing with Starbucks."
Extra,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl know all the things that someone wants?"
Leslie Knope,"Are you guys, I don't know, whatever, datamining?"
Roscoe,"Oh, hells yeah, dogman!"
Roscoe,"Our super rad algorithm searches all your texts, calls, banking, medical records, blah, blah, blah, to learn what you really want."
Roscoe,"You know, from snacks, to new books and movies, to when you ladies need to score some new 'pons."
Roscoe,"I mean, we might know you better than you know yourself, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,How did you know it was me?
Roscoe,It was about 40 different ways.
Roscoe,"I mean, geomaps on all your different Gryzzl devices."
Roscoe,"And, of course, we facescanned you when you came in."
Roscoe,We're really glad you're here.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,Just 'cause we're competing for the Newport land doesn't mean that we can't be friends.
Roscoe,No.
Leslie Knope,Isn't that your motto?
Leslie Knope,"""Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?"""
Roscoe,Totes.
Roscoe,And I hope that you can see now that there's nothing scary about Gryzzl.
Roscoe,"I mean, we just wanna learn everything about everyone, and track them wherever they go, and anticipate what they're about to do."
Leslie Knope,"These are really interesting issues, Roscoe."
Leslie Knope,"I think maybe we could debate them, you know, on TV."
Roscoe,TV.
Roscoe,Retro.
Roscoe,I love it.
Roscoe,All right.
Roscoe,I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.
Extra,Skate mode activated.
Roscoe,"Later, chillers."
Extra,"This is The Perdples Court, a legal debate show about issues facing residents of Southern Indiana."
Extra,"With your host, Judge Perd Hapley."
Perd Hapley,"Tonight on The Perdples Court, we will have the guests that have been booked for tonight's show."
Perd Hapley,"The plaintiff, Leslie Knope, who has some big allegations against Gryzzl."
Perd Hapley,"The defendant, Gryzzl Vice President Roscoe Santangelo."
Perd Hapley,Who will win?
Perd Hapley,I don't know yet.
Perd Hapley,Which is what makes this a court show.
Leslie Knope,"We have public opinion on our side, and we have proof that Gryzzl has been datamining."
Leslie Knope,But there's one more thing we need.
Leslie Knope,The one thing that Americans respect more than anything else.
Leslie Knope,Public humiliation on live television.
Ron Swanson,"Leslie, do not go on television."
Donna Meagle,Swanson?
Donna Meagle,What are you doing here?
Ron Swanson,This is the 27th version of the Pawnee Gryzzl free wireless Internet thing agreement.
Ron Swanson,Check out the page I marked.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Gryzzl is not allowed to collect and use customer data for any purposes.
Ben Wyatt,It's pretty clear.
Ben Wyatt,See?
Ron Swanson,Look closer.
Ron Swanson,"Amendment C, addendum 14."
Ron Swanson,"It directs you to this appendix, which reroutes you to this one, which says, in a subfootnote"
Ben Wyatt,It says here they can gather and use any information they want.
Ben Wyatt,How did I miss this?
Leslie Knope,Look at the revision date.
Leslie Knope,"December 18th, 2015."
Leslie Knope,That was the opening day of Episode VII.
Leslie Knope,You were muttering that date in your sleep for months.
Leslie Knope,They knew you'd be distracted.
Leslie Knope,That's how they slipped it in.
Ben Wyatt,I did this to the town.
Ben Wyatt,It's my fault.
Ben Wyatt,It's Ice Town all over again.
Ron Swanson,Is Star Wars the one with the little wizard boy?
Hank Muntak,"Okay, this is what I can give you."
Hank Muntak,"No more janitorial duties, better parking spot, unlimited Mike and Ikes from the vending machine, and for salary, we're at 500 a week."
Andy Dwyer,500 whats?
Tom Haverford,"Dollars, man."
Tom Haverford,What about the rights to Johnny Karate?
Hank Muntak,We own the rights to Johnny Karate.
Hank Muntak,I can't bend on that one.
Andy Dwyer,But I invented the character.
Hank Muntak,"Well, invent another character."
Hank Muntak,"Uh Here you go, KungFu Billy."
Hank Muntak,Jeremy Punch Guy.
Hank Muntak,Ed Kick.
Andy Dwyer,Those are actually pretty great.
Andy Dwyer,But Johnny Karate is special to me.
Andy Dwyer,"If we can't get the rights, I'm gonna walk."
Hank Muntak,He's making the biggest mistake of his life.
Hank Muntak,He's walking out on Hank Muntak?
Hank Muntak,I have six Lower Great Lakes Emmy Awards.
Hank Muntak,I once sat in the original Batmobile.
Hank Muntak,James Woods follows my niece on Twitter.
Hank Muntak,He's gonna regret this.
Ben Wyatt,"All of this work, everything I've done for this city, it's all a wash now."
Ben Wyatt,Everyone's gonna hate me again.
Donna Meagle,"Some of us are already there, Wyatt."
Leslie Knope,This is not your fault.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, talk some sense into him."
Ron Swanson,Ben's right.
Ron Swanson,This is Ice Town all over again.
Leslie Knope,Ron!
Ron Swanson,"If you're gonna sign a legally binding document, you need to read it thoroughly."
Ron Swanson,That's why the only contract I've ever signed was my Mulligan's Steakhouse Club Card.
Ron Swanson,"And even then, I used a fake name."
Ron Swanson,Les.
Ron Swanson,Les Vegetables.
Leslie Knope,"Don't worry, okay?"
Leslie Knope,You're not gonna take the fall for this.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, make sure that Donna doesn't hurt him."
April Ludgate,You wanted to see me?
Craig Middlebrooks,Yes.
Craig Middlebrooks,Can you tell me where Jennifer is?
April Ludgate,I convinced her to quit.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Martha Stewart's apron line, my tomato plants-- Oh, God, I'm out."
Craig Middlebrooks,Where's my emergency list?
April Ludgate,"Recently I've been feeling like I've wasted the last 10 years of my life, and it all started with this internship."
April Ludgate,"And I don't want those kids to make the same mistake, okay?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"April, you spent the last 10 years doing amazing things with this Parks Department, and learning from the greatest teacher in this or any business, Leslie Freaking Knope."
Craig Middlebrooks,You'd be a checkout girl at a gas station if it wasn't for that internship!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Sweet potato pie, unlikely animal friend pairings, Jennifer Love Hewitt."
Craig Middlebrooks,"You're lucky to have worked here, no matter what you wanna do with the rest of your life."
Craig Middlebrooks,And I think you know that.
Craig Middlebrooks,"And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go find a new intern."
Perd Hapley,"Now, Leslie, I understand that what you've brought to the show isn't a box of objects, but rather a symbolic box of allegations."
Leslie Knope,"Well, Perd--"
Perd Hapley,It's Judge Perd.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I think there are certain questions about certain aspects of certain parts of this situation that require an evaluation about whether or not this is or is not a valid argument.
Perd Hapley,Extremely well put.
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, Judge Perd."
Ben Wyatt,"I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager."
Ben Wyatt,"What Gryzzl is doing with our private information may not technically be illegal, but it's definitely not chill."
Roscoe,Whoa!
Roscoe,"That's a serious allegaysh, homie."
Roscoe,We are hella chill.
Roscoe,"And frankly, if you don't like our vibe, you don't have to use our shizz."
Ben Wyatt," Well, we kind of do."
Ben Wyatt," I mean, the Internet is no longer optional."
Ben Wyatt, It's a necessity for everyone.
Ben Wyatt," And I think you do know that data-mining isn't chill, because you snuck it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement."
Ben Wyatt, A person should not have to have an advanced law degree to avoid being taken advantage of by a multibillion dollar company.
Ben Wyatt, You should be upfront about what you're doing and allow people the ability to opt out.
Perd Hapley," To be honest, Judge Perd is stumped by this case."
Perd Hapley, I've also misplaced my judge hammer.
Perd Hapley, I cannot render a verdict here.
Perd Hapley," Therefore, I must declare a mistrial, which is a term I've heard people use in the movies."
Perd Hapley," Tap, tap, tap."
Perd Hapley, Case ended.
Extra, And we're clear.
Roscoe, All right.
Roscoe," Later, dudes."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, good news."
Andy Dwyer, I think I found a job.
Andy Dwyer, There was an opening for a janitor at the TV station.
Andy Dwyer," Get this, they're gonna pay me the minimum wage."
Tom Haverford," Put your mop down, bud."
Tom Haverford, I got you the rights to Johnny Karate.
Andy Dwyer, No way.
Andy Dwyer, How?
Tom Haverford,"Just a great agent, I guess."
Tom Haverford," Please, man, please! Andy's my friend and I want to do a good job, and there's this girl I really like and she lives in Chicago."
Tom Haverford, And she's still dating someone.
Tom Haverford,I just feel like--
Hank Muntak," Oh, God."
Tom Haverford, Do you wanna eat at my restaurant for free? Every week.
Tom Haverford, You can come once a week.
Tom Haverford, It's free.
Hank Muntak," Hey, okay."
Hank Muntak, Fine.
Hank Muntak, Just stop.
Andy Dwyer, See? I told you it was gonna work out.
Andy Dwyer, That's actually really good advice for anything.
Andy Dwyer," If there's something that you want badly, you just have to believe that it's gonna work out."
April Ludgate, Hey.
April Ludgate, I am sorry that I screwed up your life.
April Ludgate, I found a bunch of new potential interns to replace Jen.
Extra, Hi.
Craig Middlebrooks, How'd you manage that?
April Ludgate,"I just thought, ""What would Leslie do?"" So I handed out flyers and I canvassed the college."
April Ludgate, I even baked a bunch of cookies.
April Ludgate, It was weird.
April Ludgate, I actually really enjoyed finding them.
April Ludgate, And I enjoyed bullying Jen into quitting.
Craig Middlebrooks, Hmm.
Craig Middlebrooks, You should add telling people what to do to your perfect job description.
April Ludgate, Good idea.
April Ludgate," You should up your therapy to seven times a week, stop dressing that way and give me your wallet."
Craig Middlebrooks," Victor Garber, James Garner, Jennifer Garner."
Craig Middlebrooks, I go alphabetical now.
Tom Haverford, Hey! You're back.
Tom Haverford, How was the trip?
Lucy, It was okay.
Lucy, Kind of weird.
Tom Haverford," Weird couple of days for me, too."
Tom Haverford," Closed a bunch of deals, did a bunch of crunches…"
Lucy,Yeah.
Lucy, I broke up with Conrad.
Lucy, Which was a long time coming but it's still weird.
Tom Haverford, Yeah.
Tom Haverford, Do you want to talk about it?
Lucy,Thanks.
Lucy, I don't think I'm ready to discuss it just yet.
Lucy, But what I would like to do is have a glass of wine and talk about that shade Nicki Minaj threw at Jesse Eisenberg at the BAFTAs.
Tom Haverford, He deserved it.
Lucy," No, he didn't!"
Tom Haverford,Uh Settle in.
Tom Haverford, Because I have some very strong feelings about this.
Leslie Knope, They're all down.
Ben Wyatt, Thank God.
Ben Wyatt, Sometimes I think they're somehow the first humans who don't need sleep.
Leslie Knope, Look.
Leslie Knope," This Gryzzl thing, it's complicated, but this isn't Ice Town."
Leslie Knope," You have done so much for this town, and people know that."
Ben Wyatt, I'm just sorry we couldn't find something illegal on Gryzzl.
Ben Wyatt," If we're gonna stop them, and you're gonna beat them on the Newport land, we need more ammo."
Ron Swanson, We need to talk.
Ben Wyatt, What is that?
Ron Swanson,This is a flying robot I just shot out of the sky after it delivered a package to my house.
Leslie Knope, I thought you didn't like to pass judgment on--
Ron Swanson,The package was addressed to my son.
Ron Swanson, Who is four years old and does not own a Gryzzl doodad.
Ron Swanson, Somehow the robots looked at Diane's computer and learned something about my child and then brought him a box of presents.
Ron Swanson, So I destroyed the robot.
Ron Swanson, No one is safe from these bastards.
Ron Swanson," Tell me what to do, Leslie."
Ron Swanson, I wanna help you take 'em down.

,Season: 7 Episode: 06
Tom Haverford,In front of you are six different wedding cakes from the top restaurants in Pawnee.
Tom Haverford,"Sample each one, and rank your two top favorites in the ballots provided."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, boy."
Jerry Gergich,"They're all so good, I can't pick just two."
Tom Haverford,"Well, then you leave, Terry."
Tom Haverford,And pay for the cake you already ate.
Joe,I like the vanilla one with the lemon cream.
Craig Middlebrooks,"That was a joke cake I got from the grocery store, to weed out low quality palates."
Donna Meagle,"Maybe it's because he's my fiance and I love him, but I kind of like the grocery store one, too."
Tom Haverford,There's actually one more cake you haven't tried yet.
Tom Haverford,Donna has chosen me to be the Butler of Honor at her wedding.
Tom Haverford,"Now, granted, ""Butler of Honor"" is a term I made up, but it's not a job I take lightly."
Tom Haverford,That's why I'm about to give her a surprise bigger than when LeBron went back to Miami.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God."
Donna Meagle,DJ Bluntz?
Donna Meagle,What is happening right now?
Tom Haverford,I think you know what's happening.
Joe,"But but for real, though."
Joe,What what's happening?
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self.
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self 2017!
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self 2017!
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God!"
Donna Meagle,Is this for real?
Tom Haverford,"Oh, it's for real."
Tom Haverford,And it's the biggest one yet.
Joe,I still don't know what's happening.
Joe,"So, what's happening?"
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self!
Joe,Not an answer to my question.
Donna Meagle,"Oh, my God, read the cake."
Joe,Still unclear.
Joe,"Terry, what's happening?"
Jerry Gergich,Treat Yo' Self.
Tom Haverford,It's the best day of the year!
Donna Meagle,It's the best day of the year!
Trodd,"Roscoe, people in this town are very angry about Gryzzl's data mining program."
Trodd,"In your opinion, have you done anything wrong?"
Roscoe,"We did not believe that we did anything to invade people's privacy, Trodd."
Roscoe,"But then, we checked thousands of emails and texts between our customers and their loved ones, and it seemed like people thought we were wrong."
Trodd,Gryzzl's currently trying to buy an enormous parcel of land to build a permanent headquarters in Pawnee.
Trodd,How will you win back our trust?
Roscoe,We are gonna be throwing a free concert with U2 and Beyonce.
Roscoe,"Tickets are already on your phones, seating is gonna be organized by income and sexual history."
Roscoe,"And that, I swear, is the last time that we will be peeking inside your computers."
Leslie Knope,"Wow, Gryzzl is scrambling."
Leslie Knope,"And for the first time in this land battle, they are vulnerable and we are gonna capitalize on it with something big and exciting."
Andy Dwyer,I've got something big and exciting.
Andy Dwyer,All we need is a blimp and a decoy blimp.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"For what I hope is the last time, but we'll assume is not the last time, our strategy does not involve blimps."
Leslie Knope,We already have an idea.
Leslie Knope,April?
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Our new proposal will ask them to split the land.
April Ludgate,Gryzzl will take half for their campus and then donate the rest to National Parks.
April Ludgate,"It's not ideal, but they may go for it because of how bad they screwed up."
Ron Swanson,"I am not a spy, and I would never reveal classified information."
Ben Wyatt,Do you have to say that every time?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,But I know Gryzzl is dead set on owning the entire parcel.
Ron Swanson,I'm not sure this plan will work.
Leslie Knope,"Well, if it doesn't, something will."
Leslie Knope,"Because when you and I team up, great things happen."
Leslie Knope,"Ron and I had a little falling out, but we are back, baby."
Leslie Knope,"And just like Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, we are totally in sync."
Leslie Knope,Come on.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Just give me a... We're in sync emotionally.
Leslie Knope,Stop patting my head.
Ben Wyatt,Huh.
Ben Wyatt,Looks like Newport Trust is making an announcement.
Jessica Wicks,"Last week, the Newport Trust told Gryzzl, in no uncertain terms, that we would not do business with a company that invades our privacy."
Jessica Wicks,"Then, Gryzzl upped their offer to $125 million, and I swear to God, y'all, I nearly fainted."
Jessica Wicks,So we are officially jumping the gun and selling to Gryzzl for $125 million.
Leslie Knope,What?
Jessica Wicks,Let me repeat that because it makes me very horny.
Ron Swanson,"C'mon, Knope."
Jessica Wicks,$125 million.
Ron Swanson,How about we go drown our sorrows in some waffles?
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self
Lucy,"Hey, boss."
Lucy,"Before you go, can you sign some checks?"
Lucy,Do mine first.
Lucy,"In case something happens to you, I wanna make sure I get paid."
Tom Haverford,Looking out for number one.
Tom Haverford,Always smart.
Tom Haverford,"So, how is post-breakup life?"
Lucy,"Well, breakups are famously super fun and make everyone feel awesome."
Lucy,"So, it's no different."
Donna Meagle,You should come to my wedding.
Donna Meagle,It's gonna be hella fun.
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, you should come with me."
Tom Haverford,"As, like, a plus-one type thing."
Tom Haverford,Maybe we just go as work friends.
Tom Haverford,"Maybe it's just even, you know, boss, employee type thing."
Tom Haverford,You know what?
Tom Haverford,That's what you should do.
Tom Haverford,You should come to the wedding... And do paperwork.
Lucy,"Stop, you're making this sound almost too fun."
Tom Haverford,"Whatever, just text me when you decide."
Tom Haverford,I literally couldn't care less.
Tom Haverford,"So, yeah."
Tom Haverford,"Let's hit it, Donna."
Donna Meagle,"Um, can we talk about that disastrous interaction you just had with Lucy?"
Tom Haverford,Nope.
Tom Haverford,All we're talking about is treating yo' self.
Tom Haverford,Today is about one thing.
Tom Haverford,Things.
Tom Haverford,"Things, Donna!"
Tom Haverford,Our favorite.
Donna Meagle,"Well, where is Bluntz taking us?"
Donna Meagle,This is not the way to the mall.
Tom Haverford,That's 'cause we're not going to the mall.
Tom Haverford,We're finally gonna do something we've always talked about.
Donna Meagle,No way.
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self.
Tom Haverford,In Beverly Hills!
Leslie Knope,All I wanted was valued at 100 million dollars given to me for free.
Leslie Knope,Is that too much to ask?
April Ludgate,I'll say it again.
April Ludgate,Voodoo is still an option.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,It's over.
Leslie Knope,They won.
Leslie Knope,Everything is changing.
Leslie Knope,This town is gonna be unrecognizable in 10 years.
Leslie Knope,Even JJ's Diner is disappearing.
JJ,What can I get you guys?
Leslie Knope,However many waffles it takes to keep you in business.
Leslie Knope,I'm happy with some of the changes that Pawnee has gone through.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, the standard of living is up, we have pressed juice bars, and yoga studios, and a pet hotel."
Leslie Knope,But I think the town is losing some of its charm.
Leslie Knope,And there's too much kale now.
Leslie Knope,One place asked me if I wanted kale in my milkshake.
Leslie Knope,"My milkshake, you guys."
Ron Swanson,"Even though I'm a firm believer in the free market, and your failure as a businessman is ultimately to blame, it's still a travesty your diner is closing."
JJ,"Well, I agree with you."
JJ,But the guy who bought the property didn't even give me a chance to re-up the lease.
JJ,Can't win 'em all.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Enough is enough.
Leslie Knope,"They may have taken that land, but I will be damned if they take my waffles."
Leslie Knope,JJ.
JJ,What?
JJ,Is something wrong?
Leslie Knope,"No, nothing is ever wrong here."
Leslie Knope,That's why we are gonna fight hard to save your diner.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you said your new landlord didn't give you a chance to counter."
Ben Wyatt,Who is it?
JJ,It was a company with a weird sounding name.
JJ,Hang on.
Andy Dwyer,Was it Putin?
Andy Dwyer,"Voldemort Putin, of Russia?"
Andy Dwyer,I'd love to take that bastard down.
JJ,Here it is.
JJ,"""Thigh Gap, LLC Owner, Dennis Feinstein."""
Leslie Knope,The cologne guy?
Leslie Knope,"Ugh, figures."
Leslie Knope,That guy is the worst.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,We are gonna take him down with an old fashioned public rally.
Leslie Knope,"April, I need you to get the word out, with whatever method of communication young people are using these days."
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah."
April Ludgate,Tiny rolled up scrolls delivered by trained foxes.
April Ludgate,I'm on it.
Leslie Knope,"Andy, you thinking what I'm thinking?"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, hell, yeah."
Andy Dwyer,Blimp time.
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,I think this is a job for Jonathan Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Awesome.
Andy Dwyer,Even better.
Leslie Knope,"Ron, what do you say?"
Leslie Knope,Dynamic duo get together one more time to try to save JJ's Diner?
Ron Swanson,I can't think of anything more noble to go to war over than bacon and eggs.
Leslie Knope,"Hear, hear."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, well."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we'll keep practicing."
Leslie Knope,"All right, everybody, listen up."
Leslie Knope,We're here today because JJ's Diner has been a part of Pawnee for 41 years.
Leslie Knope,"And this man, right here, built that diner from the ground up, with his own two hands."
JJ,That's not true.
Leslie Knope,"It's called ""constructing a narrative,"" JJ."
Leslie Knope,"You stick to the breakfast, I'll deal with the politics."
Leslie Knope,"So, now, let's hear from a man who knows the value of things staying the same."
Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson,I do not like rallies.
Ron Swanson,"And based on what I see from this vantage point, I do not like most of you."
Ron Swanson,What I do like is breakfast food.
Ron Swanson,"JJ's has very good breakfast food, so it should remain open."
Ron Swanson,Please do not approach me on the street after this event and attempt to talk to me.
Ron Swanson,Our similarities begin and end with this single issue.
Ron Swanson,Ron Swanson.
Extra,Can I help you?
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,We are here to see Dennis Feinstein.
Andy Dwyer,The appointment should be under Karate.
Andy Dwyer,Jonathan Karate.
Extra,"Um, I don't see a ""Jonathan Karate"" anywhere."
Andy Dwyer,Exactly.
Andy Dwyer,"Occasionally on my show, we deal with real issues like bullying, peer pressure, or holding in farts."
Andy Dwyer,"In those very special episodes, I become Jonathan Karate, the very serious older brother of Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,Jonathan Karate tells it like it is.
Andy Dwyer,He makes people do the right thing.
Dennis Feinstein,"Oh, baby."
Dennis Feinstein,That feels amazing.
Dennis Feinstein,"But I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go."
Dennis Feinstein,I have to meet Rick and TC at the King Kamehameha Club.
Dennis Feinstein,Higgins is missing.
Andy Dwyer,Dennis Feinstein.
Dennis Feinstein,What?
Dennis Feinstein,Who's that?
Andy Dwyer,My name is Jonathan Karate.
Andy Dwyer,We need to talk.
Dennis Feinstein,"Well, make it quick."
Dennis Feinstein,I gotta go pull the plug on my dad in 10 minutes.
Andy Dwyer,I heard you were buying JJ's Diner and kicking everybody out.
Dennis Feinstein,That's true.
Dennis Feinstein,Real estate prices in this turd town are through the roof.
Dennis Feinstein,I'm gonna turn that place into an elbow art salon and make a killing.
Dennis Feinstein,"Plus, who's gonna miss some dumpy diner?"
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you ask the people gathering outside of your building right now?
Dennis Feinstein,Hmm?
Leslie Knope,What do we want?
All,Breakfast!
Leslie Knope,When do we want it?
All,Forever!
Dennis Feinstein,I had no idea this place was so loved.
Dennis Feinstein,This could be bad for business.
Andy Dwyer,Then come with me.
Andy Dwyer,Tell the people that JJ's can stay.
Dennis Feinstein,Okay.
Dennis Feinstein,"Plus, you should get these kids out of here."
Dennis Feinstein,"Not to brag, but my colognes have been known to stunt human growth, so…"
Andy Dwyer,Ninjas!
Andy Dwyer,Scatter.
Dennis Feinstein,You got 'em well trained.
Donna Meagle,Treat Yo' Self in Beverly Hills
Tom Haverford,Treat Yo' Self in Beverly Hills
Extra,Donna.
Extra,Donna.
Extra,Donna.
Extra,"Can we get one right here, please?"
Extra,Right here.
Extra,Right here.
Extra,"Ladies and gentleman, off to our right, you can see the house that belongs to Bruce Willis and Christina Aguilera."
Extra,And to our left is Usher's Los Angeles residence.
Donna Meagle,Usher's house!
Tom Haverford,Usher's house!
Donna Meagle,Usher's star!
Tom Haverford,Usher's star!
Extra,"So, for the basic elbow bedazzling, it's 140."
Extra,Custom art starts at 250.
Donna Meagle,I would like three big-ass diamonds surrounded by their own set of tiny-ass diamonds.
Extra,"That would fall into our supreme collection, 600."
Donna Meagle,"Thomas, what do you suggest?"
Tom Haverford,Uh Treat yo' self.
Donna Meagle,"Trish, the gentleman is right."
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna go ahead and treat myself.
Tom Haverford,LASIK for fingernails?
Tom Haverford,I came up with that.
Extra,You want it?
Extra,It's 275.
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,"Laser my nails off, please."
Leslie Knope,We can't bulldoze our entire history.
Leslie Knope,We need to preserve the things that make Pawnee great.
Leslie Knope,Like JJ's Diner.
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Dennis Feinstein,Stop the clock.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, speak of the devil."
Leslie Knope,"Ladies and gentlemen, the devil, Dennis Feinstein."
Dennis Feinstein,Hey now.
Dennis Feinstein,Hang on.
Dennis Feinstein,"Now, Leslie, I think everybody's gonna wanna hear what I have to say."
Dennis Feinstein,Thank you.
Dennis Feinstein,"People of Pawnee, I just came down here to tell you how much I appreciate your passion."
Dennis Feinstein,You've been heard loud and clear.
Dennis Feinstein,You convinced me.
Dennis Feinstein,JJ's can stay.
Leslie Knope,Yeah!
Dennis Feinstein,"I just have one more thing to say, Pawnee."
Dennis Feinstein,Psych!
Dennis Feinstein,Do you think I care about how much you love this stupid diner?
Dennis Feinstein,I bought it for a song and I'm gonna sell it for a mint and you can all just sit there pulling on your puds.
Dennis Feinstein,"Oh, yeah."
Dennis Feinstein,Give me your boos!
Dennis Feinstein,I am nourished by your hatred!
Dennis Feinstein,"I should also let you know, you are all trespassing on private property."
Dennis Feinstein,Release the Hounds!
Ron Swanson,What hounds?
Dennis Feinstein,The Hounds is an FDA rejected cologne I've been working on that makes everything smell like wet dog.
Dennis Feinstein,Make it rain!
Dennis Feinstein,Ooh!
Dennis Feinstein,I gotta go kill my dad.
Dennis Feinstein,Let's go.
Leslie Knope,"I am sorry, JJ, that I gave you false hope."
Leslie Knope,"This is a lost cause, just like my stupid park."
Andy Dwyer,Screw that.
Andy Dwyer,There's gotta be another way.
Andy Dwyer,"What if we steal the keys to Feinstein's building, break in, and TP his office, film the whole thing."
Andy Dwyer,We'd definitely get on a prank show.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I love your energy, Andy, but it's not gonna help us keep JJ's where it is."
April Ludgate,Does it have to stay where it is?
April Ludgate,"There's, like, a ton of buildings near where Andy and I live, and they're all super cheap because they're empty and disgusting."
Leslie Knope,Great!
Leslie Knope,I'm in.
Leslie Knope,Anything to get away from this cologne smell.
Ben Wyatt,Ooh.
Ben Wyatt,Water makes it worse.
Ben Wyatt,Water makes it worse.
Tom Haverford,This is the hottest restaurant in LA.
Tom Haverford,All the sushi is made from fish previously owned by celebrities.
Extra,"Okay, this is Charlize Theron's yellowtail, here we have Paul Reiser's salmon, and Peter Bogdanovich's saltwater eel."
Extra,Enjoy.
Donna Meagle,Mmm!
Donna Meagle,Bogdano delish.
Donna Meagle,"Man, you got it bad."
Donna Meagle,I know you're checking your phone every five minutes to see if Lucy will come with you to my wedding.
Tom Haverford,I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle,"Hey, I understand."
Donna Meagle,Which is why I got you something.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, you're not supposed to get me anything."
Tom Haverford,This is your special day.
Donna Meagle,I didn't buy you anything.
Donna Meagle,What I have for you is a piece of advice.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, damn."
Tom Haverford,"I was secretly hoping you got me the shoes Jaden Smith wears in Hitch 2, Son of a Hitch."
Donna Meagle,"My advice to you is, if you want to be with Lucy, you have to be upfront with her about it."
Donna Meagle,Be a man and ask her out.
Tom Haverford,She works for me.
Tom Haverford,She uprooted her whole life to move to Pawnee for this job.
Tom Haverford,I don't want to make it weird.
Tom Haverford,And what if she says no?
Tom Haverford,What if I'm the only one that caught feelings?
Donna Meagle,You won't know until you ask.
Donna Meagle,"Basically, Tommy, when it comes to matters of the heart, I say, ""Treat yo' self."""
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Donna, it's a great gift."
Donna Meagle,I almost forgot.
Donna Meagle,I did get you them shoes from Hitch 2!
Tom Haverford,"Oh, snap!"
Tom Haverford,That's an even better gift!
Donna Meagle,That's not all.
Donna Meagle,"Look behind you, but don't be obvious."
Josh Groban,"Can I get the ""me"" soft shell crab?"
Tom Haverford,Josh Groban!
Tom Haverford,He's eating his own sushi!
Tom Haverford,That's the most baller thing I've ever seen!
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to Beachview Terrace, the sad, unsalvageable, broken down armpit of Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,We tried to clean up this neighborhood so many times.
Ben Wyatt,Nothing's worked.
Ben Wyatt,"We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago, raccoons ate the wheels right off it."
Leslie Knope,"Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and 10 years ago, when he was elected, he promised to clean it up."
Leslie Knope,"Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name, Beachview Terrace."
Leslie Knope,A more accurate name for this place?
Leslie Knope,Medical Waste Butt Sweat Grove.
Extra,"Hi, sorry I'm late."
Extra,We've had this listing for seven years and no one's ever asked to see it.
Extra,I thought this was a prank call.
April Ludgate,This place has everything.
April Ludgate,"Vermin, bullet holes, a hornet's nest."
JJ,"Look, I appreciate everything that you guys have done for me, but even if I put in the time and the money to refurbish this trash heap, it's not gonna change the fact that no respectable people live in this part of town anymore."
Andy Dwyer,Damn straight.
JJ,Everything would have to magically change.
JJ,"The whole neighborhood would have to suddenly become safe and clean, and have businesses and people who dine out."
April Ludgate,"No, then we'd have to move again."
Leslie Knope,Are you thinking…
Ron Swanson,It's possible.
Leslie Knope,But how would we... PR.
Ron Swanson,PR.
Ron Swanson,Which you could then…
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Right.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, good."
Leslie Knope,"Guys, we have about five days to do three months' worth of work, but if we pull it off, we can rescue JJ's Diner, we can establish a new national park, and we can save Pawnee forever."
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
Herman,I am.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Where'd you come from?
Herman,The floor hole.
Lucy,Hey!
Lucy,How was your trip?
Tom Haverford,"Great, obviously."
Tom Haverford,Bedazzled that elbow.
Lucy,How was everything here?
Lucy,Uneventful.
Lucy,"So, I was thinking about the idea of going to Donna's wedding."
Tom Haverford,"Wait, before you say anything."
Tom Haverford,I don't think you should go to Donna's wedding to supervise catering.
Lucy,Oh.
Tom Haverford,"I want you to come with me, as my date."
Lucy,Oh!
Tom Haverford,"The thing is, you work for me, so it's probably kind of uncool for me to even ask."
Tom Haverford,Which is why I signed these documents transferring day-to-day operations of Tom's Bistro over to Craig.
Tom Haverford,He'll be your boss now.
Tom Haverford, Not me.
Craig Middlebrooks, It's about time.
Craig Middlebrooks," We're losing the cranberry salad, effective immediately!"
Lucy,You don't have to do this.
Tom Haverford," Yeah, I do."
Tom Haverford," You're great at your job, and I want you working here forever, and if you don't have feelings for me, I need you to know that everything is gonna be fine."
Tom Haverford," In fact, forget it."
Tom Haverford, I wasn't even serious.
Tom Haverford, You've been hoaxed! You've been Tommy-ed!
Lucy,Just hold on.
Lucy, I was gonna say that I wouldn't wanna go with you as friends.
Lucy, I wanna go with you as your date.
Tom Haverford, Oh.
Tom Haverford, Cool.
Tom Haverford," Craig, never mind."
Tom Haverford, You can rip these papers up.
Craig Middlebrooks," Well, I wish my reign had lasted longer, but I'm happy with the decisions I made and the people I fired."
Tom Haverford," Oh, God."
Tom Haverford, I'd better get back there.
Roscoe," You guys, I don't know what this is about, but it's 4:13, so you got seven minutes."
Leslie Knope," Well, we just wanted to introduce you to the new home of the Gryzzl campus."
Roscoe, Are you tripping? We just spent $125 million to build our new campus in the Southern Indiana Foothills.
Ron Swanson," And you'll be spending another $100 million, at least, to construct the building, roads, plumbing, electrical."
Leslie Knope," Whereas here at Beachview Terrace, you can take over five entire square blocks of historic Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt, Here's a complete proposal for Gryzzl's new regional corporate headquarters.
Roscoe, Is this paper? Super throwback.
Ron Swanson, My company inspected all the buildings.
Ron Swanson," They are disgusting, I grant you, but the guts are solid."
Ben Wyatt," We've laid out construction costs, retail space options."
Ben Wyatt," You could build a much bigger campus in this neighborhood, and basically break even."
April Ludgate," Plus, the best part, all the buildings come pre-graffitied."
Roscoe, That's true.
Roscoe, We wouldn't have to hire Banksy.
Roscoe," Okay, but we spent hella skrilla on this trill forest."
Roscoe, So what are we supposed to do with that?
Leslie Knope,Here's a far-out idea that just came to the top of my brainium.
Leslie Knope, Why don't you donate that land to the National Park Service?
Leslie Knope,That would be pretty dope.
Leslie Knope, And you could get some baller tax breaks that could help you with that mad stank construction cost.
Leslie Knope, I don't know.
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry, I can't."
Leslie Knope, I can't say these words…
Ben Wyatt,You don't have to…
Roscoe,"Okay, but why couldn't we just build the campus here, and then keep the land or sell it?"
Ron Swanson,You could.
Ron Swanson, But donating it will give you some good PR.
Ron Swanson, Which you desperately need.
Leslie Knope," I mean, look, we are glad that you picked Pawnee, but if you're gonna set up shop here, you need to make a covenant with the city."
Leslie Knope, Show people that you're invested in this town.
Leslie Knope," Start by cleaning up one part of Pawnee, and preserving the other."
Roscoe," Okay, well, I gotta talk to my board, as well as our chief legal counsel and our senior advisory team."
Roscoe," And truthfully, they're all shrooming super hard at Coachella right now."
Roscoe," But as soon as they get back, I'll get into it."
Roscoe," We gotta go, I'm sorry."
Roscoe, We got a meeting.
Andy Dwyer, I'll catch you guys later.
Andy Dwyer, I've got a meeting as well.
Andy Dwyer, See you back at the house.
Ben Wyatt, Andy has a meeting?
Dennis Feinstein,Upload it to my GryzzlGlass.
Dennis Feinstein, Left eye.
Dennis Feinstein, I'm watching porn with my right eye.
Dennis Feinstein, Who did this?
Andy Dwyer,We did.
Andy Dwyer," One way or another, Jonathan Karate always gets his man."
Andy Dwyer," And like that, they were gone."
Andy Dwyer," Go! Wait, where's-- Hey, guys, where's Gavin? Gav? Wait, stop."
Andy Dwyer, There were supposed to be six ninjas.
Andy Dwyer," Where's Gavin? Gavin? Who was Gavin's buddy? Caleb, come on, dude."
Andy Dwyer, Why do we even have a buddy system? Is he in the bathroom? You need to tell me if Gavin is pooping.
Andy Dwyer," No, do not laugh, okay? You're not even Caleb."
Andy Dwyer, You're Gavin.
Andy Dwyer, You're Caleb.
Andy Dwyer," If you're Caleb, where's Hunter? Hunter! Hunter! Okay, who was Hunter's buddy? Hmm? Oh, I was."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, crap."
Andy Dwyer," Oh, Dennis, what a mess."
Dennis Feinstein, You have 30 seconds to get out of this facility.
Leslie Knope," I don't know, Ron."
Leslie Knope," I mean, it's been a week."
Leslie Knope, It might not work.
Ron Swanson, It'll work.
Leslie Knope," But what if it doesn't? What if we did all that research and handed Gryzzl a fully-formed plan to revitalize an entire neighborhood and build a new national park, and their board still says no?"
Ron Swanson,Then you'll be secure in the knowledge that you gave it your best shot.
Ron Swanson, But I do really think they will go for it.
Leslie Knope, What makes you so confident?
Ron Swanson,"A wise woman once told me that whenever you and I team up, good things happen."
Ron Swanson," Also, they called three hours ago, said they approved the plan, and asked me to begin drawings for the renovation."
Leslie Knope, You jerk.
Leslie Knope, You sat on that news and let me stew here for three hours?
Ron Swanson,Yup.
Leslie Knope, You jerk! We did it! You jerk.
Leslie Knope, We did it!
Ron Swanson,Yep.
Ron Swanson, Congratulations.
Ron Swanson, I do not approve of this.
Leslie Knope, Don't care.

Joe,"We're going to have orchids on the all the pews, right?"
Joe,"Because orchids are Donna's favorite flowers, and she's my favorite flower."
Donna Meagle,We're real cute.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Well, of course, there are going to be orchids."
Craig Middlebrooks,You think this is my first time working a side job as a wedding planner for a former coworker?
Joe,No?
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm so sorry.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I mostly have my rage problem under control, but planning is very stressful."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Please, avoid my trigger words, flowers, schedule, vows, bride, groom, food, love, happy, church, event, wedding, and Craig."
Joe,"I'm so sorry, Craig."
Joe,I'm sorry.
Joe,I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle,"April, walk with me."
Donna Meagle,So I chose you as my maid of honor because you've become one of my best friends.
Donna Meagle,And I love you like a sister.
April Ludgate,Ew.
Donna Meagle,"But also, because you're tough."
Donna Meagle,My family arrives tonight.
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,And they're all set with their welcome bags.
April Ludgate,"And I told your brother, LeVondrious, that he is not welcome."
Donna Meagle,"Good, but still, there's going to be 28 Meagles in one room, which means there's gonna be drama."
April Ludgate,I will handle everything.
April Ludgate,I actually care whether you're having a good time and are happy.
April Ludgate,It's weird.
Donna Meagle,The Meagles are a coldblooded crew of judgmental grudgeholders.
Donna Meagle,"My cousin Winnie once forgot to use a coaster at my grandpa's house, and he wrote her out of his will."
Donna Meagle,The last four Meagle family Pictionary tournaments ended at the hospital.
Donna Meagle,"Legally, no more than three Meagles are allowed on an international flight together."
Donna Meagle,But they give great gifts.
Donna Meagle,Got to get that flatware.
Lucy,"Tommy, I was at the nail salon and I picked up some geranium hand cream."
Lucy,Do you want to try it?
Tom Haverford,"Uh, yes."
Tom Haverford,"Warm it up, please."
Tom Haverford,Ooh!
Tom Haverford,That smells nice.
Lucy,"I'm just gonna go and make sure everything is set for tonight, okay?"
Tom Haverford,"All right, see you later."
Lucy,"See you, Ron."
Ron Swanson,I've always liked that Lucy.
Ron Swanson,Glad things are going well.
Tom Haverford,Better than well.
Tom Haverford,And guess what I have planned for tonight.
Ron Swanson,No.
Tom Haverford,"As Donna's butler of honor, I'm going all out."
Tom Haverford,Baby blue brocade.
Tom Haverford,"As a surprise, I got a matching dress for Lucy."
Ron Swanson,And you believe Lucy will be happy with this gift?
Tom Haverford,"A hundred percent, we're so in sync."
Tom Haverford,I finally feel like I'm with the person I'm going to be with forever.
Tom Haverford,I'd marry her tomorrow.
Ron Swanson,"Bully for you, son."
Ron Swanson,"More importantly, do you have tri-tip for tonight?"
Ron Swanson,"Because if not, I brought my own."
Ron Swanson,I love weddings.
Ron Swanson,"Good food, the celebration of romantic love, and most of all, churches."
Ron Swanson,"Say what you will about organized religion, those bastards knew how to construct an edifice."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, monsters."
Leslie Knope,Mommy and Daddy have to pack because we're going to a hotel.
Leslie Knope,But Roz is going to stay here with you.
Roz,"Yeah, and we are going to have so much fun, we're going to play games, we're going to color, maybe we're going to even sit quietly for 30 seconds."
Roz,Do you think I could have 30 seconds?
Roz,That's all--
Leslie Knope,She's fading.
Leslie Knope,"Roz, Roz."
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,You are a wonderful nanny.
Roz,Oh.
Leslie Knope,You're tough and strong.
Leslie Knope,And you're an excellent caretaker for our children.
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, every time you come to our house, we are so happy to see you."
Leslie Knope,I love you more than Ben.
Leslie Knope,I do.
Leslie Knope,"If Ben left me, I would be sad but I would get through it."
Leslie Knope,But if you left me I would never recover.
Roz,Thanks.
Roz,That helps.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm so used to packing for them, I almost put in diapers for myself."
Extra,"Incoming call, Jen Barkley."
Leslie Knope,Jen Barkley is calling again.
Leslie Knope,She's relentless.
Ben Wyatt,Jen is a powerful political operative.
Ben Wyatt,Don't you even want to know what she has to say?
Leslie Knope,"She'll just say what she always says, which is, ""Leslie, would you consider running for state Senate or Congress?"""
Leslie Knope,"And I'll say, ""Jen, thank you very much, that's very flattering but I love my job and I get to do it for the entire country."""
Leslie Knope,The whole world is my park.
Leslie Knope,"Besides, our lives are so chaotic, we can't run a campaign."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, if you really wanted to do it, we'd find a way."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, things aren't that chaotic."
Roz,All three of them just bonked into each other and broke everything you own.
Roz,I don't know what that was.
Gayle Gergich,Oh!
Gayle Gergich,Would you look at that?
Gayle Gergich,"Sweetie, I think your best friend, Tom, is giving his lady friend a gift."
Jerry Gergich,You know Gayle gives me a gift each and every day.
Gayle Gergich,"Oh, I've got the greatest gift of all."
Gayle Gergich,Being married to you.
Jerry Gergich,Oh!
Jerry Gergich,Sweetie!
Ron Swanson,"Control yourselves, Gergiches!"
Lucy,"Damn, Tommy, well done!"
Tom Haverford,I knew you'd like it.
Tom Haverford,"Get changed, baby."
Tom Haverford,We've got to dominate this party.
Lucy,"What do you think, Ron?"
Lucy,Tommy's the man.
Ron Swanson,I normally don't get involved in people's personal affairs but something about a wedding... I'll just say it.
Ron Swanson,Tom is quite taken with you.
Lucy,"He's taken with me, huh?"
Ron Swanson,Yes!
Ron Swanson,"He said he'd ""marry you tomorrow."""
Ben Wyatt,Seems silly to stay at a hotel that's 10 minutes from our house.
Leslie Knope,"It's been three years, we deserve one night away together."
Leslie Knope,A little down time.
Leslie Knope,A little privacy.
Leslie Knope,Maybe we make some more kids?
Ben Wyatt,Don't even joke about that.
Leslie Knope,"Let's just make, like, three more so that each one of them can have a friend."
Leslie Knope,Jen?
Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?
Jennifer Barkley,You idiots won't answer my calls and what I have to tell you cannot wait.
Jennifer Barkley,What's that horrible sound?
Ben Wyatt,Children.
Jennifer Barkley,Ugh!
Jennifer Barkley,Your life is gross.
Jennifer Barkley,My life is amazing.
Leslie Knope,"Jen, thank you so much for coming but we have to go."
Leslie Knope,I have never been late for an event that requires an RSVP.
Jennifer Barkley,"You guys live in Pawnee, Indiana."
Jennifer Barkley,Where do you have to go?
Jennifer Barkley,Puttin' up a new scarecrow?
Ben Wyatt,"Could you, please, just get to the point?"
Jennifer Barkley,Sure.
Jennifer Barkley,"Paul Hartwell, who is your congressional incumbent from this district, is a moron."
Jennifer Barkley,Even by Washington standards.
Jennifer Barkley,But he wins every year because he's a horrible bully and nobody opposes him.
Jennifer Barkley,Till now.
Extra,Indiana's 10th district needs a new leader.
Extra,Someone who's made it a home.
Extra,"Who cares about our citizens, and who understands the local economy."
Leslie Knope,"Jen, I told you."
Leslie Knope,I have a dream job.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to --
Extra,A candidate named Ben Wyatt.
Ben Wyatt,Sorry?
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm dead serious, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,I think you should run for the House of Representatives.
Jennifer Barkley,Whoa!
Jennifer Barkley,What was that?
Jennifer Barkley,That was huge.
Ben Wyatt,"Hang on, this is Congress you're talking about."
Ben Wyatt,Like where... Like bills become laws.
Ben Wyatt,I am not qualified for that.
Jennifer Barkley,"We're talking about the House of Representatives, Ben."
Jennifer Barkley,You might be over qualified.
Jennifer Barkley,"Hartwell's biggest weakness is the economy, which is your exact strength."
Jennifer Barkley,You're young.
Jennifer Barkley,You're smart.
Jennifer Barkley,You're running the biggest city in the district.
Jennifer Barkley,I saw you handle that WiFi thing on TV.
Jennifer Barkley,"My firm is ready to go, as soon as you say the word."
Jennifer Barkley,Are you in or are you out?
Roz,"Uh, two of the three kids are showering in their pajamas, and most of Ben's ties are in the toilet."
Roz,"Just like, as a update of where things are at."
Jennifer Barkley,"I mean, this is chaos."
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, it happened a really long time ago, right?"
Andy Dwyer,And it was probably an accident.
Extra,"Oh, yeah, I'm sure the Dig Dug machine just unplugged itself, right before I was about to beat his high score."
Extra,"Yeah, I'm sure it was an accident."
April Ludgate,"Hey, status report?"
Andy Dwyer,The Meagles are weird.
Andy Dwyer,The words that they say sound passive but seem aggressive.
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like there should be a term for that, like Nicey meany."
April Ludgate,"Yeah, I just had to physically separate two 80 year old men who were arguing about whether it was really Lena Horne in that grocery store in 1970."
April Ludgate,"Okay, you stay on the Key Largo and Denver Meagles, and I will handle the Berlin Meagles."
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Leslie Knope,"So, you're thinking about Jen's offer?"
Ben Wyatt,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, how would this even work?"
Ben Wyatt,"Our lives are so busy, and if I won, I would be a Congressman or woman, I mean, equal rights."
Ben Wyatt,"No, that doesn't apply."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Try this.
Leslie Knope,"Tonight, just act like you've decided to run."
Leslie Knope,"And then tomorrow, at the wedding, act like you've decided not to run."
Leslie Knope,See which one feels better.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,And what do you think I should do?
Leslie Knope,Ben has to run.
Leslie Knope,I don't want to push it because it might backfire but he has to run.
Leslie Knope,He would be good for America.
Leslie Knope,Good for the world.
Leslie Knope,Ben should be the Royal Archduke Sultan Emperor of all inhabitable lands on Earth.
Leslie Knope,I'm completely neutral.
Leslie Knope,I will support you no matter what you do.
Tom Haverford,"You told Lucy, I want to marry her?"
Ron Swanson,"Damn it, son, the small hamburgers!"
Tom Haverford,Ron!
Tom Haverford,You have to walk back what you said.
Ron Swanson,"""Walk back"" sounds like lying."
Tom Haverford,Can you drop your strict life codes for a second and help me out?
Tom Haverford,"Even though I've known Lucy for years, and can see myself spending a life together with her, having children, walking the grounds of Tommy's Bahama, a private island, I'll eventually buy."
Tom Haverford,"That's way in the future, man."
Ron Swanson,"Don't call me, ""Man."""
Tom Haverford,That's what you took away from this?
Tom Haverford,Uh!
Tom Haverford,Don't serve this man.
Tom Haverford,No more food until he fixes the giant disaster he's created.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Starting now, you're in campaign mode."
Leslie Knope,"So first up, meet and greet."
Leslie Knope,"You remember how this goes, right?"
Leslie Knope,Your goal is to act like everyone is interesting and important.
Jerry Gergich,"Hey, guys."
Leslie Knope,Nope.
Leslie Knope,Too hard.
Leslie Knope,Let's try someone else.
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Here's Donna's parents, okay?"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Work your magic.
Ben Wyatt,You got it.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Meagle, I presume."
Extra,"I am Mr. Meagle, but we're divorced."
Extra,I'm Grace Callahan.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I'm sorry Ms. Callahan."
Extra,It's Doctor Callahan.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I hope that you are a podiatrist or a dentist because I seem to have a case of foot in mouth disorder."
April Ludgate,"Hey, guys."
April Ludgate,How's everything going?
Joe,"April, we couldn't be happier and you are an angel for asking."
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it's surprisingly painless."
Donna Meagle,"No swiping, no passive-aggressive comments... No drama at all."
Andy Dwyer,"Here are all the troublemakers, boss."
April Ludgate,Thank you.
April Ludgate,"Meagles, I am not screwing around, okay?"
April Ludgate,"Lauren, no more discussion of Majorca."
April Ludgate,Majorca is off limits.
April Ludgate,"Brian and Gloria, stop making Horatio feel bad that your daughter went to Yale."
April Ludgate,No one gives a [bleep]. And Ginuwine.
Ginuwine,Yes.
April Ludgate,Get it together.
Ginuwine,"I'm sorry, April."
Ginuwine,Kathy started this.
April Ludgate,"""It's Kathy that started"" I don't care!"
Andy Dwyer,She doesn't mean it.
Andy Dwyer,"Don't cry, Ginuwine, it's okay."
Ginuwine,"Thanks, Andy."
April Ludgate,Easy peasy.
April Ludgate,Lemon sneezy.
Ron Swanson,"Lucy, I have something to tell you."
Ron Swanson,I am a liar.
Lucy,What?
Ron Swanson,"Well, no, I am not a liar."
Ron Swanson,I have never lied about anything in my life.
Ron Swanson,"Though, I suppose you could construe camouflage as a lie."
Lucy,What is happening right now?
Ron Swanson,Tom wanted to convey that he likes you a great deal.
Ron Swanson,So he said that he could imagine marrying you and living on an island with your kids.
Lucy,"Wait, now we're on an island?"
Lucy,With kids?
Lucy,Plural?
Ron Swanson,Yes.
Ron Swanson,"Now, do you know where I can find those little ham balls?"
Ben Wyatt,"Watch out for those riding lawnmowers, man."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, you are killing it."
Ben Wyatt,"I am, right?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Ben Wyatt,"See, just thinking I'm a Congressman makes me feel like one."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, also, I have a little secret."
Ben Wyatt,I'm drunk.
Leslie Knope,I am too.
Leslie Knope,"Ever since we had our kids, it only takes, like, one sip of wine."
Ben Wyatt,I feel so good and condifent.
Ben Wyatt,Con... I feel condifent.
Leslie Knope,You know what you should do?
Leslie Knope,You should give a toast.
Leslie Knope,"Because if you were running for Congress, you have to give speeches, right?"
Ben Wyatt,You want me to make a toast?
Ben Wyatt,I'll toast it up.
Leslie Knope,"Toast it, baby."
Leslie Knope,Roast it and toast it till it's brown on both sides!
Ben Wyatt,"Hey everybody, I'm Ben Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"Listen, we, of course, are here to celebrate Donna and Joe."
Ben Wyatt,"And I have to say, you know, getting married is the bravest, most wonderful thing you can do."
Ben Wyatt,"Because every day you come home and you're just like ""What?"""
Ben Wyatt,"""It's you, I love you."""
Ben Wyatt,"""You're my sexy roommate."""
Ben Wyatt,"""We love each other."""
Leslie Knope,Whoo!
Leslie Knope,He's talkin' about me.
Ben Wyatt,"Yes, I am, babydoll."
Ben Wyatt,"Look, Donna and Joe are great."
Ben Wyatt,You all are great.
Ben Wyatt,And this wedding is gonna to be amazing.
Ben Wyatt,Let's get some music and dancing going.
Ben Wyatt,"And I am Ben Wyatt, and I very much approve this message!"
April Ludgate,You want me to shut that down?
Donna Meagle,"No, I like it."
Donna Meagle,Let the little man dance.
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,My head... Last night was so fun but my head... Died.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, mine's filled with concrete."
Leslie Knope,"Okay, so... Yesterday, you pretended you were going to run."
Leslie Knope,"Today, you're going to pretend like you're not going to run."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"Jen posted the campaign ad, it's everywhere."
Ben Wyatt,I'm running.
Ben Wyatt,"How could she do this to-- Oh, God, I'm remembering things."
Ben Wyatt,"We called Jen last night, didn't we?"
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, we did."
Ben Wyatt,Ugh.
Leslie Knope,I also called 867-5309 100 times.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,Bad.
Leslie Knope,What do we do?
Jennifer Barkley,There you are.
Jennifer Barkley,Surprise.
Jennifer Barkley,Surprise.
Jennifer Barkley,Whoa!
Jennifer Barkley,You guys should have corner boothed it because you look awful.
Jennifer Barkley,You're gonna scare off the other customers.
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jen."
Jennifer Barkley,All those kids keep you up all night?
Jennifer Barkley,So happy with my choices.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Jen."
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,I know I left you a message last night but I really do think you should have checked with me before throwing me into this.
Jennifer Barkley,No.
Jennifer Barkley,Ben.
Jennifer Barkley,"I'm sorry, you left me four messages last night."
Ben Wyatt,What?
Jennifer Barkley,And they contain very specific policy positions.
Ben Wyatt,"I want to come out strong on education, then I'll tack hard into fiscal responsibility."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Leslie Knope,8675309
Jennifer Barkley,I love that song.
Leslie Knope,"Jenny, I got your number-- Hey, babe, it's ringing!"
Leslie Knope,"Honey, you were a lot more lucid than I was."
Jennifer Barkley,Wait.
Jennifer Barkley,Were you guys drunk?
Jennifer Barkley,That is hilarious.
Leslie Knope,"No, we weren't--"
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, you guys are going to fit in so great in Washington."
Jennifer Barkley,Most of Congress is drunk all of the time.
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, official presser is tomorrow at 9:00."
Jennifer Barkley,"You could bail if you want, but it would be embarrassing."
Jennifer Barkley,Might derail your career.
Jennifer Barkley,Might not.
Jennifer Barkley,Probably will.
Jennifer Barkley,"Well, you never do know, though, right?"
Jennifer Barkley,"So, just let me know what you want to do."
Jennifer Barkley,Okay?
Jennifer Barkley,I'm just going to spend my time doing exactly what I want to do.
Jennifer Barkley,Because I don't have children.
Jennifer Barkley,"Bye, guys."
Extra,"Ron, I'm Walden with the Church's historical archives."
Extra,You called about wanting information on the building?
Ron Swanson,"I did, indeed."
Ron Swanson,Let's start with the facade.
Ron Swanson,Was the limestone locally hand-hewn?
Extra,No.
Extra,"In the late 1870s, it was actually cheaper to import limestone from Michigan."
Ron Swanson,Fascinating.
Ron Swanson,But tell me--
Lucy,I'll do whatever you want.
Lucy,I'm fine with whatever.
Tom Haverford,No.
Tom Haverford,Wherever you want.
Tom Haverford,No pressure.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Look at how beautiful you look.
Donna Meagle,"Leslie, I'm not even in my dress yet."
Leslie Knope,But you're going to be very soon.
Donna Meagle,"All right, I want to say something to my girls."
Donna Meagle,"Knope, you're a softie but on the inside you're a straight-up boss."
Donna Meagle,"April, you're the exact opposite."
Donna Meagle,You all inspire me and I love you.
Donna Meagle,"And you too, Michelle."
Donna Meagle,"Michelle, you were my best friend from childhood."
Donna Meagle,Until we lost touch because you thought your college boyfriend was into me.
Donna Meagle,He was.
Donna Meagle,I never gave him the time of day.
Donna Meagle,"But now, we're rebuilding our friendship."
Donna Meagle,Is this wedding going to be a test for you?
Donna Meagle,Yes.
Donna Meagle,"But the doctors once told you, you were never going to walk again, so... This should be easy, right?"
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,What a complicated tapestry that is.
Donna Meagle,"Bring it in, bring it in."
Craig Middlebrooks,Moment over.
Craig Middlebrooks,"Leslie, April, help Donna with her dress."
Typhoon,"Hi, I'm Typhoon."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Typhoon, I am interested, but now is not the time."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Michelle, get the bouquet."
Craig Middlebrooks,You're skating on very thin ice.
Ron Swanson,I couldn't help but notice from afar that you are both acting like weirdoes.
Ron Swanson,I further suspect you have not yet talked about what happened.
Tom Haverford,What?
Tom Haverford,"I don't even know what you're talking about, us having not talked about."
Ron Swanson,I only meant to say that there's no shame in declaring how you feel to a person you cherish.
Ron Swanson,I am sorry if I caused a problem because the two of you make a good team.
Ron Swanson,"If you'll excuse me, I missed out on the food, and was denied a fascinating conversation about Michigan limestone."
Ron Swanson,But I'll be damned if I don't properly honor the expression of romantic love.
Tom Haverford,Ron does this weird thing where he says exactly what he means.
Tom Haverford,You just have to ignore him.
Lucy,So you didn't mean what you said?
Tom Haverford," Look, I'm all in."
Tom Haverford, That's all I meant.
Tom Haverford," I didn't want you to think I was crazy or jumping the gun, and I know you just got out of a relationship so I don't expect you to feel the same way, but…"
Tom Haverford,That's how I feel.
Lucy," Well, I'm only dating you for the free dresses, so…"
Tom Haverford,I'm fine with that.
Joe, Donna.
Joe," Even though I've known you for years, I feel like I learn something new about you every day."
Joe," Just yesterday I learned that the Pearl Jam album, Vitalogy was written about you."
Joe," You are an amazing, confident woman."
Joe, And I love you.
Donna Meagle, I know that I can be a lot.
Donna Meagle, And awhile back I was thinking I'd never find someone who loved me for me.
Donna Meagle," But you're patient and kind and together, we can do anything."
Extra, You may now kiss the bride.
Leslie Knope," Hey, Roz."
Leslie Knope," Okay, we have the zebras."
Leslie Knope," Tell the kids not to worry, they're coming back home."
Leslie Knope," Also, we want to give you a raise."
Leslie Knope, And anything you want to take from our house.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Bye.
Ben Wyatt, How in the world am I supposed to run for office? Our lives are like one big unexpected stuffed zebra emergency.
Ben Wyatt," I don't know, what do you think I should do?"
Leslie Knope,"I told you, I'm neutral."
Ben Wyatt," Honey, you have never been neutral on anything in your life."
Ben Wyatt, You have an opinion on pockets.
Leslie Knope," Yes, I think they should all be bigger."
Leslie Knope," Okay, fine."
Leslie Knope, I think you should run.
Leslie Knope," Yes, our lives are bonkers but if something is worth it, and I think this is, then you just make it work."
Leslie Knope," Besides, I just read an article on two minute micro-naps and the science on them is very promising."
Reporter, Ben Wyatt.
Reporter, Any comment on the report that you're running for Congress?
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now."
Reporter, Your only experience in politics was as a failed mayor at age 18.
Ben Wyatt," Okay, please, everyone."
Ben Wyatt, We're at a wedding.
Ben Wyatt, And I'm holding zebras.
Reporter, I mean what qualifies you to take over Hartwell's seat?
Ben Wyatt,"Guys, listen to me, please."
Ben Wyatt," I'm dealing with an actual problem right now, okay? Which, by the way, is what I do for a living."
Ben Wyatt, I solve problems.
Ben Wyatt," As a budget specialist, and for five years as a City Manager and I'm pretty good at it."
Ben Wyatt," I have worked hard to transform this area into a fiscally sound destination for people who want good jobs and a good public education, and I think the results speak for themselves."
Ben Wyatt, My name is Ben Wyatt and I'm running for Congress.
Leslie Knope," My God, babe, that was so hot."
April Ludgate, Donna.
April Ludgate, Hey.
April Ludgate, How did I do?
Donna Meagle,Everything was perfect.
Donna Meagle, You are a miracle worker.
Donna Meagle," But I gotta say, I kind of miss the Meagle drama."
Donna Meagle, I thought for sure somebody was going to do something crazy.
Donna Meagle, But everybody is just nice and chill.
Donna Meagle," Anyway, I love you, and to thank you, I'm going to try not to hug you."
April Ludgate, Thank you.
Donna Meagle, I'm going to hug you.
April Ludgate, No!
Donna Meagle,"Okay, all right."
Donna Meagle," Wyatt, why didn't you tell us you were running for Congress?"
Ben Wyatt,"Well, we didn't want to steal your thunder."
Donna Meagle, Steal my thunder? I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle, Have you seen how I'm wearing this dress?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, in that case, yes, I am."
Joe, To Ben.
Ben Wyatt, To Donna and Joe.
Tom Haverford, To me.
Tom Haverford, I own my own restaurant and several other properties.
Tom Haverford, It's always worth celebrating.
April Ludgate, Who's Gary?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I think that's supposed to be me."
April Ludgate," That's your new name, Garry."
Andy Dwyer, Garry.
All, Garry! Garry! Garry! Garry! Garry!
Jerry Gergich,Garry is my real name.
Jerry Gergich," Yes, after 30 years, my co-workers are finally going to call me by my real name."
Jerry Gergich," Oh, boy, I'm blessed."
Craig Middlebrooks," Everyone, can I have your attention, please?"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Now, it's time for a surprise musical guest."
Craig Middlebrooks," One of my all-time favorites, me."
Craig Middlebrooks, I had a girl Donna was her name
Andy Dwyer,Donna!
Andy Dwyer, Joe!
Andy Dwyer,"I hope you saved a slice of that cake for your estranged brother, LeVondrious."
LeVondrious," What's up, girl? Didn't expect to see your baby bro at your wedding, huh? Well, I'm here."
LeVondrious, Despite what you did to me all those years ago.
Donna Meagle, What I did? This is because of what you did.
LeVondrious," Oh, you must be referring to the microwave incident."
Donna Meagle, Yeah.
LeVondrious, Don't worry.
LeVondrious, I brought it back.
LeVondrious, Now no one gets any popcorn.
April Ludgate, You said you wanted a little drama.
Donna Meagle," That's why I love you, girl."

Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, the central question that these senators are going to be asking is why should we invest in the National Park Service?"
Leslie Knope,April.
April Ludgate,"Well, it is simple, Leslie."
April Ludgate,"In today's fast-paced society, National Parks are still the best place for full moon werewolf transformations."
Leslie Knope,"I know you're kidding, but I also know that you're prepared, and we are going to do great."
Leslie Knope,How psyched are you about this trip?
Leslie Knope,"April, are you super psyched?"
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,"Also, you have lipstick on your teeth."
Leslie Knope,I do?
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Good looking out.
Leslie Knope,We're a great team.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I think I know what's going on in your head."
April Ludgate,Oh!
April Ludgate,"Well, then, welcome to the Terrordome."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,You need to tell Leslie that you want to leave your job.
April Ludgate,No.
April Ludgate,She freaks out when anything changes.
April Ludgate,"One time, Andy told her that I was getting rid of my bangs and she called 911."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I can't keep your secret much longer."
Ben Wyatt,"Any time your name comes up, I panic and change the subject to the Twin Peaks reboot until she gets bored."
April Ludgate,"So, you talk for one second?"
Ben Wyatt,You're going to spend the next couple of days with her.
Ben Wyatt,"If you talk to her directly and honestly, she can be surprisingly open minded."
April Ludgate,"Oh, really?"
April Ludgate,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
April Ludgate,Leslie?
April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking about changing the font on the itineraries. What do you think?"
Leslie Knope,What?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Leslie Knope,On what grounds?
Leslie Knope,Those-- those fonts are perfect.
Leslie Knope,It's readable and compact.
Leslie Knope,It's all on one page.
Leslie Knope,That's insane.
Leslie Knope,Don't mess with that.
Leslie Knope,"I appreciate your initiative, but itineraries are not the right place to mess around."
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"April, I told you that was an absurd idea."
April Ludgate,I don't care what Ben says.
April Ludgate,I'm not going to tell Leslie I'm leaving my job on this trip.
April Ludgate,She'll drown me in the Potomac while she recites facts about the Potomac.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, don't fret, cookie."
Andy Dwyer,"We've made progress, haven't we?"
Andy Dwyer,We've got a whole list of all the things you need out of a new job.
Andy Dwyer,"Apple juice, barbecue sauce, Count Chocula-- Wait."
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, sorry."
Andy Dwyer,That's the list of cool new nicknames I want people to call me.
Andy Dwyer,Here's your list.
April Ludgate,How can I tell her I'm leaving when I don't even know what job I want?
April Ludgate,Babe.
April Ludgate,I wish you were coming with me.
Andy Dwyer,I just decided what I'm going to do while April is out of town.
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to round up the team and find her a new job.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Ben Wyatt, please?"
Andy Dwyer,Tell him it's Count Chocula.
Andy Dwyer,"No, it's Andrew Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,I'm sorry.
Ron Swanson,"So, April wants to leave."
Ron Swanson,I always knew she would tire of government.
Ron Swanson,Took long enough.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, both me and Ben are trying to help April find a new job, and we thought maybe she could work for you."
Andy Dwyer,"I feel like it would be a perfect fit, although I don't know exactly what you guys do here."
Andy Dwyer,I'm guessing it's a business?
Andy Dwyer,Assassins?
Andy Dwyer,Hit men?
Andy Dwyer,Doctors.
Andy Dwyer,You guys are doctors?
Ron Swanson,We build things.
Ron Swanson,"Come on, let me show you around."
Ron Swanson,This is a door.
Ron Swanson,"These, of course, are walls."
Ron Swanson,What else?
Ron Swanson,What else?
Ron Swanson,Ah.
Ron Swanson,"Meet our vice president, Don Swanson."
Ron Swanson,"Don, this is Andrew and Benjamin."
Don Swanson,Pleasure to meet you.
Ben Wyatt,Is this your brother?
Ben Wyatt,You have a brother?
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,Fine.
Ron Swanson,"Yes, suppose the cat's out of the bag."
Ron Swanson,I have a brother.
Ron Swanson,One brother.
Andy Dwyer,"All those years together at the Parks Department, and you never told us you had a brother."
Don Swanson,You worked at the Parks Department?
Ron Swanson,Tour is over.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Carryon bags packed, trashy magazines purchased, boarding passes in hand, and we have 26 minutes for unstructured chat time."
Leslie Knope,What do you want to talk about?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,Nothing.
Leslie Knope,I thought maybe we could talk about your future.
Leslie Knope,You want to talk about your future?
April Ludgate,Yeah.
April Ludgate,I've actually been thinking about that a lot lately.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I figured."
Leslie Knope,It's hard at your age to figure out your path.
April Ludgate,I know.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I was going to surprise you with this in Washington, but what the heck."
Leslie Knope,It's unstructured chat time.
Leslie Knope,So Tada!
Leslie Knope,"This is your clear, definitive path through the federal government."
Leslie Knope,It starts here today with this flight and it goes all the way to 2022.
Leslie Knope,"Cool, right?"
April Ludgate,Wow!
April Ludgate,This is intense.
Leslie Knope,"I had to make some guesses about your ultimate government objectives and your fashion choices, etcetera."
Leslie Knope,"But the point is, with this, you don't have to worry."
April Ludgate,I know.
April Ludgate,I feel so relaxed.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
April Ludgate,What's up with these shirts?
Leslie Knope,Gov Buds for Life?
Leslie Knope,"Just a little fun I was having, you know?"
Leslie Knope,I didn't really make the shirts.
April Ludgate,"But did you, though?"
Leslie Knope,"Yes, I did."
Leslie Knope,Tada!
April Ludgate,"Oh, and also, I have a middle seat."
Leslie Knope,April!
Leslie Knope,Group One is boarding.
Andy Dwyer,Break it down.
Andy Dwyer,What will she be doing at this job?
Ron Swanson,"Well, she'd have about six people reporting to her."
Ron Swanson,"If she started soon, she could project manage our new warehouse in Snerling."
Ben Wyatt,"""Get to be my own boss."""
Ben Wyatt,"So far, so good."
Ben Wyatt,"She also wants ""passionate interest in subject matter."""
Ben Wyatt,"So, what kind of building is it?"
Ron Swanson,It's a largescale storage unit for surplus vinyl sheeting.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so, that's boring."
Andy Dwyer,"Would she have an opportunity to practice any ""creative problem solving""?"
Ron Swanson,Creativity is for people with glasses who like to lie.
Ron Swanson,"Although I suppose she could use ""creative"" ways to organize and stack the vinyl sheeting."
Ron Swanson,"No, that's insane."
Ron Swanson,We use the Towsend Method.
Ron Swanson,It's tried and true.
Ben Wyatt,I think this might be a dead end.
Ron Swanson,I think you might be right.
Ron Swanson,But getting a good person out of government is a worthwhile endeavor.
Ron Swanson,I will help.
Ron Swanson,"But first, I'm going to need some grub."
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,Let's grab some lunch and some ice cream and then maybe some after ice cream tacos.
Andy Dwyer,We'll just brainstorm.
Andy Dwyer,Maybe grab some snacks.
Ron Swanson,Vaughn.
Ron Swanson,Lon.
Vaughn Swanson,Ron.
Lon Swanson,Ron.
Randy,"Okay, I think we're all set."
Randy,"Even though I'm taking the lead on these meetings, don't be afraid to jump in."
Leslie Knope,Copy that.
Leslie Knope,"April, when Randy brings up the river project, that is your cue to…"
April Ludgate,Distract the guard so the Hamburglar can make his escape.
Randy,We're meeting with a lot of senators today.
Randy,Is she going to be okay?
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,It's just April.
Leslie Knope,Trust me.
April Ludgate,And we hope you agree that this is the best plan to preserve National Parks' funding into the next decade.
Barbara Boxer,"Well, so, Leslie, what do you think?"
Barbara Boxer,Is this the right move?
Leslie Knope,"Well, I think it's the only move, Senator Boxer."
Leslie Knope,I don't think this chance is going to come around again.
Barbara Boxer,"Well, you know, if it's good with Leslie, it's good with me."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I have another great idea."
Leslie Knope,"How about you and me, April, Randy, ""Historical Lampposts of D.C."" walking tour?"
Leslie Knope,Starts in 15 minutes.
Barbara Boxer,"Sounds great, but I do have an appointment with the President."
Leslie Knope,Can we come?
Andy Dwyer,What kind of a business is this?
Andy Dwyer,"Is it, like, hit man or astronauts?"
Ben Wyatt,It's an accounting firm.
Ben Wyatt,But they recently opened up a consulting wing.
Ben Wyatt,And consulting is perfect for April.
Ron Swanson,You think this Barney fellow will listen to what we have to say?
Barney,Ben!
Barney,Ben is here.
Barney,"Hi, Ben."
Barney,Ted!
Barney,Ben is here!
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"It is ""actuarily"" very good to see you guys."
Barney,Ben!
Ben Wyatt,They like me here.
Barney,You've got to hear this.
Randy,"So, we think we can keep costs down and still meet deadlines."
Kirsten Gillibrand,I have to say I'm really impressed with what you guys are doing over at Interior.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Senator Gillibrand."
Leslie Knope,We really appreciate your support.
Leslie Knope,Would you mind signing a copy of your book?
Kirsten Gillibrand,Of course.
Kirsten Gillibrand,Of course.
Leslie Knope,I took the liberty of writing the inscription.
Leslie Knope,All you have to do is sign.
Kirsten Gillibrand,"""To Leslie, my inspiration, my muse, my partner in crime."""
Kirsten Gillibrand,"""I owe it all to you."""
Leslie Knope,And there's room for a P.S. If you feel there's more you left out.
Kirsten Gillibrand,"Well, I think I've said all I want to say right here."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Kirsten Gillibrand,Okay.
John McCain,"Yeah, but I can't do that right now."
John McCain,"Oh, boy."
John McCain,I'll call you back.
Leslie Knope,"Hello, Senator."
Leslie Knope,Do you have a minute to chat?
John McCain,"Well, I can't right now."
John McCain,I've got a meeting.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you Actually, I checked with your staff, and they said that you have a free half hour."
John McCain,Did anyone ever tell you that your tenacity can be intimidating?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,Every month of my life since fourth grade.
Leslie Knope,"Now, let's talk about National Parks."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I just have to say I'm very surprised that the two of you are seeing eye to eye on this one."
Orrin Hatch,"Well, Senator Booker and I are both concerned about our nation's resources, and that absolutely includes our National Parks."
Cory Booker,But that's not all we have in common.
Cory Booker,"In fact, our real passion is Polynesian folk music."
Orrin Hatch,Polynesian folk music.
Leslie Knope,What?
Orrin Hatch,Polynesian folk music.
Orrin Hatch,Our band is playing in Georgetown tonight if you'd like to come.
Orrin Hatch,"We're called ""Across the Isle."""
Cory Booker,Did you get that?
Cory Booker,"""Isle""?"
Cory Booker,"""Isle"" like an island and then ""across the aisle""?"
Cory Booker,"The political ""aisle""?"
Cory Booker,"It's, like, a pun."
Cory Booker,It's a play on words.
Leslie Knope,I do get it.
April Ludgate,We are definitely coming to this.
Orrin Hatch,It's 8 dollars if you buy your tickets now.
Orrin Hatch,It's 10 dollars at the door.
Cory Booker,A fiscal conservative.
Cory Booker,Love this guy.
Cory Booker,Love this guy.
Orrin Hatch,Yeah.
Ron Swanson,April Ludgate-Dwyer.
Ron Swanson,She worked on the Gryzzl deal that you guys did the finances for.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, I know that you're opening up a consulting wing, and I just think that April would be a great hire."
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, and here's the thing, Barney."
Andy Dwyer,We're obviously very familiar with what consulting is.
Andy Dwyer,But why don't you go ahead and tell my friends here.
Andy Dwyer,Because I don't think that they know.
Barney,"Well, it's really about finding creative solutions to difficult problems."
Barney,"Now, a lot of times, there's firing."
Barney,"So, consultants aren't exactly well liked."
Andy Dwyer,Holy crap.
Andy Dwyer,"This is the job for her, I can feel it."
Andy Dwyer,She'll take it.
Andy Dwyer,"Now, let's talk perks."
Andy Dwyer,Does she get the summer off?
Andy Dwyer,Is it like school?
Ron Swanson,Son.
Ron Swanson,Easy.
Barney,"Well, what did she major in?"
Barney,Economics?
Barney,Accounting?
Andy Dwyer,"She designed her own major, Halloween Studies."
Ben Wyatt,"Trust me, Barney."
Ben Wyatt,She's brilliant and a very fast learner.
Ben Wyatt,Does that compound your interest?
Ben Wyatt,Huh?
Ben Wyatt,What do you say?
Ben Wyatt,"Huh, Barney?"
Barney,"Ben, that was amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Barney,But it's too late for her to apply.
Barney,"I'm sorry, but we're not really taking any more applicants."
Barney,Though I could make an exception for someone else.
Andy Dwyer,Not interested.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, five yeses and four noes."
Leslie Knope,Not a bad start.
Randy,"So, Leslie, I was going to talk to you about this in a few weeks, but Mike Norbert is retiring."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,Old Norbs is stepping down.
Leslie Knope,"Couldn't handle the pressure, huh?"
Leslie Knope,What a wuss.
Randy,His marriage is falling apart.
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, okay."
Randy,She had an affair with his best friend.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,I feel bad about what I said before.
Randy,Yeah.
Randy,I get it.
Randy,I get it.
Randy,"So, anyway."
Randy,"Good news for you is, we'd like to promote you to Deputy Director of Operations at Interior."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Randy,"You'd have to move to D.C., , and you'd have to complete the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program."
Leslie Knope,I have to enroll in SESCDP?
Leslie Knope,Forty four weeks of intensive courses and notetaking?
Leslie Knope,"Um, it's a dream come true."
Randy,"And I have to warn you, there will be a confirmation hearing."
Leslie Knope,A confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,A freaking confirmation hearing?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me a second.
Leslie Knope,What's that?
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,"To the best of my recollection, yes, I accept the job."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Excuse me, ma'am."
Leslie Knope,Do you mind if I borrow your hat?
Leslie Knope,I just want to throw it up in the air victoriously.
Extra,No.
Leslie Knope,Ma'am?
Ben Wyatt,I think that job is perfect for April.
Ben Wyatt,We just have to convince Barney to give her a shot.
Ben Wyatt,"First problem, she's not as qualified as the other applicants."
Andy Dwyer,Simple solution?
Andy Dwyer,I break into her college and I change her degree to accounting.
Andy Dwyer,Easy.
Andy Dwyer,"On my way out, look up at the blackboard."
Andy Dwyer,What is that?
Andy Dwyer,Impossible math equation?
Andy Dwyer,I solve it.
Andy Dwyer,"X equals Y, obviously."
Andy Dwyer,"Professor comes up to me, he says, ""I've been working on that for 50 years."""
Andy Dwyer,"""Why don't you accept this math trophy?"""
Andy Dwyer,"By the time he turns around, I'm gone."
Ron Swanson,We need to highlight April's strengths.
Ron Swanson,I thought we could update her resume.
Ron Swanson,This is the one she applied to Parks with.
Ron Swanson,It's just a signed photograph of a puppet named Alf.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, so we make her an actual resume, then put on a big presentation, show Barney that she's more than qualified."
Ben Wyatt,We're going to need all hands on deck.
Ben Wyatt,"That's Craig, Donna, and most importantly--"
Ron Swanson,"Please, no."
Andy Dwyer,Come on.
Andy Dwyer,Don't do it.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,You want to photocopy?
Ben Wyatt,You guys want to do all the mindless work?
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I didn't think so."
Ben Wyatt,Get me Garry Gergich.
Leslie Knope,"Look around, April."
Leslie Knope,What do you see?
April Ludgate,Fountains.
April Ludgate,Water.
April Ludgate,Sky.
April Ludgate,You.
April Ludgate,Looking at me like a crazy person.
Leslie Knope,I see a new home.
Leslie Knope,"I am going to take that job, Ben's going to run for Congress, he will win eventually, and then we're going to split our time between Washington and Pawnee."
April Ludgate,That's great.
April Ludgate,It looks like everything is falling into place for you.
Leslie Knope,"For us, April."
Leslie Knope,For us.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,Whoa!
April Ludgate,What is that over there?
April Ludgate,A lamppost?
April Ludgate,"Is that historic, do you think?"
Leslie Knope,"No, they put that in in the '70s."
Leslie Knope,"Look, I am so ahead of my five year plan."
Leslie Knope,Which means that you're going to need a new five year plan.
Leslie Knope,And here it is.
April Ludgate,"Ow, it's hot."
April Ludgate,How did you make this so fast?
Leslie Knope,I keep a local bindermaker on retainer in D.C.
Leslie Knope,We are about to embark on such an amazing journey.
Leslie Knope,"This is going to be our city, and this is going to be our bench."
Leslie Knope,"April, we have a bench in D.C."
April Ludgate,"I'm sorry, Leslie."
April Ludgate,I can't do this anymore.
April Ludgate,I don't want to work in government.
April Ludgate,I quit.
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,You quit?
Leslie Knope,Why?
April Ludgate,"Because honestly, I don't even know if I like working in National Parks."
April Ludgate,Or government.
April Ludgate,"I just fell backwards into your world, and years have gone by."
April Ludgate,"And now, I'm here."
April Ludgate,And Andy and Ben have been helping me look into different jobs to figure out what I really want to do.
Leslie Knope,Ben who?
Leslie Knope,Ben Wyatt?
Leslie Knope,He's been helping you behind my back?
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, you know what?"
Leslie Knope,We had a good run.
Leslie Knope,But he's dead to me now.
April Ludgate,"It's just, I've been on this weird path my entire adult life, and I need to figure out what I really want."
Leslie Knope,I cannot believe you're quitting.
Leslie Knope,And I cannot believe this is the first time I'm hearing it.
Leslie Knope,"And on our bench, of all places."
Leslie Knope,It's just so frustrating.
Leslie Knope,"I love her, but you spend so much time and effort on someone's life and she's just going to quit on me?"
Leslie Knope,"It's like, what's the point, you know?"
Madeleine Albright,"Wow, Leslie."
Madeleine Albright,I haven't seen you this upset since you almost forgot Ann's half birthday.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Madeleine Albright,Tell me.
Madeleine Albright,How many times have we had lunch?
Leslie Knope,Five.
Leslie Knope,"Well, eight if you count all those times I showed up unannounced at your office with mini muffins."
Madeleine Albright,And why have we had lunch so many times?
Leslie Knope,"Well, because when I knew I would be coming to Washington to work, I wore you down until you agreed to become my friend."
Madeleine Albright,"I'm so glad that you did, and you are a wonderful friend."
Madeleine Albright,"But sometimes, you're so focused and driven that you forget about people's feelings."
Leslie Knope,Name one time I've done that.
Madeleine Albright,"Well, you were so wrapped up in your story that you actually ate my waffle."
Madeleine Albright,"Sometimes, all you can do is give people a little bit of advice and a push."
Madeleine Albright,But you have to realize April has to be able to make up her own mind.
Leslie Knope,"You're right, once again, Madeleine Albright."
Madeleine Albright,Can I have my pin back now?
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah, sorry."
Leslie Knope,Thank you for letting me wear it.
Leslie Knope,It just makes me feel very powerful.
Madeleine Albright,"Me, too."
Craig Middlebrooks,Resume's done.
Craig Middlebrooks,"I used bullet points instead of numbers, because I find it conveys strength and competence."
Donna Meagle,A binder of her accomplishments.
Donna Meagle,Photos of her getting the job done.
Donna Meagle,"And 500 dollars cash, in case you want to go the straightup bribe route."
Ben Wyatt,Donna.
Donna Meagle,"You put me on the team, I find a way to win."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,Copies are made.
Jerry Gergich,"Everything has been collated and stapled, and all the research has been doublechecked."
Jerry Gergich,I went through quite a few staples.
Craig Middlebrooks,I added a personal testimony vouching for April's brilliance.
Craig Middlebrooks,"And this guy better appreciate it, because I do not compare people to Mary J. Blige lightly."
Donna Meagle,"Uh, no one should."
Craig Middlebrooks,Do you want to go to dinner tonight?
Donna Meagle,I do not.
Craig Middlebrooks,Respect.
Jerry Gergich,I'm free.
Craig Middlebrooks,I have plans.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, great job, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"With all this, Barney will at least have to give her a shot."
Andy Dwyer,"Sure, they did a good job, but this isn't enough."
Andy Dwyer,I've been thinking about it all day.
Andy Dwyer,And I have a plan to go the extra mile and make April seem like the ideal candidate.
Andy Dwyer,Give me the job!
Andy Dwyer,"My name's April Ludgate, and my talent is explosive."
Andy Dwyer,Go USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer,USA!
Andy Dwyer, USA!
Andy Dwyer, When should I tell April to show up?
Barney, My car.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Thank you for coming.
April Ludgate," Yeah, well, I had to miss the ""Memorable Rain Gutters of Washington"" walking tour, so this better be good."
Leslie Knope, I'm sorry I blew up at you yesterday.
Leslie Knope," I really want all of my friends to be happy together, but more importantly, I just want them to be happy."
Leslie Knope," If you feel like you need to move on, I totally get it."
April Ludgate," Okay, turn around."
Leslie Knope, What? Why?
April Ludgate,Because I'm about to say something serious and I can't do it if I have to look you in the eye.
April Ludgate, Please.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
April Ludgate," Now, take your shoes off and wear them like mittens."
Leslie Knope, April.
April Ludgate," Okay, sorry."
April Ludgate," When I started working for you, I was aimless and just thought everything was stupid and lame."
April Ludgate, And you turned me into someone with goals and ambition.
April Ludgate, Which is really the only reason why I'm even thinking about what I really want.
April Ludgate, And I just want to say thank you.
April Ludgate, And I love you very much.
April Ludgate, Which is why I have decided not to turn you into a sea urchin.
April Ludgate, Which I could do because I am an actual witch with powers and I'm evil--
Leslie Knope,I know.
April Ludgate, And I hate everything.
Leslie Knope, I know you do.
Leslie Knope, I know.
Leslie Knope," Thank you, April."
Leslie Knope," So, you don't have any idea what you want to do?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, here's the good news."
Leslie Knope, I am on the case.
Leslie Knope, I know some people who might be able to help us.
Leslie Knope, Come on.
Leslie Knope," April, this is Alyssa, from the American Service Foundation."
Leslie Knope," They take young people like you who are trying to explore a new path, and match them with one of the thousands of jobs across America that help communities."
Leslie Knope," Alyssa, this is April Ludgate, the single greatest human being ever, and you need to find her a job that she will love and cherish and make her life feel complete."
April Ludgate," Okay, I'm sorry."
April Ludgate, I found this crazy woman on the street and she won't leave me alone.
Alyssa," Oh, I'm very familiar with Leslie's enthusiasm."
Leslie Knope, They contacted us last year because they wanted to place some people in National Parks.
Alyssa," Two days later, we had set up the entire program, and she sent me a throw pillow with my face stitched onto it."
Leslie Knope, Not my best work.
Leslie Knope," Plus, you changed your hair."
Leslie Knope, I'm going to send you another one.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Go solve all of your career problems.
Leslie Knope, I'll wait right here.
April Ludgate, Sorry.
Leslie Knope, That a girl.
April Ludgate, Ugh! Mom.
Leslie Knope," I don't know, Madeleine."
Leslie Knope," They're taking forever, and I'm starting to lose it."
Leslie Knope," Talk to me, okay? Your voice makes me calm."
Leslie Knope, Tell me another Yeltsin story.
Leslie Knope," Okay, she's here."
Leslie Knope, I have to go.
Leslie Knope, Bye.
Leslie Knope, Say hi to your daughters.
Leslie Knope, Hey.
Leslie Knope, Hi.
Leslie Knope, How did it go?
April Ludgate,I'm great.
April Ludgate, I know exactly what I want to do.
Leslie Knope, Yes.
Leslie Knope, Is it Teach for America? No.
Leslie Knope, Habitat for Humanity? No.
Leslie Knope, It's working with animals.
Leslie Knope, No.
April Ludgate, I want to work here.
April Ludgate, At the Foundation.
April Ludgate, I want to be like Alyssa.
April Ludgate," I want to tell people what to do, and then send them far away from me."
April Ludgate, It's perfect.
April Ludgate, And it hits everything on my list.
April Ludgate," Creative problem solving, working one-on-one--"
Leslie Knope,"I am 100,000% in support of this idea."
Leslie Knope, This is an amazing idea.
Leslie Knope, I love this idea.
Leslie Knope, And I love you.
Leslie Knope," So, are they hiring? What did Alyssa say when you told her?"
April Ludgate,Nothing.
April Ludgate, I didn't tell her yet.
April Ludgate, I wanted to see if you thought it was a good idea first.
April Ludgate, What? Bad idea?
Leslie Knope,You wanted to run something by me?
April Ludgate,Oh My God.
April Ludgate, Yes.
April Ludgate," So, will you help me?"
Leslie Knope,"April, you don't need me."
Leslie Knope, You can get any job you want all by yourself.
Leslie Knope," Obviously, I'm going to vet your resume and we'll hold some mock-interviews and I'll choose your outfit and everything."
Leslie Knope, But you can get this sucker on your own.
Andy Dwyer," So, long story short, we might have found you the perfect job."
Andy Dwyer," But also, I might have blown it."
Andy Dwyer, Ben and Ron are there now to try to fix it.
Andy Dwyer," And if they don't, I feel like it's kind of on them."
April Ludgate, Everyone is being so nice to me lately.
April Ludgate, It's weird.
April Ludgate, I feel like I need to take a shower in pig's blood to wash all the niceness off me.
Andy Dwyer, It's because we love you.
Andy Dwyer, We want you to be happy.
Andy Dwyer, This consulting job could be the answer.
April Ludgate, Yeah.
April Ludgate," So, about that--"
Ron Swanson,Please don't hold anything Andy did against April.
Ron Swanson," She is an exceptional human being, who married a well meaning goofball."
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, and I think that presentation we put together says it all."
Ron Swanson," All we're asking is that you meet with her, and seriously consider her for the job."
Ben Wyatt," And if she disappoints you, you can hold me accountable…. Right?"
Barney,"You know what? If her friends are trying this hard, there must be something amazing about her."
Barney, Tell her I'll meet with her tomorrow--
Ben Wyatt,Hold on.
Ben Wyatt, April? Hey.
Ben Wyatt, We were just talking about you.
Ben Wyatt, We've got some good news.
Ben Wyatt," Oh, boy."
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt, She doesn't want the job.
Barney, I see.
Ron Swanson," Well, this is uncomfortable."

,Season: 7 Episode: 09
Jennifer Barkley,We need to go over the schedule leading up to the primary.
Jennifer Barkley,Let's talk shop.
Leslie Knope,"Ooh, shop talk."
Leslie Knope,"One of my five favorite types of talk, along with pillow, girl, real, and TED."
Ben Wyatt,Why are you wearing a poncho?
Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, because every surface area in your house is sticky."
Jennifer Barkley,"Last time I was here, I found a melted crayon on my blazer."
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,I have a photo op with Gryzzl tomorrow.
Ben Wyatt,Between now and then we have a ton of stuff scheduled.
Ben Wyatt,Looks like we're gonna have to skip the pie baking event and the ceremonial squash toss.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"
Leslie Knope,We have to skip that?
Leslie Knope,I love watching those squashes fly through the air.
Ben Wyatt,I kind of like the way they land.
Leslie Knope,"Me, too."
Jennifer Barkley,"Okay, excuse me, but I have to get back to a city, where things happen."
Jennifer Barkley,Okay.
Jennifer Barkley,This campaign is about to start in earnest.
Jennifer Barkley,Things are about to get real intense.
Jennifer Barkley,"Leslie, you ready?"
Leslie Knope,"Me, Leslie?"
Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I was an actual candidate, so I think I can handle being a candidate's wife."
Leslie Knope,I know all the issues inside and out.
Jennifer Barkley,"Mmm, see, that's the problem."
Jennifer Barkley,Being the wife of is a minefield.
Jennifer Barkley,"If you were just a dingdong, I would just slap a flag pin on you, and pour some Valium down your throat, and just shove you behind the podium way upstage."
Jennifer Barkley,It's the smarties that freak people out.
Leslie Knope,I think you're underestimating the voters.
Jennifer Barkley,I don't think that is possible.
Leslie Knope,"Stephen, be careful."
Jennifer Barkley,Poncho!
April Ludgate,"I know you normally hate foundations, but this one I think you'll actually like."
April Ludgate,We take people that don't know what they wanna do and then put them to work doing cool stuff all over the world.
April Ludgate,And I start in a couple months.
Ron Swanson,"Well, I had hoped you'd choose a more dignified trade like masonry or logging."
Ron Swanson,"But you are out of local government, and that's a step in the right direction."
April Ludgate,It's definitely the job I wanted.
April Ludgate,But it means that we have to move to Washington.
Ron Swanson,Well.
Ron Swanson,Then bully for you.
Ron Swanson,"If you intend to move, I suppose you should return the spare key to my house."
Ron Swanson,"The one I gave you years ago when you were my assistant, for emergencies."
April Ludgate,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Good talk.
Ben Wyatt,This neighborhood has been mostly abandoned for years.
Ben Wyatt,"But now, thanks to the new Gryzzl headquarters, this district will soon transform into a hub of innovation for decades to come."
Reporter,Mister Wyatt.
Reporter,Your campaign released a schedule.
Reporter,And it looks like your wife is skipping the Pie Mary.
Reporter,Care to explain?
Leslie Knope,"The Pie Mary is a Southern Indiana tradition, where Congressional candidates' wives face off in a pie baking contest."
Leslie Knope,The last contest's winner was June Hartwell's buttermilk meringue.
Leslie Knope,Last contest's loser was all women.
Reporter,Leslie would be the first candidate's wife not to enter the Pie Mary.
Reporter,What kind of a statement are you making by skipping it?
Leslie Knope,We're-- I'm not making any kind of statement.
Leslie Knope,"We're just focusing on bigger issues, like Ben's 150 million dollar revitalization project."
Mike Patterson,Pardon me.
Mike Patterson,I need to get through.
Mike Patterson,Pardon me.
Mike Patterson,Excuse me.
Mike Patterson,Mike Patterson here.
Mike Patterson,"Leslie, you made it pretty clear that you don't think homemaking is important."
Mike Patterson,Do you ever cook for your children?
Mike Patterson,And who's even watching your children right now while you're out God only knows where?
Leslie Knope,What are you talking about?
Leslie Knope,I'm standing right here in front of you.
Mike Patterson,"Okay, take it easy."
Mike Patterson,Let's not get emotional.
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, we have to run."
Ben Wyatt,We'll see you all at my economic address.
Ben Wyatt,"Thanks for coming, everybody."
Mike Patterson,"What other traditions are you against, Leslie?"
Mike Patterson,Baseball?
Mike Patterson,Hugging your children?
Mike Patterson,How much did that haircut cost?
Leslie Knope,None of your business.
Leslie Knope,And thank you for noticing.
Andy Dwyer,My desk was right here.
Andy Dwyer,Sitting right on top of it this whole time.
Andy Dwyer,How much money is it?
April Ludgate,It's not money.
April Ludgate,I told you.
April Ludgate,It's Ron's key.
April Ludgate,I hid it in here years ago.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,No key.
Andy Dwyer,Just a note and a movie ticket stub and four teeth.
April Ludgate,"""If you are looking for Ron's key, I moved it, and you'll never find it."""
April Ludgate,"""Cordially, April."""
Andy Dwyer,Where'd you put it then?
April Ludgate,I don't know.
April Ludgate,It was eight years ago.
April Ludgate,"Oh, God."
April Ludgate,A key to Ron's house is lost in a government building.
April Ludgate,It's his worst nightmare.
Andy Dwyer,"Listen, babe."
Andy Dwyer,All we gotta do is train Champion to sniff out Ron's key.
April Ludgate,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,All we need is Ron's key to give him a scent.
Andy Dwyer,So give me the key and I'll get you that key.
Mike Patterson,Welcome back to the program.
Mike Patterson,"My guest is June Hartwell, wife of incumbent Congressman Paul Hartwell."
Mike Patterson,"Now, June, we all know what Ben Wyatt's wife is really saying."
Mike Patterson,"By skipping the Pie Mary, she's saying, ""Women who love their families are stupid."""
June Hartwell,"Mike, we all make certain choices."
June Hartwell,Ms. Knope chose to try to have it all.
June Hartwell,I chose to put my family first.
Mike Patterson,"Oh, I'm just speculating here, but do you think that Leslie Knope's actions indicate that she actually hates her family?"
Leslie Knope,"Well, it only took three hours for Jen to be right."
Leslie Knope,I'm officially a distraction.
Leslie Knope,I'm gonna enter that Pie Mary.
Ben Wyatt,"This is just nonsense, it'll blow over."
Ben Wyatt,And the Pie Mary is ridiculous and antiquated.
Leslie Knope,"But the more they talk about this, the less they're gonna talk about your economic plan."
Leslie Knope,"Besides, I'm good at making pies, so I'll win and then I can promote my self-published women's rights barbecue cookbook The Feminine Mesquite."
Leslie Knope,Everything's fine.
April Ludgate,"I had it in a safe place, and then I moved it to protect it, and I don't remember where."
Ron Swanson,I see.
Andy Dwyer,"Don't be mad, Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"She hid it too good, and she left a string of clues."
Ron Swanson,It's an impossible puzzle.
Ron Swanson,And I love puzzles.
Ron Swanson,"A minimal, unhelpful note, these appear to be human teeth."
Ron Swanson,And what is this?
Ron Swanson,Twilight: New Moon?
April Ludgate,"It's a movie, but I've never seen it."
April Ludgate,"It's, like, about lame werewolves and vampires and stuff."
Ron Swanson,Donna likes those things.
Ron Swanson,Dollars to donuts this points us her way.
Ron Swanson,"Finally, a scavenger hunt worthy of my time."
Ron Swanson,Onward!
Leslie Knope,"Okay, snacks given, kids tucked in, books read, three simultaneous meltdowns for no reason, kids tucked back in, one of them briefly got outside somehow, kids back in bed, they're all napping."
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,I got everything you need for pie domination.
Ben Wyatt,"I even got an extra whipped cream can, one for baking, one for directly into mouth."
Leslie Knope,You know me so well.
Leslie Knope,That might be one of the kids.
Elise Yarktin,"Hi, Leslie."
Elise Yarktin,"Elise Yarktin, from the Indiana Organization of Women."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my goodness, Elise."
Leslie Knope,"Please, come in."
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,Are you here to give me the Woman of the Year award?
Leslie Knope,I have a speech prepared.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see it?
Leslie Knope,Right now?
Elise Yarktin,No.
Elise Yarktin,"Leslie, we were thrilled to find out you were boycotting that ridiculous Pie Mary."
Elise Yarktin,But we just got word you've decided to enter?
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, well, I agree that it's dumb."
Leslie Knope,"But this is not about me, it's about Ben, and he will do more for women than Hartwell."
Leslie Knope,"So, you know, lose a battle, win the war."
Leslie Knope,That kind of thing.
Leslie Knope,It's the way to go.
Elise Yarktin,Look.
Elise Yarktin,"The Pie Mary is retrogressive and misogynistic, and if you participate, we will have no choice but to protest you and Ben at the event."
Elise Yarktin,Hope you like pies... In your face.
Elise Yarktin,Metaphorically.
Elise Yarktin,We'll be civil.
Leslie Knope,Elise.
Leslie Knope,There is no bigger defender of gender equality than Leslie Knope.
Leslie Knope,"And my husband, Ben, is a progressive champion of women's rights."
Ben Wyatt,"Babe, the oven's ready."
Ben Wyatt,"Chop chop, time to get bakin'."
Ben Wyatt,Daddy want pie.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Ben Wyatt."
Ron Swanson,We have a wonderfully small number of clues.
Ron Swanson,One is this ticket.
Ron Swanson,Did you see this movie about vampires and such?
Donna Meagle,New Moon?
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, I saw it with April."
Donna Meagle,"She was so hopped up on painkillers from getting her wisdom teeth out, I convinced her to see it with me."
Ron Swanson,The teeth.
Ron Swanson,They're yours.
Donna Meagle,You were super out of it.
Donna Meagle,"You kept yelling ""Team Voldemort!"""
Donna Meagle,At the screen and we were kicked out.
Donna Meagle,I was furious.
Donna Meagle,You only get to see the second Twilight  film for the seventh time once.
Ron Swanson,Do you remember anything about a key?
Ron Swanson,Or April doing anything unusual that day?
Donna Meagle,She did make us stop by the shoeshine stand before we left because she wanted to drop something off for Andy.
Donna Meagle,She had a real bad crush on him.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Babe.
Andy Dwyer,You had a crush on me.
Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.
April Ludgate,We're married.
Andy Dwyer,Still.
Ron Swanson,To the shoeshine stand!
Andy Dwyer,Ooh!
Andy Dwyer,Chase me.
April Ludgate,Stop.
Donna Meagle,Garry?
Donna Meagle,What the hell are you doing?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, gosh."
Jerry Gergich,"Well, I dropped my wedding ring down this grate, and then I was trying to get it out and I dropped my keys down there too, So I can't leave."
Donna Meagle,"Damn, this takes me back."
Donna Meagle,Mind if I stay and watch?
Jerry Gergich,Not at all.
Jerry Gergich,I appreciate the company.
Leslie Knope,The IOW does not mess around.
Leslie Knope,"Which normally is why I love them, but now I'm on the other side."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, Ben, I gave them 100 dollars in their annual pledge."
Leslie Knope,Do you know how many anti-me signs that could buy?
Ben Wyatt,"You just don't do the pie contest, obviously."
Leslie Knope,Then we're just back where we started.
Leslie Knope,Then it just seems like I'm saying I'm better than the women who bake.
Leslie Knope,What should we do?
Leslie Knope,Should we get a divorce?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, how about this?"
Ben Wyatt,What if I register for the contest?
Ben Wyatt,I bake the pie.
Ben Wyatt,I act as my own wife.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, that could work."
Leslie Knope,"We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate."
Leslie Knope,And then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.
Ben Wyatt,Exactly.
Ben Wyatt,"But more importantly, we change the idea of what a pie is."
Leslie Knope,"I feel like that's not more important, but I like the energy that we have, so let's hear it."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, picture this... Crust on the bottom."
Ben Wyatt,Filling.
Ben Wyatt,Crust on top.
Ben Wyatt,What am I describing?
Leslie Knope,A pie.
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt,"But you're in the right ""zone."""
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,Calzone!
Leslie Knope,Sure!
Ben Wyatt,"Pies are just sweet calzones, honey."
Ben Wyatt,And I'm good at making calzones.
Leslie Knope,You're amazing.
Ben Wyatt,I can win this thing.
Leslie Knope,"Of course you can, baby."
Leslie Knope,Get in there and start baking.
Donna Meagle,I'm having some serious deja vu.
Donna Meagle,How many times have you lost your wedding ring?
Jerry Gergich,Too many times to count.
Jerry Gergich,And it causes real trouble with Gayle.
Jerry Gergich,"And any time I lose my ring, she turns into a real grumpy goose."
Donna Meagle,Is that so?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, yeah."
Jerry Gergich,"She'll say, you know, ""Garry, you'd lose your head if it wasn't screwed on tight."""
Jerry Gergich,And then she makes me go for the fresh oranges for the morning OJ.
Jerry Gergich,"And she says, ""Hey, Mr. Forgetful."""
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, those words... They rattle around here for hours."
Jerry Gergich,"That's why I've gotta be extra careful with this replacement ring, because if I lost--"
Donna Meagle,I'm gonna order us some dinner.
Andy Dwyer,The shoeshine stand is gone.
Andy Dwyer,Or maybe it was never here.
Ron Swanson,They must have moved it during the remodel.
Ron Swanson,It's probably in basement storage.
Ron Swanson,To the basement!
Harris,Tighter.
Brett,"You sure, dude?"
Harris,"Yeah, dude."
Harris,Tighter.
Harris,I can do it.
Ron Swanson,"Do what, exactly?"
Harris,Nothing.
Harris,We're not doing anything.
Brett,And we definitely do not live down here now.
April Ludgate,"Guys, where's the old shoeshine stand from upstairs?"
Brett,We don't know anything about that.
Ron Swanson,"Boys, think."
Ron Swanson,We are on a quest and we are not leaving until we get an answer.
Harris,"Well, we're on our own quest, which is to squeeze this just tight enough to make my eyes bulge out a little bit, but not so tight that I die."
Andy Dwyer,I've been there.
Andy Dwyer,That's a real tightrope walk.
Brett,Oh!
Brett,Hey!
Brett,Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.
Brett,"It had black hair, but you could see through his skin."
Brett,"It didn't like me, but that's just 'cause I got a soul of a Ghostbuster."
Harris,"Yeah, it said something about how it was worried Brett was gonna mug it."
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,So we're looking for a racist ghost with black hair who likes shoeshines.
Ron Swanson,I think I have the answer.
Ron Swanson,The chase continues!
Donna Meagle,"Okay, wait."
Donna Meagle,"At the time that you told us you were mugged in the park, what were you reaching for in the river?"
Jerry Gergich,A burrito.
Donna Meagle,That's right.
Donna Meagle,You fell in the river reaching for a burrito.
Jerry Gergich,"Yes, ma'am."
Jerry Gergich,That was not one of my finer moments.
Donna Meagle,Ooh.
Donna Meagle,It's getting late.
Donna Meagle,We need to bounce.
Donna Meagle,I can give you a ride.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, thank you, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,Probably gonna get an earful when I get home tonight.
Jerry Gergich,Gayle might even call me the B word.
Jerry Gergich,"""Bozo."""
Donna Meagle,Wow.
Donna Meagle,We are very different people.
Ben Wyatt,Did you hear back from Elise?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."
Leslie Knope,We're good.
Leslie Knope,The IOW is not gonna protest us.
Leslie Knope,How's your pie?
Ben Wyatt,I don't know.
Ben Wyatt,I didn't make a pie.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How is your dessert calzone?
Ben Wyatt,It's ready.
Ben Wyatt,"The question is, are they?"
Extra,"All right, our next contestant Is candidate Ben Wyatt's wife, Leslie."
Extra,"Let's see what Mrs. Wyatt has baked up for us, shall we?"
Ben Wyatt,It's actually Ms. Knope.
Ben Wyatt,"And actually, right now it's Mr. Wyatt."
Ben Wyatt,"Leslie has her own busy life and I happen to be an excellent pie maker, so we figured we'd switch it up a bit."
Ben Wyatt,"Now, pack your suitcases, because we're going to a little town, Called Napoli In Italy."
All,Free Ben Wyatt!
All,Free Ben Wyatt!
All,Free Ben Wyatt!
Ben Wyatt,"Excuse me, free me from what?"
Kipp Bunthart,From the tyranny of women.
Kipp Bunthart,We are the Male Men.
Kipp Bunthart,"We are a men's rights activist group, and we are fed up."
Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.
Leslie Knope,What's happening now?
Kipp Bunthart,Behind every successful woman is a man she has oppressed.
Kipp Bunthart,First Leslie Knope poaches her husband's campaign by making it all about her.
Kipp Bunthart,Now she's forcing him to bake pies and enter a contest for her?
Leslie Knope,Excuse me!
Leslie Knope,I'm not forcing him to do anything!
Leslie Knope,He loves to cook.
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,He has five personalized aprons.
Kipp Bunthart,Oh.
Kipp Bunthart,So I guess he was asking for it because of the way he was dressed?
Kipp Bunthart,We are sick and tired of this feminized society.
Kipp Bunthart,"Men have had a very rough go of it, for Just recently."
Kipp Bunthart,And it ends now.
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!
Kipp Bunthart,Male and proud!
Marcia Langman,Leslie Knope exemplifies the feminist attack on our values.
Marcia Langman,"She could learn a little something about traditional family structure from me and my husband, Marshall."
Marshall Langman,Um.
Marshall Langman,Fierce alert.
Marshall Langman,"Eat 'em up, honey."
Elise Yarktin,The idea that feminism is an attack on family values is absurd.
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh.
Joan Callamezzo,So you're defending Leslie Knope?
Elise Yarktin,No.
Elise Yarktin,Absolutely not.
Elise Yarktin,"Frankly, I don't think she's done enough to distance herself from this misogynistic lunacy."
Joan Callamezzo,Let's turn now to Sasha Dunkirk.
Joan Callamezzo,She is head of the group Women Against Feminism.
Kipp Bunthart,What a surprise.
Kipp Bunthart,The woman is only talking to other women.
Kipp Bunthart,Can we have one conversation about feminism where men get to be in charge?
Sasha Dunkirk,I actually agree with him.
Kipp Bunthart,I don't need your pity.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Joan, Leslie Knope and I are united--"
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Brandi Maxxxx,In our disgust of this week's events.
Brandi Maxxxx,"Leslie, if you're watching, I, Brandi Maxxxx, star of 69 Jump Street and Fifty Shaved Old Gays, have your back."
Jennifer Barkley,Oof.
Jennifer Barkley,"You really stepped in it this time, Knope."
Ben Wyatt,Why isn't the other candidate's wife being scrutinized like this?
Jennifer Barkley,Because June Hartwell is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.
Jennifer Barkley,"She started an awareness campaign called ""Bring a Sweater."""
Jennifer Barkley,"She calls it ""goose bump prevention."""
Jennifer Barkley,"Come on, you guys, you know the drill."
Jennifer Barkley,"Just ignore the fact that you're right, put on your blandest outfit-- So that one, hopefully, and then just go out there and publicly apologize."
Jennifer Barkley,Done.
Leslie Knope,What?
Ben Wyatt,Apologize for what?
Jennifer Barkley,Doesn't matter.
Jennifer Barkley,Just say you're sorry.
Jennifer Barkley,It's like taking a shot of tequila.
Jennifer Barkley,"You just gotta force it down, suddenly the world feels so much more pleasant."
Jennifer Barkley,I do three shots every time I have to enter this house.
Jerry Gergich,Donna.
Jerry Gergich,What are you doing here so early?
Donna Meagle,I come bearing gifts.
Donna Meagle,"First off, I got a dude in maintenance to open up that grate this morning."
Donna Meagle,"So here's your rings, keys, credit cards, and I found some heart medicine I assume is yours?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, no."
Jerry Gergich,That's mine.
Jerry Gergich,That's mine.
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, my gosh."
Donna Meagle,"Also, I thought I'd bring over some fresh oranges for you and Gayle."
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, that is just so kind, Donna."
Jerry Gergich,Thank you.
Donna Meagle,"You're one of a kind, Garry."
Jerry Gergich,Oh.
Donna Meagle,"And I just wanna thank you for taking me down memory lane, ya big B word."
Donna Meagle,"""Buddy."""
Councilman Milton,So much has changed around here.
Councilman Milton,"I just wanted to remember the good old days, when a shoeshine was two bits, and there were no Mexicans in the music business."
Ron Swanson,"If you don't mind, Councilman Milton, we just need to search this stand."
April Ludgate,Yes.
April Ludgate,Found it.
Ron Swanson,"""Hi Andy, I hate people, but you are okay"""
Ron Swanson,"""It's weird."""
Ron Swanson,"""Woof, woof."""
Ron Swanson,"""April."""
Andy Dwyer,"My God, babe, you were so into me."
Andy Dwyer,That's hilarious.
Ron Swanson,That's it.
April Ludgate,It's a dead end.
April Ludgate,No more clues.
Ron Swanson,See me in my office.
Andy Dwyer,"If it makes you feel any better, I had a big crush on you too."
April Ludgate,That does make me feel a little better.
April Ludgate,Thanks.
Andy Dwyer,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,Thank God.
Councilman Milton,Get off my boat!
Ben Wyatt,Good afternoon.
Ben Wyatt,I'm here today to share with you all my vision for the economic future of Southern Indiana.
Ben Wyatt,"But first, Leslie Knope, my wife, has a brief statement."
Leslie Knope,"Hello, everyone."
Leslie Knope,Thank you.
Leslie Knope, Wow.
Leslie Knope, How about this weather we're having?
Leslie Knope,Very temperate.
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope," Recently, I made an attempt to--"
Ben Wyatt,"Actually, hang on."
Ben Wyatt, Stop.
Ben Wyatt," I'm sorry, this whole thing just makes me queasy."
Ben Wyatt," I love how independent my wife is, and because of that, I will not let her speak."
Ben Wyatt, That came out wrong.
Ben Wyatt," The point is, Leslie is a great mother, public servant, all-around person, and I am tired of everybody constantly telling her that she's making the wrong choice."
Ben Wyatt," So you can say whatever you want, I couldn't care less about the political consequences."
Leslie Knope," Thank you, Ben."
Leslie Knope, Well.
Leslie Knope, The first thing I'm gonna do is say sorry.
Leslie Knope," I'm sorry that the spotlight is on me and not on Ben, because he is going to make a great congressman."
Leslie Knope," Second, the Male Men. Where are you? Ah."
Leslie Knope," You're ridiculous, and men's rights is nothing."
Leslie Knope," Third, I'm now gonna give you permanent answers to all the silly questions that you're gonna end up asking me, and every other woman in this election, over the next few months."
Leslie Knope," ""Why did I change my hairstyle?"" Oh, I don't know."
Leslie Knope, I just thought it would look better.
Leslie Knope, Or my kids got gum in it.
Leslie Knope," ""Are you trying to have it all?"" That question makes no sense."
Leslie Knope, It's a stupid question.
Leslie Knope, Stop asking it.
Leslie Knope, Don't ask it.
Leslie Knope," ""Do you miss your kids while you're at work?"" Yes, of course I do."
Leslie Knope, Everybody does.
Leslie Knope," And then, you know, sometimes I don't."
Ben Wyatt, Yeah.
Ben Wyatt," And by the way, no one's ever asked me that question."
Ben Wyatt," No one asks me, ""Where are your kids?"" Or, ""Who's taking care of them?"" By the way, who is taking care of the kids right now?"
Leslie Knope,"My mom, babe."
Leslie Knope, Everything's fine.
Ben Wyatt, Right.
Ben Wyatt," So, maybe Leslie doesn't fit your personal idea of what a candidate's wife should be."
Ben Wyatt," So what? That's good, because there shouldn't be just one idea anyway."
Leslie Knope, That's right.
Leslie Knope," If you wanna bake a pie, that's great."
Leslie Knope," If you wanna have a career, that's great, too."
Leslie Knope," Do both, or neither, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope, Just don't judge what someone else has decided to do.
Leslie Knope, We're all just trying to find the right path for us.
Leslie Knope, As individuals.
Leslie Knope, On this Earth.
Ben Wyatt, I'd say that's fifty-fifty boos and cheers.
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, That seems about right.
Kipp Bunthart, Let Ben speak! Let Ben speak!
Leslie Knope,He just spoke.
Kipp Bunthart, Oh.
Kipp Bunthart, Sorry.
Kipp Bunthart, I just got here.
Kipp Bunthart, I had a broken bike chain.
Kipp Bunthart, My bad.
April Ludgate, So I guess we are celebrating that you trusted me and I let you down.
April Ludgate, Great.
Ron Swanson, I change my house locks every 16 days.
Ron Swanson, That key has been useless since the second Tuesday after I gave it to you.
Ron Swanson, What matters is that I trust you and admire you as a person.
Ron Swanson, I will be sorry to see you leave this town.
Ron Swanson, For many reasons.
Ron Swanson, Not the least of which is that you created a puzzle that even I couldn't solve.
Ron Swanson," And boy, oh, boy, did you love Andy."
Ron Swanson," ""Woof, woof."""
Ron Swanson,It really is embarrassing.
April Ludgate," Oh, my God."
April Ludgate, I totally know where the key is.
Ron Swanson, How'd you remember?
April Ludgate,"""Woof, woof."" Bark."
Ron Swanson, Why here?
April Ludgate,Because this tree reminds me of you.
April Ludgate, It's strong.
April Ludgate, And quiet.
April Ludgate, And always here when you need it.
April Ludgate, Or whatever.
Ron Swanson," I have always felt a certain kinship with April, and this is proof that I was correct."
Ron Swanson," Not the nice things she said about me, the fact that I buried a large amount of gold under that same tree years ago."
Ron Swanson, I have since moved it.
Ron Swanson, Or have I?
Ben Wyatt,Elise?
Leslie Knope,What did I do wrong now?
Elise Yarktin,No.
Elise Yarktin," Actually, we at the IOW loved what you said in your speech."
Leslie Knope, Really?
Elise Yarktin,"But... What we loved even more was how you, Ben, gave Leslie a platform in which to speak her mind."
Elise Yarktin," Congratulations, Ben Wyatt, you are this year's IOW Woman of the Year."
Leslie Knope, Son of a bitch.

,Season: 7 Episode: 10
Perd Hapley,It's the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show!
Perd Hapley,"Now, to introduce your host, Johnny Karate, here is me, Perd Hapley!"
Andy Dwyer,Silence!
Andy Dwyer,"Welcome to the only show that's all about learning, music, animals, fireworks, waterskis, and above all, ice cream, pizza, ninjas, getting stronger, sharks versus bears, and above all, karate!"
Andy Dwyer,"Now, why don't you kids help me sing the welcome song?"
Andy Dwyer,Let me just grab my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,Someone has stolen my guitar.
Andy Dwyer,This seems like a case for Special Agent Burt Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't give a crap, Batman."
Andy Dwyer,You work for me.
Andy Dwyer,Increase the perimeter!
Donna Meagle,"Macklin, the President's called six times."
Donna Meagle,"If we don't get that guitar back, the peace in Iraq will be canceled."
Andy Dwyer,"Get off my back, Chief!"
Andy Dwyer,I'm doing the best I can.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't play by the rules, but I get results."
Donna Meagle,Dang it.
Donna Meagle,"You're right again, Macklin."
Donna Meagle,And I'm sorry.
Donna Meagle,You're the best agent I've seen.
Donna Meagle,And I've worked with James Bond.
Donna Meagle,This clue may help.
Andy Dwyer,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,It was left at the crime scene.
Andy Dwyer,You're dismissed.
Andy Dwyer,This case just keeps getting deeper and deeper.
Andy Dwyer,"I'm drowning in the adult end of the pool, and the lifeguard's off in the bathroom pooping."
Andy Dwyer,"That's good, right?"
Andy Dwyer,Johnny Karate's guitar has been stolen.
Andy Dwyer,That instrument is worth literally 900 million dollars.
Andy Dwyer,"But more importantly, he can't play the goodbye song without it."
Andy Dwyer,"So by the time this show is over I will find who stole it, and they will pay the ultimate price."
Extra,A oneway ticket to the Funky Monkey Dunk Tank!
Andy Dwyer,All that and more on the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show!
Andy Dwyer,"It's time to punch boredom in its stupid face Jump, kick, punch and drop And dropkick sadness into outer space Punch, yeah, till you drop It's the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show"
Andy Dwyer,"So, karate masters, you are here for an extra awesome and super special episode of Johnny Karate."
Andy Dwyer,And that is because it's my final show.
All,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,Don't look glum.
Andy Dwyer,"In a couple of weeks, I'll be moving to Washington, D.C."
Andy Dwyer,It's the capital of the entire world.
Andy Dwyer,"They have things there like this white house, and this mental institution."
Andy Dwyer,"And my very favorite, the Lincoln Memorial."
Andy Dwyer,It's this crazy statue of this giant monster sitting on a chair that represents all of America's enemies.
Andy Dwyer,I'll be moving to Washington D.C.
Andy Dwyer,"Because my wife, April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer, has accepted an amazing job there."
Andy Dwyer,I'm very proud of her and totally in love.
Andy Dwyer,April!
Andy Dwyer,Why don't you come on out and talk to the children?
Andy Dwyer,Take a bow for being so cool.
April Ludgate,"Hey, Johnny!"
April Ludgate,So since it's your final show I wanted to do one last extra special April's Animal Corner.
April Ludgate,That's right.
April Ludgate,"This week I brought one of the scariest, weirdest animals in the whole world, A goliath bird eating tarantula."
April Ludgate,"Now the name ""Goliath"" means ""giant."""
April Ludgate,"And you can see that-- Andy, where is it?"
Andy Dwyer,What?
Andy Dwyer,Uh-oh.
April Ludgate,Where is it?
Andy Dwyer,Don't look at me.
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what happened.
Andy Dwyer,I took it out to play hide and seek.
Andy Dwyer,I couldn't find it.
Andy Dwyer,And Oh.
Andy Dwyer,That's what happened.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, once again, April's Animal Corner has turned into one of our favorite segments."
Andy Dwyer,Loose Animal in the Studio.
April Ludgate,Yay!
Andy Dwyer,"And as always, when we accidentally end up doing Loose Animal in the Studio, we have to show you this disclaimer."
Andy Dwyer,Boring.
Andy Dwyer,Here's a disclaimer.
Andy Dwyer,I didn't read this disclaimer.
Andy Dwyer,Ooh.
Andy Dwyer,Good point.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,Done.
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, kids."
Andy Dwyer,So be on the lookout for a-- What's it called?
April Ludgate,A Goliath birdeating tarantula.
April Ludgate,"Known locally to Venezuelans as ""The Devil's Fist."""
April Ludgate,"Bye, kids."
Andy Dwyer,"Okay, kids, well, we've got a lot of work to do performing the Five Karate Moves to Success."
Andy Dwyer,Sing it with me!
Andy Dwyer,"Today we're going to make something, learn something, karate chop something. And then we'll try something new, even if it's scary to you."
Andy Dwyer,"And finally we'll have some fun being nice to someone, Because that's the Johnny Karate way"
Andy Dwyer,"Step one, let's go make something."
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,How are you doing?
Ron Swanson,My contract is very specific.
Ron Swanson,I do not have to answer that question.
Ron Swanson,"This week, I am making a shadowbox frame, which can be used to display an object of great value."
Ron Swanson,This one is constructed with American cherry wood.
Andy Dwyer,"Cherry, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Now, I have just one question."
Ron Swanson,No.
Ron Swanson,The wood does not taste like cherry.
Ron Swanson,You cannot eat it.
Andy Dwyer,"I was not going to eat it, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,I was going to lick it.
Andy Dwyer,"Always remember, kids, when you find something new, you must lick it before you eat it."
Ron Swanson,"That is incorrect, in a number of ways."
Ron Swanson,"I sure have had some fun making things with you, son."
Ron Swanson,Thank you for everything you've done for the children of this area.
Andy Dwyer,"You're welcome, Carpenter Ron."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, kids."
Andy Dwyer,"This, to me, seems like a hug moment."
Ron Swanson,You are mistaken.
Ron Swanson,Remove the graphic.
Andy Dwyer,"Well, kids, it's time for our next karate move to success."
Andy Dwyer,Let's learn something.
Andy Dwyer,"Hello, Professor Smartbrain!"
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, Johnny."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, listen, I don't know if you got my email, but I thought since this is our final show, maybe we not use the Boring Buzzer."
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, kids."
Ben Wyatt,Today we're going to learn about geography.
Ben Wyatt,"Now, you, Johnny, are moving to Washington, D.C."
Ben Wyatt,"I thought what we could talk about is how fast you could get there using an airplane, a train or a car."
Ben Wyatt,"Now as you can see, the airplane is the fastest."
Andy Dwyer,Not the fastest.
Andy Dwyer,What about teleporting?
Ben Wyatt,"Well, sure."
Ben Wyatt,"That would be really fun, but it's impossible."
Andy Dwyer,"Nothing is impossible, kids."
Ben Wyatt,Teleportation is impossible.
Ben Wyatt,It's about theoretical physics.
Ben Wyatt,You asked me to do this.
Ben Wyatt,This was a favor--
Jerry Gergich,"Morning, Johnny!"
Jerry Gergich,Mail call!
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Mailman Barry!"
Andy Dwyer,Who brought me mail today?
Jerry Gergich,"Well, Johnny, you got over 500 letters, from kids who love you, asking for you and April to stay."
Andy Dwyer,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, did you hear that?"
Jerry Gergich,"Now, Johnny, you also got one very special letter."
Jerry Gergich,It's from me.
Jerry Gergich,"And on the last day of your show, I thought I could read it to you."
All,Aw.
Jerry Gergich,"""Dearest Andy, I've never had a son of my own, and I just want you to know that for the past 10 years"""
Andy Dwyer, It's time to karate chop something!
Andy Dwyer,"Ninjas, attack!"
Jerry Gergich,"Ah, jeez."
Andy Dwyer,Disperse!
Andy Dwyer,"Remember, never attack a real postal employee."
Andy Dwyer,We're allowed to attack Mailman Barry because he volunteered to help us with our karate moves.
Jerry Gergich,I kind of thought I'd be holding a piece of wood or something.
Jerry Gergich,"But, you know, always happy to help."
Andy Dwyer,"Next up, we're going to try something new with my good friend Leslie Knope."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, Johnny Karate!"
Leslie Knope,I'm so happy to be here on your last show ever.
Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Leslie."
Andy Dwyer,I'm glad you're here to teach us all how to be brave.
Andy Dwyer,"So, Leslie, what are you going to be trying new this week?"
Leslie Knope,I am going to be taking over hosting my friend's TV show.
Andy Dwyer,Huh?
Leslie Knope,"Isn't that right, April?"
April Ludgate,That is right.
April Ludgate,"Johnny, you have made so many kids and so many parents so happy that we wanted to give you a proper sendoff."
Leslie Knope,"Andy Dwyer/ Johnny Karate, this is your life!"
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my gosh."
Andy Dwyer,"Leslie, this is amazing."
Andy Dwyer,I don't know what to say.
Andy Dwyer,"Literally, because normally I have a script that I have to stick to."
Andy Dwyer,But I don't know what I'm supposed to say right now.
Andy Dwyer,It's kind of a nightmare.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,"You leave that to us, Johnny."
April Ludgate,"Uh, when we come back, we will take a look at the journey of Andy Dwyer."
April Ludgate,Stay tuned.
Perd Hapley,"""Now listen to some words from our sponsors"" are the words I'm saying right now."
Ron Swanson,Hire Very Good Building Company for your construction needs.
Ron Swanson,Or do not.
Ron Swanson,I am not a beggar.
Ron Swanson,End of commercial.
Ken Hotate,"The Wamapoke people have a saying, ""Only one who listens hears the cry of the wolf."""
Ken Hotate,That advice has been passed down from generation to generation.
Ken Hotate,"Today, I give that advice to you."
Ken Hotate,Listen for Coinsy the Wolf at Wamapoke Casino.
Ken Hotate,"Twice a day, one lucky visitor will hit the mega wolf jackpot, and Coinsy will howl for you."
Ken Hotate,"Wamapoke Casino, slowly taking our money back from white people, one quarter at a time."
Perd Hapley,The thing we return to now is my Johnny Karate Show return message.
Leslie Knope,Welcome back.
Leslie Knope,"When I first met the man standing next to me, he was not a cultural phenomenon."
Andy Dwyer,"""Phenomenon"" means ""to explore a cave."""
Leslie Knope,He was going through a tough time.
Leslie Knope,He had just broken both legs from falling into a pit.
Andy Dwyer,I was super wasted.
Leslie Knope,"It's a kid's show, Andy."
Andy Dwyer,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Leslie Knope,Kid's show.
Andy Dwyer,Good call.
Leslie Knope,"That event set in motion many wonderful things in my life, including the building of the Pawnee Commons."
Leslie Knope,"So, in a weird way, Andy, I owe it all to you."
Andy Dwyer,"And now that the show is ending, I'm gonna have to start all over again."
Andy Dwyer,Hopefully there's a pit in Washington D.C. that I could fall into.
Leslie Knope,Andy pulled his life together and he got himself a job at the shoeshine stand in City Hall.
Ben Wyatt,He then became a bureaucratic assistant.
Ben Wyatt,"Hi, honey."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, hi."
Ben Wyatt,"He was always enthusiastic, but he also kept track of his appointments by writing them on his arm."
Andy Dwyer,Still do!
Leslie Knope,"To commemorate that time and to make sure that you never miss another appointment again, we have brought you a monogrammed day planner."
Andy Dwyer,"Guys, that's so sweet."
Leslie Knope,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
Andy Dwyer,Aw.
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, no, I lost it."
Andy Dwyer,The day planner's gone.
Andy Dwyer,I can't find it anywhere.
Ben Wyatt,What?
Ben Wyatt,"Fitting, really."
Leslie Knope,"From then, Andy went to England for a few months to work for a nonprofit."
Leslie Knope,"It was there that he befriended the 14th Earl of Cornwall upon Thames, Sir Edgar Covington."
Leslie Knope,Tada!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, my God, Eddie!"
Andy Dwyer,This is amazing!
Edgar Covington,"Andy, I am here in this weird, flat place, to name you a loyal and true karate defender of the Queen's Realm."
Edgar Covington,Please get down on one knee.
Edgar Covington,"This honor is bestowed on those who have shown great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science."
Edgar Covington,"Therefore, I hereby dub thee a knight of the Order of the British Empire."
Ben Wyatt,Hang on.
Ben Wyatt,Can you actually do this?
Edgar Covington,"Well, technically, only the Queen can knight somebody, but I'm so rich that she lets me do what I want."
Edgar Covington,Would you like to be knighted?
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."
Ben Wyatt,Of course not.
Ben Wyatt,It's Andy's day.
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, I don't mind."
Ben Wyatt,Oh!
Ben Wyatt,"Then, yes, knight me, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God, this is amazing."
Ben Wyatt,Winter is coming for Ser Ben Lightstorm.
Edgar Covington,"Okay, you're both knights."
Andy Dwyer,Cool.
Edgar Covington,"Guys, this was so much fun."
Leslie Knope,"Friend, coworker, musician, husband Andy Dwyer--"
Andy Dwyer,Sir Andy Dwyer.
Leslie Knope,Sir Andy Dwyer had become so many things to so many people.
Leslie Knope,But his greatest creation was yet to come.
Leslie Knope,A salute to Johnny Karate when we come back!
Commercial,We know what you want.
Commercial,"Healthy, natural food that still tastes great."
Commercial,And we're here to tell you it doesn't exist. Healthy food is for suckers.
Commercial,"It tastes like garbage and if you say you like it, you're a chump and a liar."
Commercial,Be honest.
Commercial,This is what you want to eat.
Commercial,It tastes amazing.
Commercial,What's in it?
Commercial,Who cares?
Commercial,How many calories?
Commercial,Shut up.
Commercial,It's awesome.
Commercial,"Put it in your body, or you're a nerd."
Perd Hapley,"One of Andy's greatest achievements was the success of his band, Mouse Rat."
Burly,No one was doing what we were doing.
Burly,"Well, that's not really true."
Burly,We were basically playing covers of Dave Matthews songs.
Burly,So I guess you could say Dave Matthews was doing what we were doing.
Rivers,To play in a band like Mouse Rat that brought such joy to so many was... Truly was a mitzvah.
Rivers,"I should mention, I'm a rabbi now."
Perd Hapley,"For the full rockumentary, go to And now, back to the show."
Leslie Knope,"Every hero struggles with failure, faces something they cannot do."
Leslie Knope,Andy faced one of those moments just a few years ago.
Andy Dwyer,"I would've chugged that entire gallon of milk, had I not started puking out of nowhere."
Leslie Knope,"No, you did not achieve your dream of becoming a Pawnee police officer."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,Right.
Leslie Knope,"But you did create Burt Macklin, a character who exemplifies everything that is great about law enforcement."
Leslie Knope,Take a look.
Andy Dwyer,My name is Burt Tyrannosaurus Macklin.
Andy Dwyer,"I don't know what the problem is, Sergeant."
Andy Dwyer,Just drain the ocean.
Police Officer,"Andy, on behalf of the entire Pawnee Police Department, I'd like to present you with this genuine Pawnee police badge."
Andy Dwyer,Wow!
Ron Swanson,It's ensconced forever in the shadowbox we made earlier.
Andy Dwyer,How about that?
Leslie Knope,No!
Ron Swanson,"Son, we spent four days making that."
Andy Dwyer,"This means so, so much to me."
Andy Dwyer,I'm a cop!
Andy Dwyer,I should get some handcuffs too!
Andy Dwyer,"Give me your cuffs, Randy."
Police Officer,"No, no."
Police Officer,It's an honorary title.
Andy Dwyer,"Stand down, sir."
Police Officer,Quit it!
Leslie Knope,"Andy, now that you are an official police officer--"
Police Officer,He's not.
Police Officer,"I want to make it clear, he's not."
Leslie Knope,You should be able to solve the case of the missing guitar.
Leslie Knope,"So, grab your clue and head on over to Professor Smartbrain."
Andy Dwyer,"Professor Smartbrain, this piece of fabric was found at the scene."
Andy Dwyer,Look at it under your telescope.
Ben Wyatt,Hmm.
Ben Wyatt,It looks like there are some tiny initials.
Ben Wyatt,"""J.C?"""
Andy Dwyer,President Jimmy Carter stole my guitar?
Andy Dwyer,But why?
Ben Wyatt,"I don't think it's Jimmy Carter, buddy."
John Cena,The champ is here!
John Cena,"Hi, kids."
John Cena,Is everybody having a great time?
Andy Dwyer,I know I am!
Andy Dwyer,John Cena in the house!
Andy Dwyer,"John Cena, you're my hero!"
John Cena,Wait.
John Cena,You're Andy.
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,I'm Andy.
John Cena,From the information I got I just assumed you'd be like 10 years old.
Andy Dwyer,Thank you.
John Cena,"That's Okay, great."
John Cena,Thank you.
John Cena,"Thank you so much, man, For bringing martial arts and music to all the children."
John Cena,"Wait, wait, wait."
John Cena,"What are you doing, man?"
Andy Dwyer,Gotcha!
John Cena,Got me?
John Cena,Wait.
John Cena,What?
Police Officer,He got my cuffs.
Police Officer,Wait.
Police Officer, What the hell is this? 
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Andy Dwyer,"John Cena, you're a great inspiration, a true hero, and this is the greatest moment of my life."
Andy Dwyer, But you're going down.
John Cena, Going down? What are you doing Whoa! Stop!
Andy Dwyer,You stole Johnny Karate's guitar.
John Cena," I didn't steal his guitar, man."
John Cena, I'm just doing this as a favor.
Andy Dwyer," You're going in the dunk tank, bud."
John Cena, I don't wanna go in the dunk tank.
Andy Dwyer, Shut up.
John Cena," Is anybody in charge? Uh, a little help?"
Leslie Knope,"And now it's time to celebrate Andy Dwyer's greatest creation, Johnny Karate."
Leslie Knope, He has brought so much happiness to so many children in southern Indiana that we thought a piece of Johnny Karate should stay here in Pawnee.
Donna Meagle, Everybody was kung fu fighting
Leslie Knope,Raise it up!
Donna Meagle,Those cats were fast as lightning
Andy Dwyer,This is awesome.
Andy Dwyer," Can you believe it, babe?"
Donna Meagle,In fact it was a little bit frightening
Leslie Knope,That karate gi will stay here forever.
Leslie Knope," Well, not here, here, because this studio actually has a show where divorced couples work out their problems, so that might be weird if that thing was hanging over them."
Leslie Knope, But it'll be somewhere.
Leslie Knope, And the spirit will stay with us.
Leslie Knope, Forever.
Leslie Knope," Andy Dwyer's final goodbye, when we come back."
Commercial," What powers us? What gives us the tools to attain our goals, face our fears, take that next step into the unknown? It's energy."
Commercial,"Verizon, Exxon, and Chipotle are proud to announce a cross-platform merger of our three great brands."
Commercial," Whether it's extending your 6G coverage, drilling natural gas out of shale or perfecting the chicken quesadilla, we will give you the energy to get you to the next level."
Commercial," And with enough energy, America, nothing can stop us."
Commercial, The all-new Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon.
Commercial,Proud to be one of America's 8 companies.
Andy Dwyer, I'd like to begin by saying thank you to anyone who has ever worked on the Johnny Karate Musical Explosion Show.
Andy Dwyer," This has been the greatest job I've ever had, and today has been the best day of my life."
Andy Dwyer, And that's saying something.
Andy Dwyer, I once found a rock that looked exactly like Santa Claus.
Andy Dwyer," Hat and everything, so... Before I say goodbye, let's review our checklist one last time."
Andy Dwyer, We made something with Carpenter Ron.
Andy Dwyer, We learned something with Professor Smartbrain.
Andy Dwyer," We karate-chopped something, old Mailman Barry's face."
Andy Dwyer," And we tried something new, even though it was scary to us, with Leslie Knope."
Andy Dwyer, That leaves just one more thing.

Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, guys."
Ben Wyatt,Listen.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, Leslie's gonna walk in and say something that sounds very boring, but is actually a really big deal."
Ben Wyatt,"So when I give the signal, just, everybody, cheer like crazy."
Ben Wyatt,Here we go.
Leslie Knope,"Well, someone just officially enrolled in the Senior Executive Service Development Candidate Program at the Department of the Interior."
Andy Dwyer,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,Thanks.
Leslie Knope,It's a big deal.
Leslie Knope,"So, my promotion is official."
Leslie Knope,We need to find a place in D.C.
Leslie Knope,Because we're gonna be splitting our time.
Donna Meagle,I guess now is as good a time as any to make my announcement.
Donna Meagle,Joe and I just closed on a house in Seattle.
April Ludgate,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope,Cheers.
Jerry Gergich,"Well, actually, I have an announcement, too."
Jerry Gergich,"After all these years in government, I have decided to finally retire."
April Ludgate,"This is about people who are moving, Garry."
April Ludgate,Not everything is about you.
Jerry Gergich,Good point.
Leslie Knope,Everyone's scattering.
Leslie Knope,"Well, look at it this way."
Leslie Knope,"Bad news comes in threes, right?"
Leslie Knope,"We're leaving, April and Andy are leaving, Donna's leaving."
Leslie Knope,That's three!
Jerry Gergich,"Also, I'm retiring."
Leslie Knope,"That's three, Garry."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're probably due for some good news."
Perd Hapley,Good evening.
Perd Hapley,I come to you tonight with some good news.
Ben Wyatt,Hey.
Perd Hapley,Is not a sentence I will be saying to you right now.
Perd Hapley,"Because, beloved Pawnee Mayor Walter Gunderson has died."
Leslie Knope,"Well, you jinxed us, Garry."
Leslie Knope,Thanks a lot.
Ben Wyatt,Walter Gunderson served Pawnee for 39 years.
Ben Wyatt,"And as per his final wish, his body will lie in state, in the city council chambers for a day."
Ben Wyatt,Which is just a real cool thing for a public space.
Ben Wyatt,"Also, he sent us a brief video message to be played for this event."
Walter Gunderson,"Hello, Pawnee."
Walter Gunderson,My time in office has come to an end.
Walter Gunderson,A lot has been done.
Walter Gunderson,But I wasn't really doing very much.
Walter Gunderson,I wasn't paying attention most of the time.
Walter Gunderson,"Fortunately, the citizens of Pawnee didn't pay attention either."
Walter Gunderson,"So, uh, if there's credit to take, I will humbly take it."
Walter Gunderson,"And if there is blame, it's your fault."
Walter Gunderson,Thank you.
Walter Gunderson,And goodbye forever.
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,"Well, that was really something."
Leslie Knope,"People are dying, moving, retiring."
Leslie Knope,"Too many endings, not enough beginnings."
Leslie Knope,We need something to begin.
Leslie Knope,And I have just the thing.
Leslie Knope,An underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.
Leslie Knope,But someone here will.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, April."
Ben Wyatt,Will you help me out with something?
April Ludgate,No.
Ben Wyatt,"Apparently, as city manager, I'm in charge of appointing an interim mayor until the special election."
April Ludgate,"So, why don't you just appoint yourself?"
April Ludgate,You're basically running the town anyway.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, I was a mayor once before."
Ben Wyatt,We all remember how that went.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah, you completely disgraced yourself and destroyed an entire town."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, I said we all remember."
Ben Wyatt,Now will you help me find someone?
Ben Wyatt,It can be anyone over the age of 30 who's a good symbolic face for the town.
April Ludgate,"Fine, whatever, I'll help you."
April Ludgate,Okay?
Ben Wyatt,Thank you.
Ben Wyatt,I told Garry he could help too.
April Ludgate,What?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, notarizing a new mayor, that is-- Well, it's like the ultimate notary adventure."
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, it's big."
Tom Haverford,LesLegally Blonde.
Tom Haverford,Got you a little gift in New York.
Leslie Knope,You did.
Leslie Knope,What did you get me?
Leslie Knope,Oohlala.
Leslie Knope,Men's Ferragamo loafers.
Leslie Knope,What am I supposed to do with these?
Tom Haverford,"Yeah, you're right, I should probably keep 'em."
Tom Haverford,"They're a size six and a half, too small for you anyway."
Leslie Knope,How was your trip?
Tom Haverford,Amazing.
Tom Haverford,Lot of great meetings.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, Lucy and I had the best time."
Tom Haverford,"It's for real, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,We even went to a jewelry store and looked at rings.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,"Shia LaBeouf is one hell of a jewelry designer, by the way."
Tom Haverford,The man's really found his calling.
Leslie Knope,This is perfect.
Leslie Knope,"What with everything ending, you guys are the happy beginning that we all need."
Leslie Knope,You should propose to her.
Leslie Knope,Right now.
Leslie Knope,Here.
Leslie Knope,What better place to ask a woman to marry you than an old man's public memorial?
Tom Haverford,Yeah.
Tom Haverford,I think I'm probably gonna wait.
Tom Haverford,"Plus, Lucy's not in town."
Tom Haverford,She's in Philadelphia visiting friends.
Tom Haverford,She gets back tomorrow.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, you'd probably want her here for that, right?"
Tom Haverford,All right.
Tom Haverford,I'm gonna find April.
Tom Haverford,I got her a really nice Burberry necktie.
Andy Dwyer,Gunderson was mayor my entire life.
Andy Dwyer,It really makes you consider the postulence of time.
Donna Meagle,Sure.
Ron Swanson,"Death is natural, Andrew."
Ron Swanson,"We're born, we survive as long as we're useful, and then we're killed, either by our body's natural decay or by those younger and stronger."
Donna Meagle,Speak for yourself.
Donna Meagle,"Before I die, I'm freezing my head like Ted Williams."
Donna Meagle,"Wait a thousand years, thaw it out, slap it on a robot,  Keep on ballin'."
Carl,Ron.
Ron Swanson,Carl.
Ron Swanson,"Donna, Andy, this is Carl."
Ron Swanson,He owns the deli right next to my barber Salvatore's shop.
Carl,"It's terrible, isn't it?"
Carl,First Salvatore and now Mayor Gunderson.
Ron Swanson,What?
Ron Swanson,What happened?
Ron Swanson,Explain yourself.
Carl,"Oh, Ron, you didn't hear?"
Carl,Salvatore passed away yesterday.
Ron Swanson,No.
Donna Meagle,Jeez.
Ron Swanson,"No, it can't be."
Andy Dwyer,"Was he killed by a younger, stronger barber?"
Ben Wyatt,"And now, here to say a few words is Mayor Gunderson's longtime friend and coworker, Ethel Beavers."
Leslie Knope,This is gonna be so sad.
Leslie Knope,They worked together for a long time.
Ethel Beavers,I'll be brief.
Ethel Beavers,Walter Gunderson and his wife had an open marriage.
Ethel Beavers,It kept him happy.
Ethel Beavers,It kept his wife happy.
Ethel Beavers,"Hi, Evelyn."
Ethel Beavers,And it definitely kept me happy.
Leslie Knope,What is happening?
Ethel Beavers,"Because for 46 wonderful years, he spent night after night exploring every nook and cranny of my body."
Ethel Beavers,"Grow up, you prudes."
Ethel Beavers,We're all adults.
Ethel Beavers,My only regret is that I never told him how I really felt.
Ethel Beavers,"So, I'll say it now."
Ethel Beavers,"I loved that man, and not just because he was a dynamite lay."
Ethel Beavers,"Good night, you animal."
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Listen to Ethel.
Tom Haverford,Mmm.
Tom Haverford,"No, it's too gross."
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,Listen to her message.
Leslie Knope,You can't wait to tell someone how you feel.
Leslie Knope,"Because if you wait, before you know it Boom!"
Leslie Knope,"46 years later, they're gone."
Tom Haverford,You're right.
Tom Haverford,"We know we want to be together forever, so why wait?"
Leslie Knope,Exactly.
Leslie Knope,And I will help you with the proposal.
Leslie Knope,What do you wanna do?
Tom Haverford,"Off the top of my head, I guess, my ideal proposal might be a multiplatform media experience."
Tom Haverford,"An action movie, with explosive graphics, fast cars and a hero with one mission, to propose to his lady."
Tom Haverford,A hero named Tom Haverford.
Leslie Knope,Tom Haverford
Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah!"
Tom Haverford,Yes!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, um People grieve in different ways."
Leslie Knope,"Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out ""Lucy, will you marry me?"", then you have no business calling yourself a pet store."
Tom Haverford,Why can't everyone share our commitment to the basic concept of outrageous pageantry?
Leslie Knope,"I don't know, Tom."
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Ian,"Oh, no."
Ian,"What do you want, Leslie?"
Leslie Knope,"Hey, lan."
Leslie Knope,"I need a gigantic banner that says ""Congratulations, Lucy and Tom,"" and I need it by tomorrow."
Ian,No way.
Ian,Impossible.
Leslie Knope,"Over the past 15 years, I have spent nearly a hundred thousand dollars at your banner store."
Leslie Knope,I have ordered banners for every personal and professional event that I've ever organized.
Leslie Knope,"My credit card company called me about it, not to question the charges, but to sincerely ask me if I was mentally stable."
Tom Haverford,"See that Rolex Submariner on your wrist, bro."
Tom Haverford,That's 'cause of Leslie.
Tom Haverford,You'll have the banner done.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Bobby."
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for coming in.
Bobby Newport,Good to see you guys.
Bobby Newport,It's been a while.
Bobby Newport,How's Leslie?
Bobby Newport,"Is she still, um Uh Oh."
Bobby Newport,"What was that thing we ran for, again?"
Ben Wyatt,City Councilor.
Bobby Newport,"Well, all right."
Bobby Newport,If you say so.
Bobby Newport,"I tell ya, it's so hard to remember boring stuff like that."
Ben Wyatt,"Choosing to ignore what you just said, we need an interim mayor, just for two months."
Ben Wyatt,"And given your family name and how well liked you are, I thought you might be interested."
Bobby Newport,"What, mayor?"
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Bobby Newport,"Man, that would be fun."
Bobby Newport,"God, I don't think I can do it, though."
Bobby Newport,"Yeah, 'cause I'm getting ready to go on a big trip."
Bobby Newport,To space.
Bobby Newport,"That'll be really fun, too."
Bobby Newport,"Everything in life is always just so fun, right?"
Jerry Gergich,It really is.
Bobby Newport,"See, this guy knows what's what."
Jerry Gergich,Yeah.
Jerry Gergich,"Ooh, uh What's that?"
Bobby Newport,"Hey, Ben, have you ever been to space?"
Bobby Newport,You should check it out.
Bobby Newport,Seriously.
Bobby Newport,I'm sure the Russian guys who built the rocket would be cool with it.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Bobby Newport,Just one thing.
Bobby Newport,"Do you have 600,000 dollars?"
Bobby Newport,That's what they need for the deposit.
Ben Wyatt,Oh.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, no."
April Ludgate,I've already been to space.
April Ludgate,I was the second person to walk on the moon.
April Ludgate,"Buzz Aldrin, nice to meet you."
Bobby Newport,Nice try.
Bobby Newport,That's the guy from Toy Story.
Donna Meagle,"We're so sorry, Ron."
Donna Meagle,You guys were close?
Ron Swanson,I've seen Salvatore the first Tuesday of the month for the past four decades.
Ron Swanson,Same exact thing every time.
Ron Swanson,I paid him $8.
Ron Swanson,"I sat in the same chair, Salvatore put the same cape over me."
Ron Swanson,And then he'd always ask me about the same thing.
Ron Swanson,Nothing.
Ron Swanson,It was perfect.
Ron Swanson,I can't delay this forever.
Ron Swanson,Excuse me.
Ron Swanson,"The three most important people in a man's life are his barber, his butcher and his lover."
Ron Swanson,I have lost one of those.
Ron Swanson,"Here's a tenner, Sal."
Ron Swanson,"As you know I don't believe in tipping, so I will collect my change from your wife."
Ron Swanson,I had an appointment with Salvatore scheduled for Tuesday.
Ron Swanson,Look how raggedy my hair is.
Ron Swanson,"What am I supposed to be, some kind of rock star?"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, there's your mark, you'll enter from the front."
Leslie Knope,"Ted, are we rolling?"
Theodore,I think so.
Theodore,I don't really know.
Theodore,Just please be careful with my store?
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,Quiet on the set!
Leslie Knope,Action.
Leslie Knope,"'Allo, would you like to see some rings, Agent Haverford?"
Tom Haverford,Why are you doing an accent?
Leslie Knope,I came up with a backstory for my character.
Leslie Knope,"She's married to a French billionaire, and she has a twin sister, identical, and they keep--"
Tom Haverford,"Leslie, you have one line."
Leslie Knope,"Well, I committed to the role!"
Leslie Knope,'Allo.
Leslie Knope,Would you like to see some gorgeous jewelry?
Leslie Knope,We have the most rare diamonds in the world.
Tom Haverford,I'll take that one.
Tom Haverford,The most expensive one.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Not so fast, Haverfraud."
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Zut alors!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Get him, boys."
Leslie Knope,Freeze.
Leslie Knope,Stunt double.
Leslie Knope,Tom.
Leslie Knope,Action!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Go, my puppets."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Go, my puppets!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Fight.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Fight, my puppets!"
Leslie Knope,Rack focus.
Leslie Knope,Pan left.
Theodore,I don't know what any of that means.
Leslie Knope,Just get the right Go under the--
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,My puppets!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, that's it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, you want the big dog?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Is that what you want?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You want the big dog?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ahhh!
Tom Haverford,"Lucy, your mission, should you choose to accept it is, to marry me."
Leslie Knope,And cut.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my gosh."
Leslie Knope,"Tom, that was amazing!"
Theodore,"No, it wasn't."
Theodore,You just destroyed my case.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,"It's the movie business, Ted."
Leslie Knope,You knew the risks.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, everybody in the van."
Leslie Knope,We're headed to the next location.
April Ludgate,You should totally do it.
April Ludgate,You'd be an amazing mayor.
April Ludgate,"Actually, you should be President."
April Ludgate,Of the universe.
Joan Callamezzo,Oh.
Joan Callamezzo,"You know, I really would make an incredible mayor."
Joan Callamezzo,"But sadly, I cannot."
Joan Callamezzo,Because I'm only 27 years old.
Ben Wyatt,Really?
Ben Wyatt,"So, you were born in the 1990s?"
Joan Callamezzo,Ooh!
Joan Callamezzo,Mmmhmm.
Dr. Saperstein,"What a lovely offer, but I think not."
Dr. Saperstein,"You know, I've got my hands full with my practice, my other businesses, my two terrible children."
Dr. Saperstein,I don't think I have time to be mayor.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Hold up.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"I will do John Mayer, again."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Daddy, someone set a fire in your car because you took too long and I got bored."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no."
Ben Wyatt,"No, there's no money."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Oh.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"My bad, no problem."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Oh, okay."
Ben Wyatt,That's fine.
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Um, I'll just destroy this office."
Ben Wyatt,Whoa!
Ben Wyatt,Hey!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please!"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Money, please."
Dr. Saperstein,Ben.
Dr. Saperstein,Give her some money.
Dr. Saperstein,It's easier.
Ben Wyatt,"I have to say, The Douche, I'm skeptical that your interest is sincere."
The Douche,I can understand that.
The Douche,A morning shockjock DJ the Mayor?
The Douche,But keep an open mind.
The Douche,I went to Northwestern.
The Douche,"I've worked on two political campaigns, and I spend all of my time communicating with the public."
Ben Wyatt,That's actually a good point.
The Douche,I could do some great things for this city.
The Douche,And some gross things with those juicy City Hall interns.
The Douche,Ga-ga-goink!
Ben Wyatt,Okay.
Ben Wyatt,Well.
Ben Wyatt,Thanks for coming in.
The Douche,"All right, ""B""."
The Douche,Let me know.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,Ah.
April Ludgate,"Well, I think we have our answer."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, come on."
Ben Wyatt,Think.
Ben Wyatt,There's got to be someone.
April Ludgate,Okay.
April Ludgate,Ben.
April Ludgate,"You know that I despise you, and that I want you and all people on Earth to be miserable."
April Ludgate,Right?
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
April Ludgate,You should be mayor.
April Ludgate,You're the best person for the job and you deserve it.
April Ludgate,"Plus, this would erase Ice Town."
April Ludgate,It's been torturing you since you were 18 years old.
April Ludgate,"And if you became Mayor of Pawnee, you could put it behind you, once and for all."
April Ludgate,Ugh.
April Ludgate,Being nice made me feel terrible.
The Douche,My oral office.
Ben Wyatt,What?
The Douche,I'm gonna turn the mayoral office into my oral office.
The Douche,Boom!
The Douche,"Thought of it a second ago, had to pop back in."
Ben Wyatt,"""Had to""?"
The Douche,Had to.
Donna Meagle,"Buck up, Swanson."
Donna Meagle,"It's like you said, death is natural."
Donna Meagle,"And Sal lived a good, long life."
Ron Swanson,"But so much is changing, and I've never been a fan of change."
Ron Swanson,Salvatore was a constant in my life.
Ron Dunn,"In my experience, the only ""constant"" is change."
Ron Swanson,Oh [bleep].
Ron Dunn,"Nice to see you, Ron."
Ron Dunn,I couldn't help but overhear.
Ron Dunn,I sure am sorry about your loss.
Ron Dunn,"Every time we lose a compadre, our collective lantern gets a little bit dimmer."
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you look awful familiar."
Andy Dwyer,Have we met before?
Ron Dunn,I'm sure our souls have collided in one lifetime or another.
Andy Dwyer,"No, that's not it."
Andy Dwyer,Are you in my Frisbee golf league?
Ron Dunn,"Oh, yeah."
Ron Dunn,I play for the Super Spinners.
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Andy Dwyer,I'm on the Frisbee Champs.
Ron Dunn,"Ah, cool."
Andy Dwyer,I named us.
Ron Swanson,"Andrew, stop speaking to this man."
Ron Swanson,He is the worst human being on Earth.
Ron Dunn,"Oh, come on."
Ron Dunn,Death makes brothers of us all.
Ron Dunn,"I've always found that when my soul aches with loss, it's best to turn to Eastern wisdom."
Ron Swanson,This is from the Isle of Islay in Scotland.
Ron Swanson,This is as eastern as my wisdom gets.
Donna Meagle,"Swanson, this handsome spiritual cowboy may actually be right about turning to the east."
Donna Meagle,I have an idea.
Donna Meagle,Trust me?
Andy Dwyer,Who cuts your hair?
Ron Dunn,Nobody.
Ron Dunn,"Whenever my hair feels it has completed its journey, it simply sheds itself off."
Ron Swanson,I hate you so much.
Ron Dunn,"And I love you, my brother."
Tom Haverford,I'm really glad you were here to help me with all this today.
Tom Haverford,"You've always been there for me, and I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're pretty cool."
Leslie Knope,I'm cool?
Leslie Knope,I'm cool.
Leslie Knope,I'm a cool dudette.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,It's pizza time.
Tom Haverford,And you've lost it.
Leslie Knope,No.
Tom Haverford,"Hey, there's Lucy."
Lucy,"Hey, babe."
Tom Haverford,We're calling this off.
Tom Haverford,It's all wrong.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, no!"
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,"Is it because I said, ""It's pizza time""?"
Tom Haverford,"No, but that definitely didn't help."
Leslie Knope,What's happening?
Tom Haverford,"Grab Jean-Ralphio, and get these three things."
Tom Haverford,And meet me at the Snakehole Lounge in 30 minutes.
Leslie Knope,"I have no idea what's happening, and I'm very scared that everything is falling apart."
Leslie Knope,But you seem like James Bond right now.
Tom Haverford,Go!
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Tommy ""T"", we got you everything you asked for."
Tom Haverford,I didn't ask for flavored condoms.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Oh, no, no, that's just me looking out for you."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"See, girls get mad horny when you propose."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,That's why I do it all the time.
Leslie Knope,"Okay, what are we doing?"
Leslie Knope,There are hundreds of people waiting for us.
Tom Haverford,"No time to explain, Les, but don't worry, I have a plan."
Leslie Knope,Fine.
Leslie Knope,I will leave.
Leslie Knope,Good luck.
Tom Haverford,You wanna stay and hide and watch the proposal?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, of course!"
Leslie Knope,"Okay, I already picked a place."
Leslie Knope,Don't follow me!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,But I'm gonna.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm gonna.
Ben Wyatt,I can't believe I'm about to be the mayor.
Jerry Gergich,I can't believe I'm about to notarize it.
Jerry Gergich,Okay.
Jerry Gergich," So, look, just sign right there and then we can let the notary fireworks begin!"
Ben Wyatt,No.
Ben Wyatt, I don't wanna do this.
April Ludgate, Why?
Ben Wyatt,"I spent so long trying to forget about Ice Town, but it's part of my life."
Ben Wyatt, It set me on this path.
Ben Wyatt," It led me to Pawnee, to my job, to Leslie."
Ben Wyatt, Who knows where I'd be without it.
Ben Wyatt, I like that Ice Town happened.
Ben Wyatt, And I don't wanna erase it.
April Ludgate, Okay.
April Ludgate," I wasn't listening to anything you just said, but who is gonna be the mayor for the next two months then?"
Ben Wyatt,Garry Gergich.
Ben Wyatt," How would you like to be the next mayor of Pawnee, Indiana?"
April Ludgate,No!
Lucy,What is all this?
Tom Haverford,The Snakehole Lounge is where we first met.
Tom Haverford," On our first date, I gave you a single daisy, like this."
Tom Haverford, And after that we ate late night pancakes at J.J's.
Tom Haverford," And while we were there, I pulled out a deck of cards, and I tried to show you a magic trick I learned on a David Blaine special."
Tom Haverford," Unsurprisingly, I failed, and you made fun of me, ruthlessly."
Tom Haverford," I haven't done this trick in a while, but I think I'm ready to try it again."
Tom Haverford, Pick a card.
Tom Haverford," No, no, no."
Tom Haverford, Go a little bit over to the left.
Tom Haverford, There you go.
Lucy, Yes!
Tom Haverford,Really?
Lucy,Yes.
Tom Haverford, Yay!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, That was so sweet.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein, It really was.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein," So, what's your story again? I mean, how married are you? Are you down to clown? You in that rude mood?"
Leslie Knope,Why are you like this?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Pills, baby!"
Typhoon,"Donna, this is crazy."
Typhoon, Typhoon is an artist and the human head is--
Donna Meagle,Is his canvas.
Donna Meagle, Just listen.
Donna Meagle," You're gonna cut the man's hair, you're gonna charge him $8."
Donna Meagle, It will take you four minutes.
Donna Meagle, So just shut up and make the man look like this.
Typhoon, Fine.
Typhoon, Ugh.
Ron Swanson," So, Typhoon, what do you like to do for fun?"
Typhoon,"I'm writing an electronic opera about Brittany Murphy, and I do the chandelier design for my friend's drag puppet show."
Ron Swanson, No further questions.
Typhoon, All I really want to do is dance.
Typhoon," Except lately, all the good warehouse raves are filled with Euro trash."
Ron Swanson, Euro trash.
Ron Swanson, I like that.
Ron Swanson," It is, indeed, a garbage continent."
Typhoon, Yes.
Typhoon," Oh, my God, I had the worst time in Berlin last May."
Typhoon, Everyone was on their stupid bikes.
Typhoon," I was like, ""Ew""."
Ron Swanson," Please, talk more about how you hate Europe and bicycles."
Tom Haverford, Sorry about the audible.
Tom Haverford, I just realized Lucy doesn't care about all that flashy stuff.
Tom Haverford, That's not the way to her heart.
Tom Haverford," Frankly, I'm stunned she's still even into me."
Leslie Knope, No.
Leslie Knope, You were right to change course.
Leslie Knope, It was perfect and beautiful.
Leslie Knope, There's still a very big celebration awaiting you and your fiancee.
Tom Haverford," I think Lucy probably wants to hang, just the two of us."
Tom Haverford," I'll see you later, Jennifer Knope-ez."
Leslie Knope," Catch you on the flipside, Tom-egranate Juice."
Tom Haverford," Hey, not bad."

Ben Wyatt," Oh, that's awesome."
Ben Wyatt," More good news, I finally found someone to be mayor."
Ben Wyatt, Garry.
Leslie Knope, Ugh.
Leslie Knope, I'm so glad we're leaving.
Leslie Knope, Wait.
Leslie Knope, You know what? I just had an amazing idea.
Ian, Just under the wire.
Leslie Knope," Oh, Ian, thank you so much."
Leslie Knope, It's great.
Leslie Knope," Now, throw it out."
Leslie Knope," I need a new one, and I need it in 20 minutes."
Leslie Knope, Look.
Leslie Knope," If you didn't wanna be on call 24/7 for emergencies, then you should not have gone into the high-stakes world of banner making!"
Donna Meagle,What the hell is all this about?
Ben Wyatt,You'll see.
Jerry Gergich," Well, I got to say, that was a heck of a lot of fun."
Choir, All my life--

Leslie Knope,Which brings us to 2005.
Leslie Knope,"The Circle Park renovation was complete, and a young man named Thomas Haverford was still two years away from getting hired."
Ron Swanson,"Perhaps we could skip ahead, and just hit the highlights?"
Leslie Knope,"I mean, I planned a comprehensive retrospective, but I guess I can just focus on the really important moments."
Leslie Knope,Ah!
Leslie Knope,The debate about getting a pod-based coffee machine.
Leslie Knope,Garry and I wrote a little musical number about that.
Leslie Knope,And it goes a little something like this.
April Ludgate,"Why can't we just quickly shake hands, pretend we liked each other, and get out of here?"
Ron Swanson,I'm all for that.
Leslie Knope,"No, April, Ron, we need to celebrate everything that we've done together as a group."
Leslie Knope,This is our last day here.
Leslie Knope,Who knows when we'll all be together like this again?
Extra,Excuse me.
Extra,Hi.
Extra,There's a swing in a park near my house that's been broken for about three months.
Extra,Is it possible to get that fixed?
Andy Dwyer,"""Anything is possible, if you follow your dreams."""
Andy Dwyer,Johnny Karate.
Donna Meagle,Except getting a swing fixed.
Donna Meagle,None of us actually work here anymore.
Donna Meagle,Come back in two hours when the office is open.
Extra,Thank you.
Leslie Knope,Wait.
Leslie Knope,"Actually, sir, we can help."
Leslie Knope,"We can, and we will."
Leslie Knope,"Because when we used to work here, helping people was our job."
Leslie Knope,Forget about these old stories.
Leslie Knope,Let's make a new one.
Leslie Knope,Let's fix the swing.
Leslie Knope,One last ride for the Parks and Rec gang.
Leslie Knope,Who's in?
All,Yeah!
Jerry Gergich,The vote was four to three Donna said to get rid of me But Ron was suspicious Because my coffee was delicious--
Tom Haverford,"Come on, Garry."
Tom Haverford,You're the mayor now.
Tom Haverford,Have some dignity.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"So, what is our first step on our quest to help this man?"
Leslie Knope,Does anyone remember?
Jerry Gergich,A Parks and Recreation equipment requisition form.
Leslie Knope,Correct!
Leslie Knope,Five points for Hufflepuff.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, everything is paperless now."
Ben Wyatt,And none of us has a login.
Ben Wyatt,So we can't access the computers.
Donna Meagle,Hang on.
Donna Meagle,I have one right here.
Donna Meagle,"Thanks to Leslie's scrapbook, ""Thanks Form the Memories""."
Leslie Knope,I knew those scrapbooks were going to come in handy.
Leslie Knope,You came through like you always do.
Leslie Knope,"God, I'm going to miss you."
Leslie Knope,"Your confidence, your joie de vivre."
Leslie Knope,That crazy story about you getting kicked out of En Vogue.
Donna Meagle,"Technically, I kicked them out."
Leslie Knope,When do you leave for Seattle?
Donna Meagle,Soon as I get my local real estate license.
Donna Meagle,"I'm married to a teacher, and I love the man, but I also love diamond watches."
Leslie Knope,"Well, whatever happens, I know that you are going to live an exciting and full life."
Donna Meagle,"3400 square feet, a beautiful view of Puget Sound, and if you look out this window, you can watch them build the new Space Haystack around the Space Needle."
Extra,Wow.
Extra,I can hardly see the needle anymore.
Donna Meagle,"I know, that's kind of the point."
Donna Meagle,"So, what are we thinking?"
Joe,Wow.
Joe,It sold in two hours?
Donna Meagle,You cannot beat the Seattle real estate market.
Donna Meagle,"I think it's all that coffee and legal marijuana, has people wanting to buy houses quickly and irrationally."
Joe,Mmm.
Donna Meagle,But the giant commission check has me thinking about…
Joe,Mmmhmm?
Donna Meagle,Donna Joe Adventure Quest.
Joe,Ooh!
Joe,Where are we going?
Joe,"Well, it can't beat last year."
Joe,"I mean, Middle Korea is so beautiful."
Donna Meagle,Here's my idea.
Donna Meagle,The Amazon.
Joe,Oh!
Donna Meagle,Three weeks of the best and most expensive places South America has to offer.
Joe,I love it.
Joe,"Honestly, with the way work is going, I just need this right now."
Joe,The school cut the math club.
Joe,And math.
Joe,They just don't teach math anymore.
Donna Meagle,Oh.
Donna Meagle,My poor little do-gooder teacher baby.
Donna Meagle,"Why don't we cuddle up on the couch, watch a movie, and then maybe later, I'll wear that little red thing?"
Joe,"Yes, the red thing."
Joe,"Here, let me get this."
Donna Meagle,Call Satan's Niece.
April Ludgate,"Hey, what do you want?"
Donna Meagle,And this is me DJing a boat party in Venezuela.
Donna Meagle,Kind of reminded me of the two weeks you and I spent there.
April Ludgate,"Oh, yeah."
April Ludgate,That happened.
Donna Meagle,"Yeah, it did."
Joe,April!
Joe,What are you doing here?
Donna Meagle,"Babe, have a seat."
Joe,What's going on?
Donna Meagle,"Recently, I was thinking, for the millionth time, how lucky I am to have found you."
Donna Meagle,"So, I've decided to treat yo' self."
Joe,You're going to buy me a bunch of leather handbags?
April Ludgate,Donna is going to take some of the money you usually use on your trips and establish an education program through the foundation I work for.
Donna Meagle,It's called Teach Yo' Self.
Donna Meagle,And you and the other teachers will get money for afterschool programs.
Donna Meagle,"For music, art, math, whatever you want."
Joe,"Baby, this is really generous."
Joe,But I love our trips.
Joe,"And honestly, it's your money."
Joe,You should spend it how you want.
Donna Meagle,This is what I want.
Donna Meagle,I've had a lot of adventures.
Donna Meagle,I single-handedly started that doorknockers earring trend.
Donna Meagle,I came in ninth in Italy's Got Talent.
Joe,Yeah.
Donna Meagle,I served on a NASCAR pit crew.
Donna Meagle,"I want a new kind of adventure, and I want to take it with you."
April Ludgate,"Okay, I feel like it's time for me to get out of here."
Craig Middlebrooks,What is this mess?
Craig Middlebrooks,Why are you all in my office?
Leslie Knope,We are on one last mission to help the people of Pawnee.
Ben Wyatt,"Craig, can you sign the requisition form?"
Ben Wyatt,It will speed things up.
Leslie Knope,"You know, Craig, when I first met you, I thought, ""There is a man who loves his job."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, wow, he's intense."""
Leslie Knope,"And then I thought, ""Oh, no, he's insane."""
Leslie Knope,"""That person is psychotic, and I need to call the police."""
Craig Middlebrooks,"Yeah, that's usually the way it goes."
Leslie Knope,But I just think you've come so far.
Leslie Knope,And I'm so glad that we are leaving the Parks Department in your hands.
Craig Middlebrooks,Funny though it's true Those silly things you do They only bring me Closer to you
Tom Haverford,"Nice crooning, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"The gentleman over by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, as you all know--"
Craig Middlebrooks,"Okay, fine."
Pastor,We are gathered here today to join Craig Middlebrooks and Typhoon Montalban in holy matrimony.
Craig Middlebrooks,I don't know about this.
Craig Middlebrooks,I'm very scared.
Typhoon,"Oh, just relax, you nervous nelly."
Craig Middlebrooks,You're right.
Craig Middlebrooks,"We love each other, and the tax break is substantial."
Pastor,Will the best man please present the rings?
Ron Swanson,"Good luck, you two."
Craig Middlebrooks,"Typhoon, my love, happy anniversary."
Craig Middlebrooks,Do you have any regrets?
Typhoon,Not one.
Typhoon,Not a single one.
Typhoon,Do you have any regrets?
Craig Middlebrooks,Are you kidding?
Craig Middlebrooks,Thousands!
Craig Middlebrooks,"Most recently, this trout!"
Leslie Knope,Okay!
Leslie Knope,"April and Andy, I need to file this."
Leslie Knope,Would anyone like to accompany me to the fourth floor?
April Ludgate,One last journey to the weirdest place on earth?
April Ludgate,Yes.
Andy Dwyer,Shotgun!
Leslie Knope,We're just taking the elevator.
Andy Dwyer,I get to push buttons.
Andy Dwyer,I called it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
April Ludgate,He called it.
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I know."
Leslie Knope,I heard.
Leslie Knope,Ethel Beavers.
Leslie Knope,"We need this filed, please."
Ethel Beavers,We've gone digital.
Ethel Beavers,"Get with the times, you Luddite."
April Ludgate,Man.
April Ludgate,"Of all the places in Pawnee, I'm going to miss the fourth floor the most."
April Ludgate,"The disturbing murals, the ominous lighting, the creepy people."
Kyle,"Hi, April."
Andy Dwyer,I'm going to miss the food in Pawnee.
Andy Dwyer,"Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut."
Andy Dwyer,"But most of all, I'm going to miss you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"Oh, Andy, all of those things, including me, will still be with you in Washington."
Andy Dwyer,That is a beautiful sentiment.
Leslie Knope,I just want to say that we are about to embark on an amazing adventure.
Leslie Knope,"And whatever happens, just know that Ben and I are always there for you."
April Ludgate,Mmm.
April Ludgate,"Agent Macklin, I need you."
April Ludgate,Some thieves are trying to steal the legendary Snakehole Sapphire.
Andy Dwyer,What the... No!
Andy Dwyer,That sapphire has the power to activate the Cuban Missile Crisis.
April Ludgate,"Damn it, Macklin, I love it when you take charge."
April Ludgate,"Make love to me, you fool!"
April Ludgate,You animal!
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
Andy Dwyer,"Raincheck that, all right?"
Andy Dwyer,They're here.
All,Trick or treat!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look at them!"
Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, you little monsters!"
Andy Dwyer,I love this.
Andy Dwyer,You guys are the best.
April Ludgate,"My love, we have to go."
April Ludgate,Just put all the candy in a bowl or something.
April Ludgate,What's wrong?
April Ludgate,Did you eat all the candy?
Andy Dwyer,No!
April Ludgate,Did you?
Andy Dwyer,"Yes, but that's not what's wrong."
Andy Dwyer,It's just... Seeing all those kids out there... Babe.
Andy Dwyer,"I want to put a babe in you, babe."
April Ludgate,"Andy, you know where I stand on this."
April Ludgate,"Yes, I would love all the awesome stuff my body would go through."
April Ludgate,"I mean, if all it meant was puking and getting weird stretch marks and veins everywhere, then sign me up."
April Ludgate,"But at the end, we've brought a child into the world?"
April Ludgate,That's disgusting.
Andy Dwyer,No.
Andy Dwyer,They wipe all of the disgusting stuff off of it immediately.
April Ludgate,We're going to be late for dinner.
Andy Dwyer,Okay.
April Ludgate,Let's go.
April Ludgate,Hey!
Ben Wyatt,Come on in.
Leslie Knope,Hey!
Leslie Knope,Always nice to see Janet Snakehole and Burt Macklin in the mix.
April Ludgate,What are you guys dressed as?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I'm Sandra Dee O'Connor."
Leslie Knope,Get it?
Leslie Knope,Sandra Dee plus Sandra Day O'Connor?
April Ludgate,Who's Sandra Dee?
Andy Dwyer,Who's Sandra Day O'Connor?
Leslie Knope,Forget it.
Ben Wyatt,"And I am the Lamplighter, a character from my new board game sequel, Cones of Dunshire, Winds of Tremorrah."
Ben Wyatt,"Gameplay Magazine called it ""punishingly intricate."""
Andy Dwyer,"Hey, where are the kids at?"
Andy Dwyer,I want to say hi and wrestle all three of them at once.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, they're trick-or-treating in Georgetown with some friends."
Ben Wyatt,It's just us grownups tonight.
Ben Wyatt,No kids at all.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Andy, why don't you give me a hand in the kitchen?"
Andy Dwyer,So?
Andy Dwyer,What do you need a hand with?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, I just thought you might want to talk."
Andy Dwyer,Whoa!
Andy Dwyer,"Dude, that's really slick."
Andy Dwyer,"Man, that's some secret agent stuff right there."
Ben Wyatt,"So, April's still on the fence about kids, huh?"
Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, and I'm freaking out, man."
Andy Dwyer,I want kids so bad.
Andy Dwyer,"You know, yesterday, I was at the park, and I saw this group of eight year olds laughing and playing and having a good time."
Andy Dwyer,I almost started crying.
Andy Dwyer,"Granted, I had just faceplanted on my rollerblades."
Andy Dwyer,That's what they were laughing at.
Ben Wyatt,Sure.
April Ludgate,"All right, go ahead."
Leslie Knope,What?
April Ludgate,You're going to lecture me about how Andy and I should have kids.
April Ludgate,"You're going to be like, ""They're so great."""
April Ludgate,"""They change your life."""
April Ludgate,"""And yes, they drive you nuts, but it's all worth it for the beauty and the majesty and the glory of their little faces in the morning."""
April Ludgate,"Blah, blah, blah and barf."
April Ludgate,You know why it's so unfair?
April Ludgate,Because you guys got so lucky.
April Ludgate,"You had sex one time and you had three kids and they're all, like, smart and great and healthy."
April Ludgate,"And now, your lives are perfect."
April Ludgate,But our life is pretty perfect already.
April Ludgate,And you know what?
April Ludgate,Kids act the opposite of their parents.
April Ludgate,That's why your kids are so cool.
April Ludgate,"But Andy and I are cool already, so our kids will be, like, really lame and weird."
April Ludgate,I'm sorry.
April Ludgate,I just don't know what to do.
April Ludgate,Please tell me what to do.
April Ludgate,What do I do?
Leslie Knope,It's not about trying to make your life perfect.
Leslie Knope,Nobody's lives are perfect.
Leslie Knope,"You have kids because you and Andy are a team, and you want to bring in some new team members."
April Ludgate,"So, you think we should?"
Leslie Knope,I don't know if you should have kids.
Leslie Knope,I really don't.
Leslie Knope,But I do like your team.
Dr. Saperstein,"All right, Ms. Ludgate."
Dr. Saperstein,We're getting close.
Andy Dwyer,"Babe, you look more beautiful right now than I have ever seen you."
Dr. Saperstein,Wow.
Dr. Saperstein,Just your luck that you're going into labor on Halloween.
Dr. Saperstein,Can I get a warm towel to get that makeup off?
April Ludgate,No!
April Ludgate,I want it on.
April Ludgate,That's the whole point.
April Ludgate,I put the makeup on after I went into labor.
Dr. Saperstein,Whatever blows your skirt up.
Dr. Saperstein,Okay.
Dr. Saperstein,You ready to push?
April Ludgate,"Wait, no, babe, my birth mix."
Andy Dwyer,Oh.
Music,He did the mash
Dr. Saperstein,Here comes a contraction.
Dr. Saperstein,Are you ready?
April Ludgate,"Okay, I'm ready."
April Ludgate,Let's do this.
Music,It was a graveyard smash He did the mash It caught on in a flash He did the mash He did the monster mash From the laboratory in the castle east
Andy Dwyer,Burt Macklin Junior?
April Ludgate,"Mmm, we need a Halloween angle."
April Ludgate,How about Demon Spawn Baby Satan Dwyer?
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I like that."
Andy Dwyer,Yeah.
Andy Dwyer,"Or maybe, Burt Snakehole Ludgate Karate Dracula Macklin Demon Jacko'Lantern Dwyer."
Andy Dwyer,We call him Jack for short.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Leslie Knope,Hi.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, I want to scream, but I don't want to wake up my godchild."
Leslie Knope,"I'm assuming it's my godchild, right?"
Leslie Knope,We can talk about it later.
Ben Wyatt,"Congrats, guys."
Ben Wyatt,"I know it came unexpectedly early, but pretty cool he was born in Pawnee."
Ben Wyatt,Where do I put these?
Ben Wyatt,"I have so many presents, it's weird."
Andy Dwyer,Yes!
Andy Dwyer,"Oh, for the baby?"
Andy Dwyer,Just put them over there.
Leslie Knope,What's his name?
April Ludgate,Jack.
Leslie Knope,That's good.
Leslie Knope,"Welcome to the team, little guy."
Ethel Beavers,Take this down to maintenance.
Leslie Knope,"I know just where to take it, Ethel."
Leslie Knope,And I know just the person who should accompany me.
Kyle,I'm a little busy right now.
Leslie Knope,"Not you, Kyle."
Leslie Knope,"How many times did you and I deliver a form to maintenance, just like this?"
Leslie Knope,"Oh, so many great conversations, bonding and mentoring moments."
Leslie Knope,It seems only right that we make this journey one final time.
Tom Haverford,"What was that, booboo?"
Leslie Knope,Nothing.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Ohhh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tommy T and Sexy Lexy Knope.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,What are you two bad Larrys up to?
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is our last day in Pawnee and we have one last problem to fix."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Hold up.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,You're leaving?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,For truth?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I am going to miss you so much.
Leslie Knope,What's going on?
Leslie Knope,You're not injured?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Uh, yeah, I'm injured."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I got a terminal case of ""get me to the front of the line at Six Flags!"""
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Shaboosh!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It's a winter wonderland!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I'm going to be so sad to see you go.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Will you do me one final kindness?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Will you pretend to be my wife for an insurance scam, but then we fall in love for real?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Also, can I have a pair of your gym socks?"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And don't worry.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It's not for anything weird.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,It's just a fetish I have.
Leslie Knope,Jean-Ralphio.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"Although I truly hope that I never see you again, I do wish you a long and happy life."
Extra,Today we say goodbye to Jean-Ralphio Saperstein.
Extra,"As per his last will and testament, we will now listen to his favorite song, Bend Over, by Lil Jon featuring Tyga."
Music,Bend over make your knees touch your elbows Bend over make your knees touch your elbows Whoo!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, okay, they bought it."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,They bought it.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Do you have the insurance money?
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"No doubt, no doubt."
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Let's hit it, bro."
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Time to start a casino in Uh, Tajikistan"
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,Tajikistan!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Talking about Tajikistan!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Shh, shh, shh."
Extra,Jean-Ralphio?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Go!
Mona-Lisa Saperstein,"Go, go, go, go!"
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Tajikistan is off!
Leslie Knope,So Tom and I have a swing to fix.
Leslie Knope,Let's go.
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Leslie?
Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I've always loved you.
Leslie Knope,I know.
Leslie Knope,"Oh, man, I forgot that maintenance was closed on Fridays."
Tom Haverford,What would our last ride be without one more bureaucratic snafu?
Tom Haverford,"Don't worry, booboo."
Tom Haverford,"Tommy will solve this problem, no sweat."
Leslie Knope,"Can I just say, Tom, you have accomplished so much, you have come so far, now you're so successful"
Tom Haverford,Don't forget well-dressed.
Leslie Knope,"Yes, and well-dressed."
Leslie Knope,I am so very proud of you.
Tom Haverford,"Thanks, Leslie."
Tom Haverford,"I'm proud of me, too."
Tom Haverford,"Nice crooning, buddy."
Tom Haverford,"Uh, the gentleman by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,"So, as you all know, Tom's Bistro has been presented with a huge expansion opportunity, and I don't want to make a decision until I hear from my senior advisory board."
Tom Haverford,"So, is this a good idea?"
Tom Haverford,Accounting Nerd.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm a congressman, Tom."
Ben Wyatt,Can you at least call me Ben?
Tom Haverford,"No can do, Accounting Nerd."
Tom Haverford,We all knew you before you were a big shot.
Tom Haverford,Let's keep the whining to a minimum.
Ben Wyatt,"Well, there are always going to be risks when you open new restaurants."
Ben Wyatt,But you've done your homework.
Ben Wyatt,All the numbers line up.
Ben Wyatt,"Side note, I would again strongly recommend adding calzones to the menu."
Tom Haverford,Ugh.
Tom Haverford,The worst.
Tom Haverford,Ron?
Ron Swanson,"It's a bold capitalistic gambit, son."
Ron Swanson,"But nothing ventured, nothing gained."
Tom Haverford,Regal Meagle?
Donna Meagle,Real estate is pretty cheap right now.
Donna Meagle,"If you're going to do it, this is a good time."
Tom Haverford,Okay.
Tom Haverford,I'm doing it.
Tom Haverford,"Over the next five years, there's going to be 20 Tom's Bistros across America."
Tom Haverford,"Look out, world."
Tom Haverford,Tommy's about to blow up.
Tom Haverford,"And blow up he did, but not in a good way."
Tom Haverford,He lost everything.
Tom Haverford,"Today, Tom Haverford is broke, destitute."
Tom Haverford,"And worst of all, swaggerless."
Lucy,"Tommy, you've got to stop watching this."
Tom Haverford,I can't tear myself away.
Tom Haverford,It's a whole documentary about my failures.
Lucy,That you made!
Tom Haverford,I had to.
Tom Haverford,I have to remember every tiny awful aspect of this.
Tom Haverford,"I lost everything, Lucy."
Tom Haverford,"The franchises, most of my money-- I had to sell my pocket square collection!"
Tom Haverford,What are people's eyes going to be drawn to?
Lucy,"Look, you had a tough break."
Lucy,"The stock market tanked, credit dried up."
Lucy,Who could have predicted that the country would run out of beef?
Lucy,You've just got to move on.
Tom Haverford,"That's the problem, though."
Tom Haverford,"I've gone bust in the past, but it was because I did something reckless."
Tom Haverford,"This time, I was smart and careful, and I still went broke."
Tom Haverford,What do I do now?
Lucy,"Well, you and I are going to be fine."
Lucy,And you'll come up with a new idea.
Lucy,You always do.
Tom Haverford,I once started an entertainment company. It failed in four months.
Tom Haverford,I opened a clothing rental store.
Tom Haverford,I built a restaurant empire.
Tom Haverford,They all failed.
Tom Haverford,But the story of America isn't about second or third chances.
Tom Haverford,"It's about fourth, fifth, sixth, twentieth, fiftieth chances."
Tom Haverford,That's how long it took me to get where I am today.
Tom Haverford,"Best selling author of Failure, An American Success Story."
Tom Haverford,"As you know if you've read the book, I've outlined seven different types of successful people."
Tom Haverford,You can be an Andy.
Tom Haverford,An April.
Tom Haverford,A Ben.
Tom Haverford,A Leslie.
Tom Haverford,A Ron.
Tom Haverford,A Donna.
Tom Haverford,Or my personal favorite.
Tom Haverford,A Tom.
Tom Haverford,But what do we definitely not want to be?
All,A Garry!
Tom Haverford,That's right.
Tom Haverford,Do not be a Garry.
Jerry Gergich,He's talking about me.
Leslie Knope,Hey.
Tom Haverford,Hey!
Tom Haverford,"Thanks so much for coming, guys."
Leslie Knope,Are you kidding?
Leslie Knope,"Tom, this is incredible."
Leslie Knope,"A bestselling book, a 40 city tour."
Tom Haverford,"Well, I couldn't have done it without you."
Leslie Knope,"Well, the book is called Failure."
Leslie Knope,I don't know how to take that.
Tom Haverford,I'm serious.
Tom Haverford,You guys have always supported me.
Tom Haverford,"Here, I inscribed you a copy."
Ben Wyatt,"""When I think of success, I think of you."""
Ben Wyatt,"""You are a true inspiration to me."""
Ben Wyatt,"""I love you."""
Ben Wyatt,Tom Haverford.
Tom Haverford,"Oh, sorry, that's actually for Kendrick Lamar."
Tom Haverford,Here's yours.
Leslie Knope,"""Best wishes."""
Tom Haverford,And I mean every word of it.
Leslie Knope,"So, how are we going to fix this swing?"
Leslie Knope,Hold a public forum?
Leslie Knope,Have a rally?
Leslie Knope,Smash that door and do some looting?
Tom Haverford,"Actually, I think there's a simpler solution."
Tom Haverford,We just need the help of the most powerful man in Pawnee.
Jerry Gergich,"Jim, how the heck are you?"
Jerry Gergich,"Yeah, look, I hate to bother you, but I'm here with my two best friends, Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford."
Leslie Knope,Shh.
Jerry Gergich,And we need the first floor maintenance room open.
Jerry Gergich,Mmm.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, great."
Jerry Gergich,And best to Louise and the girls.
Jerry Gergich,"Okay, bye bye."
Jerry Gergich,You guys are all set.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Mayor Gergich."
Leslie Knope,You really saved our butts.
Leslie Knope,I am so happy that you get to be mayor.
Leslie Knope,Are you enjoying yourself?
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, are you kidding me?"
Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I know that this is purely ceremonial and it will be over in just a couple of weeks, but I just don't know how my life could get any better than this."
Perd Hapley,"In a turn of events both shocking and unexpected, interim mayor Garry Gergich was officially elected today, thanks to a massive write-in campaign."
Perd Hapley,"Mayor Gergich, what are your plans for your first actual term?"
Jerry Gergich,"Oh, geez."
Jerry Gergich,"Uh, you know what, I have no idea, Perd."
Jerry Gergich,"I mean, this is so crazy."
Jerry Gergich,"I just hope I do a good job, and I promise I'm going to try my best."
Jerry Gergich,"And faithfully serve the people of Pawnee, Indiana."
Brandi Maxxxx,"As President of City Council, I, Councilwoman Brandi Maxxxx, star of more than 11,000 adult films in the last two years, officially declare Garry Gergich Mayor of Pawnee, Indiana, for the fourth time."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Pawnee!"
Morris,"Okay, great."
Morris,"Garry Gergich, you are now mayor, again, for the tenth time, proving conclusively that in these corporate states of America, it's the entrenched powers who hold all the cards."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Councilman Morris."
Jerry Gergich,"Thank you, Pawnee!"
Gayle Gergich,"Happy birthday, my sweet, sweet husband."
Gayle Gergich,We all love you so much.
Jerry Gergich,I have had the perfect life.
Jerry Gergich,I have had the perfect marriage.
Gayle Gergich,Oh.
Jerry Gergich,The perfect children and the perfect grandchildren and great grandchildren.
Jerry Gergich,And I just want you to know how much I love you.
Gayle Gergich,Okay.
Gayle Gergich,"Come on, everybody."
Gayle Gergich,"Say ""Gergich."""
All,Gergich!
Extra,"Mayor Garry Gergich died peacefully, in his sleep, on his 100th birthday, holding the hand of his beloved wife, Gayle."
Ben Wyatt,"Man, Gayle looks amazing."
Leslie Knope,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
Extra,"He will now be given the Indiana Notary Society's highest honor, the 21 Stamp Salute."
Leslie Knope,"Rest in peace, friend."
Ben Wyatt,They spelled his name wrong on the tombstone.
Leslie Knope,Close enough.
Ben Wyatt,Eh.
Extra,It's time to go.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,How's this for a headline?
Leslie Knope,"""Still Swinging: Parks Gang Reunites for One Last Bang."""
Shauna Malwae-Tweep,That's a little dirty.
Leslie Knope,"Well, it's a headline, Shauna."
Leslie Knope,Sex sells.
Ron Swanson,Knope.
Ron Swanson,Make yourself useful and hand me that crescent wrench.
Leslie Knope,"Well, Not bad craftsmanship, Ron."
Ron Swanson,It is perfect craftsmanship.
Ron Swanson,I calculate the cost of my labor at 38 dollars.
Ron Swanson,I can send the bill to you?
Leslie Knope,"So, you think you're going to stick around Pawnee?"
Ron Swanson,"Oh, I imagine so."
Ron Swanson,"Not sure where I would go, really."
Leslie Knope,"Well, we're going to come back here a lot."
Leslie Knope,You know what they say.
Leslie Knope,Don't be a stranger.
Trevor Nelson,"Despite the recent financial crisis, Very Good Building Company will finish fiscal year 2022 in excellent financial shape, thanks in large part to the stewardship of your chairman, Ron Swanson."
Trevor Nelson,"Mr. Chairman, would you like to say a few words?"
Ron Swanson,I resign as chairman.
Ron Swanson,Effective immediately.
Trevor Nelson,"Uh, would you like to explain why?"
Ron Swanson,No.
Don Swanson,Should we discuss your retirement package?
Ron Swanson,Just give me whatever the Board thinks is fair.
Don Swanson,Agreed.
Vaughn Swanson,Best of luck.
Ron Swanson,"Don't get emotional, Vaughn."
Ron Swanson,You're embarrassing yourself.
Trevor Nelson,What just happened?
Leslie Knope,"Ron, your family is beautiful."
Ron Swanson,They are a handsome bunch.
Ron Swanson,"Diane and I are especially proud, because Ivy was just accepted at Stanford University."
Leslie Knope,Wow.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah?
Ben Wyatt,It's going to cost an arm and a leg.
Ben Wyatt,Did you take my advice?
Ron Swanson,I did.
Ron Swanson,Thank you again.
Ron Swanson,"I sold some of my gold, and officially diversified my portfolio."
Extra,Congratulations.
Extra,You now own 51% of the Lagavulin Distillery.
Ron Swanson,Pleasure doing business with you.
Extra,And with you.
Ron Swanson,Slainte.
All,Slainte.
Leslie Knope,"So, Ron, what brings you here?"
Ron Swanson,I am at something of a personal crossroads.
Leslie Knope,Yes!
Leslie Knope,I love personal crossroads.
Ron Swanson,"I once made the mistake of not talking to you at such a moment, and I do not intend to repeat that error."
Leslie Knope,"Well, let's take a walk."
Leslie Knope,There's a cute little park nearby.
Ron Swanson,"I suppose I had simply accomplished everything I wanted to, and there seemed to be little point in continuing."
Leslie Knope,"So, what do you want to do now?"
Ron Swanson,"Well, that's the problem."
Ron Swanson,I am not sure.
Ron Swanson,My kids are growing up.
Ron Swanson,My days in an office feel like a waste.
Ron Swanson,I would like to turn my attention to something that would make me feel useful.
Ron Swanson,"But for the life of me, I cannot figure out what."
Ron Swanson,"And there are not many people-- I mean, we were workplace proximity acquaintances for many years."
Ron Swanson,"And so, I thought I thought, maybe…"
Leslie Knope,"Say no more, you big softie."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to spend every waking moment trying to figure this out for you.
Leslie Knope,You want to stay for dinner?
Leslie Knope,We're having steak.
Ron Swanson,Mmm.
Leslie Knope,But we're also hosting several members of the House Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs.
Ron Swanson,"I'll take that steak to go, please and thank you."
Leslie Knope,"Hey, there you are."
Leslie Knope,Thanks for meeting me here.
Ron Swanson,"Well, if you'd held them here instead of that conference room, I would have come to more meetings."
Ron Swanson,"I've got to tell you, Leslie."
Ron Swanson,Establishing this national park right next to Pawnee is quite an accomplishment.
Ron Swanson,This is a fine piece of land you saved.
Leslie Knope,"Thank you, Ron."
Leslie Knope,You want to run it?
Leslie Knope,"The superintendent of Bryce Canyon retired, and I convinced the superintendent of this park to transfer, shuffled a few things around."
Leslie Knope,"The point is, someone needs to take care of this place now."
Leslie Knope,Thought it should be you.
Ron Swanson,"I... Well, first of all, I would be working for the federal government--"
Leslie Knope,Your job would be to walk around the land alone.
Leslie Knope,You'd live in the same town you've always lived in.
Leslie Knope,"You'd work outside, you'd talk to bears."
Leslie Knope,Next argument.
Ron Swanson,"Well, there must be dozens of people gunning for this job."
Ron Swanson,I wouldn't want you to ruffle any feathers.
Ron Swanson,Am I even qualified?
Leslie Knope,"Well, a few people might be annoyed."
Leslie Knope,But they'll get over it.
Leslie Knope,"And as far as your qualifications, you're Ron Swanson."
Leslie Knope,Stop being a dummy and accept.
Ron Swanson,When do I start?
Leslie Knope,"Oh, today."
Leslie Knope,I already accepted for you.
Leslie Knope,I still remember how to forge your signature.
Leslie Knope,Let's go meet your staff.
Leslie Knope,"Pawnee National Park Rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new superintendent and boss."
Ron Swanson,Rangers.
Ron Swanson,My name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.
Ron Swanson,"Your job, and mine, is to walk this land and make sure no one harms it."
Ron Swanson,"If you show up on time, speak honestly, and treat everyone with fairness, we will get along just fine."
Ron Swanson,"Though hopefully not too fine, as I am not looking for any new friends."
Ron Swanson,End of speech.
Leslie Knope,Well said.
Ron Swanson,"Thank you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,"You're welcome, Ron."
Ron Swanson,Okay.
Ron Swanson,Time to go to work.
Music,"Laugh with me, buddy Jest with me, buddy Don't let her get the best of me, buddy Don't ever let me start feeling lonely"
Ron Swanson,"Well, I have to make a couple more adjustments."
Leslie Knope,"Babe, I don't want to seem dramatic, but I have just reconsidered every decision that we have made over the last year and I think we need to stay in Pawnee forever."
Ben Wyatt,I know.
Ben Wyatt,But we have to pick up the kids and we have a flight to catch.
Leslie Knope,But when is this group of people ever going to be all together again?
Leslie Knope,That's all I want.
Leslie Knope,All of these people in the same place at the same time.
Ben Wyatt,It will happen.
Ben Wyatt,Someday.
Leslie Knope,What's going to happen between now and then?
Ben Wyatt,A lot.
Ben Wyatt,And it's all going to be great.
Leslie Knope,You promise?
Ben Wyatt,I promise.
Ben Wyatt,This is a nice house.
Leslie Knope,You say that every time we're here.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm just trying to distract you, so you don't have a nervous breakdown."
Leslie Knope,I think I am past that point.
Leslie Knope,You don't have to worry about me anymore.
Joe Biden,"Hey, folks."
Joe Biden,Welcome back.
Joe Biden,Great to have so many good friends and colleagues.
Joe Biden,We're looking forward to a great conversation and a good dinner.
Jill Biden,"As usual, there is only one rule."
Jill Biden,No shop talk.
Jill Biden,"So, if you want to discuss politics, you're going to have to wait until after dinner."
Jill Biden,"I'm looking at you, Leslie."
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,"Well, as long as we get to play charades later."
Joe Biden,Okay.
Joe Biden,"Last time we played charades, she spent three and a half hours here."
Jill Biden,You're just mad because you lost.
Joe Biden,"Oh, come on."
Leslie Knope,"Damn, that food was good."
Leslie Knope,I've said it before and I'll say it again.
Leslie Knope,Joe Biden knows his way around a seafood risotto.
Extra,You've said that before?
Leslie Knope,"Anyway, the point is, yes, I do like working at Interior."
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,But I'm always looking for new challenges.
Leslie Knope,Why do you ask?
Extra,There's a rumor the Governor of Indiana isn't going to run again.
Extra,And my friends at the DNC are very interested in you as a candidate.
Leslie Knope,For governor of Indiana?
Extra,Mmmhmm.
Leslie Knope,Someone's been reading my kindergarten dream journal.
Extra,"So, what do you think?"
Extra,I'll call you next week and we can talk about it?
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Great.
Leslie Knope,"Well, this is exciting."
Leslie Knope,I'm going to take this energy and I'm going to go crush Joe Biden in charades.
Leslie Knope,Dr. Jill?
Leslie Knope,Let's pick teams.
Jennifer Barkley,Oh.
Jennifer Barkley,Move.
Jennifer Barkley,Need the congressman.
Jennifer Barkley,This is time sensitive.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Jen, I didn't know you were here."
Jennifer Barkley,I'm everywhere.
Jennifer Barkley,You want to be governor of Indiana?
Ben Wyatt,What?
Jennifer Barkley,Colquitt is not going to run again.
Jennifer Barkley,"It's a rumor for now, but my gut says it's for real."
Jennifer Barkley,You're the perfect candidate.
Jennifer Barkley,"Local hero, state government experience."
Jennifer Barkley,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Jennifer Barkley,"I mean, the only potential problem is that devastatingly nerdy Cones of Dunshire thing."
Ben Wyatt,"Uh, that's a problem?"
Jennifer Barkley,Mmm.
Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, but it's the ninth highest selling multiplayer figurine based strategy fantasy sequel game in history."
Ben Wyatt,Please don't bail on me because of what just happened.
Leslie Knope,So I had a pretty interesting conversation with Janet from the DNC tonight.
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah?"
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"She said that Governor Colquitt might be stepping down, and the DNC thinks that I should run for governor."
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."
Ben Wyatt,That kind of sucks.
Leslie Knope,Really?
Leslie Knope,Why?
Ben Wyatt,"No, I mean, that's amazing."
Ben Wyatt,"It's just, Jen Barkley kind of approached me about running."
Leslie Knope,Oh!
Leslie Knope,Oh.
Leslie Knope,"Well, I mean, obviously…"
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Ben Wyatt,Yeah.
Ben Wyatt,"No, no."
Ben Wyatt,"I mean, obviously."
Leslie Knope,Yeah.
Leslie Knope,"I mean, obviously, we…"
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Pros of you running for governor.
Leslie Knope,You would be a great governor.
Leslie Knope,We could make Pawnee our home base.
Leslie Knope,The kids could go to school in Pawnee.
Leslie Knope,And it would be a huge career move for you.
Leslie Knope,The pros of me running for governor are the same thing.
Leslie Knope,It's the same list.
Ben Wyatt,Right.
Leslie Knope,The only con of you running would be that I don't get to run.
Leslie Knope,And vice versa.
Ben Wyatt,Good.
Ben Wyatt,"So, we've solved it."
Leslie Knope,Look.
Leslie Knope,We're going back to Pawnee in a week.
Leslie Knope,Why don't we just talk about it after that?
Ben Wyatt,Good idea.
Ben Wyatt,"Hey, maybe we can drop by the old stomping grounds."
Ben Wyatt,See how the Parks Department has changed.
Leslie Knope,I love it.
Leslie Knope,Okay.
Leslie Knope,Are you ready?
Leslie Knope,"No, but we don't have a choice, do we?"
Leslie Knope,Kids!
Leslie Knope,Dinner!
Kid,"Hey, I'm going to eat in my room because I have to study."
Kid,Can we go to Bobby's house to watch the game?
Kid,Have you finished your homework?
Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't forget"
Kid,"Bye, Dad."
Kid,"Bye, Mom."
Ben Wyatt,Bye.
Leslie Knope,Don't forget your ice skates.
Leslie Knope,You have a lesson tomorrow.
Kid,"Bye, Mom."
Kid,"Bye, Dad."
Ben Wyatt,Bye.
Ben Wyatt,Want some broccoli?
Leslie Knope,Ugh!
Leslie Knope,No.
Leslie Knope,"You know, now that I'm here, it's giving me an idea about this governor thing."
Leslie Knope,Maybe we need fresh eyes.
Leslie Knope,"You know, other people to weigh in."
Leslie Knope,We should talk to Ron.
Leslie Knope,Or Tom.
Leslie Knope,Or April.
Leslie Knope,Or Donna.
Leslie Knope,"Or Andy, even."
Leslie Knope,"Sometimes, he can be wise."
Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, good idea."
Ben Wyatt,Let's call them.
Ben Wyatt,Or you know what else we could do?
Ben Wyatt,Just talk to them in person.
Andy Dwyer,Surprise!
Leslie Knope,"Oh, wow."
Ben Wyatt,"It's what you wanted, right?"
Ben Wyatt,"Everyone in the same room, at the same time."
Leslie Knope,I can't believe you.
Leslie Knope,We're all here together in the same room.
Leslie Knope,In this room.
Leslie Knope,I don't think I could be happier right now.
Ben Wyatt,Want to bet?
Ann Perkins, Hi.
Leslie Knope," Oh, Ann's here."
Leslie Knope, Ann.
Leslie Knope, Ann's here.
Ben Wyatt, Hey.
Chris Traeger," Hey, buddy."
Ben Wyatt, How are you doing?
Chris Traeger,Good.
Leslie Knope," You guys, Ann's here."
Ben Wyatt, Should we move away from here?
Chris Traeger,Yeah.
Chris Traeger," Yeah, this could go on for some time."
Leslie Knope, Aw.
Leslie Knope," Your hair looks amazing, by the way."
Leslie Knope, You look like a cartoon princess.
Ann Perkins," Oh, thank you."
Ann Perkins, It's from the pills I was telling you about.
Leslie Knope," I took some of those, but I don't know, they didn't do anything and they kind of upset my stomach."
Ann Perkins," No, you're supposed to crack them and leave them on your hair overnight."
Ann Perkins, Not eat them.
Leslie Knope," Oh, no."
Leslie Knope," Well, it's confusing, because they're delicious."
Tom Haverford," Because my first book was such a smash, I had to come up with a new angle for the follow-up."
Tom Haverford," Then, it hit me, Failure 2.0: Failing to Fail."
Donna Meagle, Love it.
Tom Haverford, How's everything? You properly treating yo' self out there in Seattle?
Donna Meagle,In a manner of speaking.
Donna Meagle, Joe and I spend most of our time on the foundation.
Tom Haverford, I can't believe you went non-profit.
Tom Haverford," I mean, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you have betrayed me and everything we stand for."
Tom Haverford, You've changed.
Donna Meagle, Maybe you're right.
Donna Meagle," By the way, what time is it? Oh, it looks like it's half past spla-dow!"
Tom Haverford,What? I take it all back.
Tom Haverford, That's a lot of diamonds.
Tom Haverford," Gimme, gimme, gimme."
April Ludgate," Hey, Oliver."
April Ludgate," Hey, Leslie."
April Ludgate," Hello, Ann."
Ann Perkins," Hi, April."
April Ludgate," Your kids are, like, surprisingly awesome."
Ann Perkins, Thank you.
April Ludgate," Did you use an egg donor, or give Chris a hall pass for a night?"
Ann Perkins,"Once again, they are my biological children."
April Ludgate," Once again, I don't believe you."
Leslie Knope," Ann, you rainbow-infused space unicorn."
Leslie Knope," Ann, you beautiful, sassy mannequin come to life."
Leslie Knope," Ann, you opalescent tree shark."
Chris Traeger," Leslie, you are the master of the metaphor."
Leslie Knope, Oh.
Chris Traeger, I recently compared her to a nutrient-rich chia seed.
Leslie Knope, What's that thing on your wrist?
Chris Traeger,Oh!
Extra,You are extremely healthy.
Chris Traeger, I do that literally 50 times a day.
Leslie Knope,Aren't you afraid that thing might give you cancer?
Chris Traeger,"Well, I am now."
Andy Dwyer," Well, there he is."
Andy Dwyer, Chip Traeger.
Andy Dwyer, You old son of a gun.
Chris Traeger," Andy, it's Chris."
Andy Dwyer, Is it? Huh.
Ron Swanson," Hello, Jack."
Ron Swanson, Ron Swanson.
Ron Swanson, Strong handshake.
Ron Swanson," Well done, you two."
Andy Dwyer, Thank you.
Donna Meagle," So, are you going to have another one?"
April Ludgate,Um Shh.
Andy Dwyer, Shh.
Andy Dwyer, 'Cause 'Cause he's sleeping? How can you tell?
Ben Wyatt,"Oh, it's a common misconception that the Oculus holds all of the power."
Ben Wyatt, It's actually the Lamplighter.
Leslie Knope, Ann.
Leslie Knope," Oh, my God."
Leslie Knope, It's happening! It's totally happening.
Leslie Knope, Our kids are falling in love.
Ann Perkins, This is good.
Ann Perkins," Okay, remember."
Ann Perkins," If this is ever going to work, we have to pretend to disapprove."
Leslie Knope, Yeah.
Leslie Knope, Right.
Leslie Knope, Good call.
Leslie Knope, Hey!
Ann Perkins,"Leslie, no."
Leslie Knope, Oh.
Leslie Knope, Who cares?
Chris Traeger,"Ann Arbor, Michigan, is literally the greatest city that I have ever lived in."
Chris Traeger, But Pawnee is better.
Chris Traeger," So, we're moving back."
Ben Wyatt, That's great.
Chris Traeger, Yeah.
Chris Traeger, I'm going to run admissions at Indiana.
Chris Traeger, I'm trading Wolverines for Hoosiers.
Ron Swanson," Well, you're getting the better end of that deal."
Ron Swanson, Tom.
Ron Swanson, I took the quiz in your book about what kind of person I am.
Ron Swanson, I'm a Ron.
Tom Haverford," Ha! I'm usually a Tom, but sometimes, I'm a Donna."
Ben Wyatt," Last time I took it, I was a Tom."
Tom Haverford, What? No.
Tom Haverford," No, no, no! Take it again."
Tom Haverford, I've got to go recalibrate the quiz.
Ben Wyatt," So, did anyone have any insights on our ""running for governor"" situation?"
Leslie Knope,"I've been so busy catching up with everyone, I haven't had a chance to ask them."
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, me neither."
Leslie Knope," Okay, here's what I think."
Leslie Knope, I hate when we're on opposite sides.
Leslie Knope, It stinks.
Leslie Knope," Plus, if one of us runs, it doesn't mean we're going to win."
Ben Wyatt, Right.
Ben Wyatt, And it's not like this is the only career option for either of us.
Ben Wyatt," So, all that matters is that we are good."
Leslie Knope, Right.
Leslie Knope, Which is why I have an idea.
Leslie Knope, I think we should flip a coin.
Leslie Knope, I mean it.
Leslie Knope, Let's literally flip a coin.
Leslie Knope, Because whoever runs is going to do a great job.
Leslie Knope," And whoever doesn't run is going to be right alongside the other one, offering advice and support and whatever they need."
Leslie Knope," So, it doesn't matter."
Leslie Knope, So let's flip a coin.
Ben Wyatt, Okay.
Ben Wyatt," You, Leslie Knope, the queen of planning and binders and pro and con lists."
Ben Wyatt, You want to leave this to chance?
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope," Because whatever's next, you and I are in it together."
Leslie Knope," So, let's go tell everybody."
Leslie Knope," And they can participate and they can sign the coin and then, you know, the coin will eventually make its way into the Smithsonian."
Leslie Knope," Okay, everybody, gather around! First of all, I just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your children here, it's like It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America."
Leslie Knope," And secondly, Ben and I have an announcement."
Ben Wyatt, Leslie is running for governor of Indiana.
All, What?
Ron Swanson,"Bully for you, Knope."
April Ludgate, That's amazing.
Ben Wyatt," Yeah, she got approached by the DNC and they think she has a great shot to win."
Ben Wyatt," Indiana native, supremely qualified, and she wrote that she wanted to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal."
Ben Wyatt,Just makes sense.
Leslie Knope," So, I'm running for governor."
Leslie Knope," Ben is going to be running my campaign, because he's a super genius and he's got a tight, compact little body like an Italian sports car."
Leslie Knope," But right now, I'd like to make a toast."
Leslie Knope," When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better."
Leslie Knope, That's what public service is all about.
Leslie Knope," Small, incremental change, every day."
Leslie Knope," Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, the best prize that life has to offer is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."""
Leslie Knope,And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love.
Leslie Knope," I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana."
Leslie Knope," I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor."
Leslie Knope," And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me."
Leslie Knope," Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work."
Leslie Knope, Not to say that public service isn't sexy.
Leslie Knope, Because it definitely is.
Leslie Knope, But that's not why we do it.
Leslie Knope," We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love."
Leslie Knope," So, I thank those people who have walked with me, and I thank you for this honor."
Leslie Knope," Now, go find your team, and get to work."
Extra," In addition to Governor Knope's honorary doctorate from the School of Public Policy, in recognition of all she has done for the people of Indiana, the campus library will henceforth bear her name."
Leslie Knope, A [bleep] library?
Ron Swanson,"Yeah, that should do it."
Ron Swanson, The swing is fixed!
Leslie Knope,"Well, there you have it, sir."
Leslie Knope, Another problem solved by the hard work of dedicated public servants.
Extra," Okay, great."
Extra, Bye.
Leslie Knope," Yeah, that's about right."
Leslie Knope, Okay.
Leslie Knope, Well.
Jerry Gergich, Hang on.
Jerry Gergich," Gayle made me promise to get a quick picture, just for old times' sake."
Leslie Knope, Good idea! Garry had a good idea.
Tom Haverford, Ugh.
Tom Haverford, The lighting is all wrong.
Tom Haverford, I'm going to send you a glamor shot.
Tom Haverford, Just photoshop me in later.
April Ludgate," I'm not going to show up in that picture anyway, because I'm a vampire."
Andy Dwyer," Hey, babe, for this picture, should I be Burt Macklin, Johnny Karate, or my new character, Sergeant Thunderfist, M.D.?"
April Ludgate,Where did you get that?
Andy Dwyer,Found it in the sandbox.
April Ludgate, Ew.
Donna Meagle, Go Macklin.
Donna Meagle, Macklin's the hottest.
Ron Swanson, Get on with it.
Ron Swanson, I can't hold this smile forever.
Ron Swanson, I look ridiculous.
Jerry Gergich," Okay, hang on."
Jerry Gergich, Okay.
Ben Wyatt," You ready, babe?"
Leslie Knope,Yes.
Leslie Knope, I'm ready.
Extra, That is a series wrap on Parks and Recreation.
