""Oh.",The government.,The government stinks.,"""The lines are too long at the DMV.",""" But now things have changed.",People need our help.,And it feels good to be needed.,Could you put your arms to your side?,Wait And that might help you slide down a little easier.,We don't Do you want to come this way?,Uhuh.,"Okay, we're gonna need you to get out.",Can you please go away?,Get out of the slide.,Okay?,You're Can you please go away?,Here we go!,"Okay, wake up.",Here we go.,Out of the slide.,"LESLIE You know, government isn't just a boys' club anymore.",Women are everywhere.,It's a great time to be a woman in politics.,"Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, me, Nancy Pelosi.",We did it!,"You know, I like to tell people, you know, ""Get on board and buckle up, ""because my ride's gonna be a big one.",""" And if you get motion sickness, you know, put your head between your knees 'cause Leslie Knope's stopping for no one.",Tonight is our next monthly community outreach public forum.,And that is tonight.,That is tonight.,Right.,Leslie will be running it.,And we need one more.,Who wants in?,Tom.,Fine.,LESLIE This is a great thing for you guys to see.,This is where the rubber of government meets the road of actual human beings.,"When I go through these doors, I need to be on.",Like the White House Press Secretary.,Are you ready?,Yeah.,Okay.,Here we go.,It's locked.,Okay.,Here we go.,Thank you so much for coming.,What an amazing turnout.,My name is Leslie Knope.,"I am the deputy director of the Parks and Recreation Department, and tonight we're gonna be taking some of your questions as Hello?",We're having a meeting in here.,Does anybody have any questions about permits?,"So, take two.","I'm Leslie Knope, and with me is department member Tom Haverford.","We are here to answer any and all of your questions, so fire away.","Well, it's a great day, because last month they put me in jail.",That's right.,The head of the police is a ninthdegree Mason.,But the music is so loud.,"Stop the graffiti, please.",Please.,I don't like obscenities just as much as you don't like them.,"No, it drives me crazy.",I have kids.,Right.,"But I've got my little threeyearold, I'm going through the park and someone's like, ""Hey my "" And the guy's, ""You my, you head.",""" These people are members of a community that care about where they live, so what I hear when I'm being yelled at is people caring loudly at me.","Now, I have a few things I want to say about Laura Linney.","Thank you so much, Barry.",Always great to have you here.,Anyone else who would like to contribute?,Hi.,"Hi, hi.",Hi.,I'm Ann Perkins.,"I'm a nurse, and frankly, I don't really care for politics, but I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.",Excellent.,That sounds like a good idea.,Tell us about that.,"No, it's a problem.",It almost killed my boyfriend.,Oh.,Yeah.,"There's a lot nearby my house, and a developer dug out a basement for some condos, and then they went bankrupt, so there's just this giant pit, and it's been there for almost a year.","Twelve months, yes.",Go on.,"Yeah, and my boyfriend, who is a musician, actually, I support him, but anyway, he fell in and broke both his legs.","Ann, let me speak with you for a minute.","So, your boyfriend fell down into this pit, right?",Yes.,"And, this guy, is it pretty serious?",Are you guys living together?,Yes.,"Wow, I'm sure this must be really tough for you.","You know, just, this guy, sounds like he didn't have a lot going on for him to start with, and now both legs broken.",He's just weak.,You have to take care of him.,You probably feel like you need to move on.,"What does this Just become more adventurous in relationships with your body, just in Are you actually hitting on me right now?",Oh.,Oh.,"God, no.",I'm not hitting on you.,I'm actually married.,"I'm just an open person, and I like connecting with people.","I'm, you know, very comfortable around women, attractive women.",I've spent a lot of time with them.,And I just I don't know.,I feel like we might be taking up too much of the forum's time.,Maybe we can just exchange numbers.,"You know, maybe go away one weekend and just kind of talk about this.",Look I'd love to do it.,"The bottom line is I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and nobody's done anything, and it's ugly, and it's dangerous, and it's governmentowned, and you need to do something about it.",Okay.,I'll do something about it.,Really?,"Yes, we I will help you.",Is that a promise?,It's more than a promise.,It's a pinky promise.,"I pinky promise all of you that I will help, and I will go to that location tomorrow, and we will fill in that pit, and then when that's done, we're gonna put a park on the land.",Okay.,"LESLIE Well, I've worked at the Parks Department for six years, and I've handled a lot of things that I'm proud of.","Recently, I led a citywide drive to disinfect the sandbox sand after we had those problems with the cats.","But this pit, the chance to build a whole new park from scratch, this could be my Hoover Dam.","No, that sounds great.","Problem is, anything over $25 I have to report, so maybe give my wife a call and give her the suits, and then if they don't fit her, maybe she'll give them to me.",Morning.,"All right, Mr.",Mayor.,That sounds good.,I'll see you on Saturday for the Ultimate Frisbee game.,Bye.,"Leslie, hello.",You were talking to the mayor?,"Yep, we were just rapping about some things.",Tom and I work really well together.,We're both outsiders.,"I'm a woman, he's a I think he's a Libyan.","I am from Bennettsville, South Carolina.",I am what you might call a redneck.,"Okay, brainstorm.",How do we make this park happen?,Let's go to the city council directly and ask them to put up the money.,"No, parks are not a priority.",I need more firepower.,I need bigger guns.,You know what I need to do?,Form a committee.,Right?,"Yeah, that could work.","Yeah, 'cause committees are power, and committees make things happen.",Committees are the lifeblood of our democratic system.,That's really good.,Write that down.,Yep.,"From time to time, when I think of an eloquent saying or a phrase, I have Tom write it down.",He's collecting them for my memoirs.,Here's Leslie's quote from Wednesday.,"Okay, read it back to me.","Um ""Committees cover our democracy with blood.",""" Hmm.",Sounded better when I said it.,"It's still good, though.","Okay, I have an idea.",What about bringing Mark on board?,Which Mark?,Which Mark?,Mark Brendanawicz.,Which Mark?,"Well, if you want something done in this town, you call Mark Brendanawicz because, you know, he's a city planner, but he's more than that.",He's kind of like a fixer.,He fixes things.,"He's a smart, capable guy.",He just He knows where the bodies are buried.,"What's up, Brendanawicz?",You crazy old Polish person.,"LESLIE City Hall is like a locker room, and you gotta get in there, and you gotta snap towels at people, and you gotta give them the business, and if you can't take it, you know, you Then you can't take it.",You gotta leave the locker room.,Let's get down to brass tacks.,I know you don't have a lot of time and I want to thank you for meeting me today.,I just work right there.,"Well, thank you for clearing your schedule.",I didn't clear anything.,"You know this lot that I'm talking about, right?","Yeah, Lot 48.",Condo developer.,"He dug a basement, and then he went bankrupt.",I checked it out like a month ago.,It's pretty gross.,What would you say if I told you that I was thinking about turning it into a park?,"A park, huh?",Okay.,"Well, when I think about the logistics, the various hoops that you're gonna have to jump through, I would say, is it likely?","No, it's not likely, you know.","But, is it possible?",No.,It's not possible.,I would give up on that one.,What?,Why?,Why?,I don't know.,There's like a million reasons why.,"Homeowners' associations, antigovernment nuts, bureaucrats, miles of red tape Really?",It sounds like you're telling me to go for it.,There's no way it can happen.,I can do this.,I just need a little help.,"Could you do me a favor, for old times' sake?",Mark and I It's complicated.,"When you work closely with someone and you share similar interests and you have a similar world view and you're passionate about the same things, things can happen.",We slept together.,Leslie?,No.,"Oh, my God.",You know what?,"Yeah, we did, like, five years ago.","I sort of No, but yeah.","Yeah, we did.","Honey, can you straighten up your area a little bit?",'Cause they're gonna be here soon.,Can Thanks.,"That parks lady is coming over, and we're gonna go take a look at the pit.",I think it's probably just a photo op for her.,"I mean, I don't think anybody in government actually cares about Honey, do you mind doing that somewhere else?",I'm trying to watch TV.,I'm talking about the pit you fell in.,It's Ms.,Perkins' house.,Doorbell!,"Yeah, I heard it.",Doorbell!,I heard it.,I'm getting it.,I'm here.,Hey!,Wow!,Look at that.,Safety.,You remember Tom from last night.,"Hey, Ann, how are you?","Yeah, hey.",Of course I do.,"And this is our college intern, April.",She's going to be documenting our factfinding mission.,"Hey, April.",Hey.,Is this fun for you?,"Yeah, it's so much fun.",I'm just gonna grab my phone quickly.,Sorry.,This must be our hero.,The man heard 'round the world.,Uhhuh.,"How you doing, son?",Pretty good.,I'm Leslie Knope.,And the entire government of Pawnee would like to let you know that we will do everything we can to help you.,Could you pass me my itch stick?,Of course.,"So, Andy jumped over this fence.","He was crossing through to get home, and then he fell right there.","Oh, my God.",How did we let this happen?,"Dream with me for a second, Ann.",Doesn't this neighborhood deserve a firstclass park?,"Imagine a shiny new playground with a jungle gym and swings, pool, tennis courts, volleyball courts, racquetball courts, basketball court, regulation football field.",We could put an amphitheatre over there with Shakespeare in the Park.,It's really not that big of a pit.,We could do some of those things.,It's gonna take a little extra work.,But why not try?,I think that would be great.,"Me, too.",I'm going in.,Why?,Don't worry.,I have a hard hat on.,"I can see that, but Yeah.","April, document this.",Document what?,"The key to any factfinding mission is to get right into the battle zone, you know?",It's like George Bush when he flew over New Orleans or Richard Nixon when he went to China to see what the Chinese were up to.,No!,"Leslie, are you okay?",Leslie!,"Hold on, April's gonna get some photos for the website.",Could you just be still?,Don't move around as much.,"Okay, squeeze my fingers.",Good.,Does it hurt a lot?,No.,Mmmmmm.,I'm fine.,"No, you're not.",Good thing I was wearing that hard hat.,But it It fell off.,After my head hit that rod.,Wow.,"I can't believe you fell in, too.",That's awesome.,"It's not awesome, Andy.","Well, at least my boss will listen to me now that I broke my clavicle.",It's not broken.,It is.,Do you have one of those neck foam collar brace things?,"Honestly, you're fine.","Honestly, my clavicle's broken.","Oh, hey, baby, if you're going to the kitchen, could you make me pancakes real quick?",Sure.,Ooh!,Are pancakes being made?,Thank you.,Sure.,"I don't know, she's a little doofy, but she's sweet.","LESLIE Ron, please.",No.,No way.,"Come on, Ron.",I've been a loyal foot soldier.,Give me my shot.,Let me have Lot 48.,Is that a travel pillow around your neck?,"Ron, I don't know how to explain this to you.",When you've been down in the pit Have you been in the pit?,"No, I haven't gotten down there yet.","Well, I have.",When you fell in.,When I visited the bottom of the pit on a factfinding mission.,"And when you're down there, you get some perspective about what it all means.","And let me tell you something, Ron.",What it means is I want this subcommittee.,I've been quite open about this around the office.,I don't want this Parks Department to build any parks because I don't believe in government.,I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.,My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations.,Like Chuck E.,Cheese.,They have an impeccable business model.,I would rather work for Chuck E.,Cheese.,"Well, I will definitely think about it.",I like the sound of that definitely.,I'm gonna leave before you change your mind.,Mr.,"Swanson, I presume.",Lot Park?,Giving the park to me?,Still mulling.,RON She's insatiable.,She's like a little dog with a chew toy.,"All right, you guys.","All right, all right.",I'll ask him.,Everybody wants to know what your decision is.,Someone on the phone about the park.,"You know, I don't think I even want it.",Oh.,"Man, my clavicle's still really hurting me.",Oh!,This is a great shot.,I know.,That's awesome.,I think she's crying in that one.,Look at this one.,"Hey, kids.",That's another good one.,Hey.,"Hey, Brendanawicz.",You gotta come check this out.,"Leslie took us out to that pit in Lot 48, and she fell inside.",And we have some awesome photos., One.," Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine.", Oh! This is a classic., That's the best one., The up-skirt photo., Awesome.," Hey, man.", Give me the photo back., What's going on? Don't worry., I can print more., Leslie is unique., Government work can beat you down., I would say that I lost my optimism about government in about two months., Leslie's kept hers for six years.," I've got a few rules about how to survive and prosper in a government job, and I think I'm about to break one of those rules.", I want you to give Lot 48 to Leslie so she can try to build a park.," Why should I? You owe me one, remember? Do you want to cash in for this? Yeah, I do."," LESLIE So this was built in And a little trivia, it is one of the first structures in America to ever have locks."," Wow! Oh, yeah.", This is our crown jewel., It's one of our best murals., It depicts the very famous battle at Conega Creek.," We have a lot of children visit, so often we have to cover up the more gruesome parts with a poster.", That is horrifying.," Yes, it is."," So, what do you want to see? The DMV? Animal control? Or we could Leslie! We did it.", Ron's approved our committee.," Oh, my God.", That's great! That's so great., That's so exciting! This is huge.," I'm barely 34, and I've already landed a Parks Department exploratory subcommittee.", I'm a rocket ship., Leslie., I just heard the news., Hey., Isn't it great? Congratulations., Thank you., I'm so excited.," It's exciting, isn't it? It is.", Yeah.," Should I call a press conference now, or Yeah, call one.", Definitely., I would.," Every now and then we have these little gatherings, and Leslie gets plastered.", One time I convinced her to try to fax someone a Fruit Roll-Up., She one time made out with the water-delivery guy in her office.," On Halloween, she was dressed up as Batman.", Not Batgirl., Batman., And I convinced her to go stop a crime that was going on outside., And it is my favorite thing in the world., You know what? America is awesome., It's so full of hope and small towns and big cities and real people and delicious beverages and hot guys., You just never know when opportunity is gonna strike., Yeah., You gotta be ready for it., Yeah., Are you excited? Definitely am., Fired up., Yeah! I'm really fired up.," I You know they say that democracy or whatever only works when people get involved? Well, I'm getting involved.", So I am gonna make a vow now that I will do whatever it takes to get this pit filled in., Even if it takes two months.," Soul sista, soul sista Gonna get your phone, sista Yeah.", Sweet Lady Marmalard I've created this office as a symbol of how I feel about government., This sawed-off shotgun belonged to a local bootlegger., People who come in here to ask me for things have to stare right down the barrel., Did you guys get a grant to do this? This is my basketball court., I don't want to see any double dribble., I don't want to see any three-second violations., Bobby Knight!   ,"
                ",Season: 1 Episode: 02,"LESLIE Well, one of the funner things that we do here in Pawnee is the annual Easter egg hunt.","Tom hides the eggs, and I have to say he did an exceptional job this year.",I've been searching for 25 minutes and I haven't found a single egg.,And I'm an adult.,Oh.,"Yeah, I forgot to do that.",LESLIE Maybe Tom's trying to make this year a challenge.,"And if so, he's succeeding.",I don't think a single egg has been found yet.,Let's keep looking.,We're gonna find one.,LESLIE I'm going to see my mom.,She's a big muckymuck in the county school system.,She's my hero.,How do I explain her?,She's as respected as Mother Teresa.,"She's as powerful as Stalin, and she's as beautiful as Margaret Thatcher.","In or out, Leslie.",Doorway is creepy.,"Right, sorry.",Choosing in.,"So, what do you want, Leslie?","Just here to gossip, gab, chat, stuff we do.","But it looks like you're super busy, and I am super busy, so I shall bid you adieu.",Oh.,That's weird.,I just remembered something.,I have my own subcommittee now.,Yeah.,I'm sure you've heard something about it.,People are talking about it.,No.,Oh.,Well.,"Anyway, we're having a town hall meeting tomorrow at 7:00 p.",m.,At the Smithfield Community Center.,Mmm.,"Yeah, I'm leading it.",It's no biggie.,"I mean, it is.",It's a big deal.,"I mean, I don't know.",You know You want to come?,Oh.,"Honey, jeez.",You know how busy I am.,I know.,I know.,I know!,That's why I fake invited you.,I'll try to be there.,Okay.,"So, everybody's here.",Let's get started.,Ow!,Sorry.,"Oh, I'm sorry.",Metal.,Sorry.,That's really loud.,Subcommittee members.,Are we prepared for tomorrow night?,"Tom, have you booked the hall yet?","Yes, sir.","Ann, did you clear your schedule?",I did.,I changed my shift.,Okay.,"Leslie, I just have to say, I think you might be taking this to the public a little bit too soon.",It literally doesn't matter what you propose to the public.,"They might call for a vote, and if they vote you down, then you're done.",I don't care if there's gonna be a vote.,"I have a secret weapon, canvassing.",Nothing better than good oldfashioned doortodoor campaigning.,I'm not above using my expertise to change hearts and minds if the cause is just.,"When I was in sixth grade, I was voted Best Dressed by 87 votes.",And there were only Andy fell into that pit.,I fell into that pit.,How many more Pawnee citizens are gonna have to fall into that pit before we turn it into a park?,Zero.,Say it.,Zero.,Zero.,A hundred.,Zero.,I've got some sunscreen for your beaks.,"Tom, you probably won't need any.",Uh And this is our canvassing guide.,This is gonna be the script that we use when we speak with people.,"""If a person is a man, turn to page two.",""" ""If the person looks like a celebrity, example, Jack Nicholson, ""use this to help your pitch.","""Example, 'You can't handle the pit.","""'That's why we need to turn it into a park.","""' Oh.",This is really thorough.,Ann and I are a team.,You guys are a team.,"We have even sectors, you guys have odd sectors.",And we're gonna win.,Yeah.,Win what?,Go!,Okay.,"Ooh, someone's in there.",This is gonna be fun.,Are you excited?,"Excited, yeah.",Are you ready?,"Yes, definitely.",Are you pumped up?,Yes!,Look humble.,But confident.,Good afternoon.,We are representatives from your local government.,May we speak with you for a moment about the Sullivan Street pit?,Sure.,Excellent!,Positive response.,How would you feel if we turned that pit into a beautiful community park?,Oh.,Yeah.,That'd be a great idea.,Oh.,Good.,I actually live in the neighborhood So I could probably tell you a little bit about That's Go to section three.,Okay.,Um We are having a public forum tomorrow night.,"And it would be great if you could come, voice your strong support.",Tomorrow?,I can't.,I'm busy.,Sorry.,Oh.,"Yes, we understand that people are busy, but we would love for you to come to the meeting and to Sorry.","Good luck, though.",I'm all for a park.,Would it change your mind if we told you that She's gone.,"Yeah, a park, huh?",That sounds like a really good idea.,Great.,Would you be willing to come to a town meeting and show your support?,Absolutely.,"Now, is this park gonna have a playground or, you know, maybe a pool for the kids?","Oh, how old are your kids?",No kids.,Uhoh.,I'm gonna put him down as a yes.,Don't do that.,"Also, is the park gonna be at least 1,000 feet from my house?","Because, you know, I really can't move again.","April, please stand behind me.",That's it.,That's all.,That's all we've got.,No flier?,Nope.,Okay.,Thank you.,"Wow, man.",This is great.,This is so great.,I love canvassing.,What a great way to spend my time.,"All right, Team Haverford.","You guys are awesome, but I think I might work better as a solo artist.","So, I'm gonna head out.",Peace.,He runs weird.,He really does.,It's a good idea.,But I'm just not sure.,Okay.,Which part are you not sure about?,Turning the pit into a park.,That's kind of the whole thing.,"Well, look, I think this is a great idea, but I can't make any forum.",I would have to get a babysitter.,How old are your kids?,Four and two.,Could the 4yearold watch the 2yearold?,Okay.,Mickey!,"What's up, buddy?",How's my number one sod man doing?,"Look, here's the one, two, three of the situation.","One, we're building a new park, two, I'm on the committee, three, you're putting in the sod.","And who knows, you know?","Maybe, down the line, a situation will arise where you could hook me up.","Are you gonna commit to coming to this meeting tomorrow, or are you gonna be a bitch?","Yes, you do owe me.",Tom Haverford.,Okay.,"Keep going, keep moving.",Nose to the grindstone.,No means yes.,"Can we stop, please?","Because it's really hot, and I'm tired.","Yeah, I'm hot, too.",Let's blow on each other's faces.,Or we could drink some water.,"Yeah, let's do that.",My house is really close by.,Let's just go take a break for an hour or so.,"Okay, okay.","Look, I didn't want it to have to come to this, but, Ann, please open the sealed envelope that's in your binder.",This is a little something I learned from Karl Rove.,"If you want to guarantee the results of a survey, you design the question to give you the answer that you want.","""Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?",""" That seems iffy.","Yeah, don't worry about it, I made it all up.","Yeah, that's what I mean.","Wouldn't you agree, like most decent Americans, that it would be a good idea to turn the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street into a beautiful community park?",Oh.,"Actually, no.",I'm not really a fan of parks.,"Very noisy, barbecue smell all the time.",Would you change your mind if I told you that nine out of 10 meth users said the same exact thing?,What?,How would you even know that?,Survey.,We surveyed crystal meth users.,"We're actually having a little town meeting tomorrow night if you wanted to just Look, I know it sounds weird, but I just don't like living near parks.","So if you have a flier or something, I'd be happy to take it.",Thank you.,Okay.,You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park!,Excuse me?,"It's What I mean is, kids love parks and you should, too.","So, if I don't support your little project, then I don't love my daughter?","I didn't What time is this thing, anyway?","Oh, it's next month, forget about it.","Oh, it's tomorrow night.",I'll be there.,Great.,Okay.,Come on.,We got one.,Come on.,Am I talking to the two sexiest thighs in landscaping?,"Yes, I am, 'cause I'm talking to Marcy.",How's it going?,Tom Haverford.,"Kevin, your sandboxes are the best.",That's why I want you involved!,I just want the best monkey bars I can get in my park.,I don't mind hooking you up.,"Maybe, down the line, there'll be a situation where you can hook me up.","Thank you for your time, sir.","Hmm, he said some upsetting things.",I can't believe you gave him your home phone number.,"Well, I'm a public servant.",I need to be accessible.,What the hell is wrong with people?,I should show them Andy's medical bills.,Maybe they'd have a little sympathy.,"Oh, my God.",Ann!,Game changer.,You just busted the game wide open.,How?,Andy.,We need Andy.,He's our symbol.,We'll wheel him around the neighborhood to get sympathy.,He's a cute FDR.,Yeah!,Yeah!,"Ron, you got a minute?","Uh, sure, Paul.",What can I do for you?,The Sullivan Street Park project.,"You fasttracked it, right?","Yeah, absolutely.",We have a public forum tomorrow.,Okay.,Great.,I'll be there.,Great.,Mmm.,"""Hey!","You fasttracked that, right?",""" I'm sorry?",Did you say something?,Nope.,You didn't say anything to me?,Nope.,There's a new wind blowing in government and I don't like it.,"All of a sudden, there's all this federal money coming in, and Paul, the city manager, is telling us to build parks and start new community programs.",It's horrifying.,"Do you have, like, a nurse's costume?",Costume?,"You mean, like, scrubs?","Yeah, put those on.",Okay.,Please tell me Please tell me why My car is in the front yard Bass!,Come on.,And I'm sleeping with my clothes on I came in through the window last night It can be tricky dealing Don't LESLIE Why do I want to build this park so bad?,Maybe because a pit filled with garbage isn't the best that we can do in America.,"You know, in Russia, they could pretend that pit was a park, bring their kids down there.","""Hey, Vlad!",Look at these rocks!,"""Let's pretend they're potatoes!",""" ""Nikolai!",Do you want to swim in the dirt?,""" But not here.",Okay?,'Cause we're a nation of dreamers.,And it is my dream to build a park.,That I one day visit with my White House staff on my birthday.,"And they say, ""President Knope, this park is awesome.","""Now we understand why you are the first female President of the United States.",""" Leslie Knope, builder of parks.",How was canvassing?,"Canvassing was okay, but I think we're gonna have to postpone the town meeting.",Postpone?,Only for one to 90 days.,No.,You're doing this meeting.,You have my full support.,"I was talking to the city manager, exchanging ideas.","Um, there's a mutual respect there.","And together, we have decided to fasttrack your project.",City manager?,Wow.,Really?,I have to cancel this meeting.,Fasttrack?,Did my name come up at all?,"Oh, this meeting needs to be canceled.","No, it's happening.","Look, just do a good job tomorrow.",Okay?,We have to push this thing through.,Of course.,Of course.,I'll push anything through anything.,You know me.,Are you sweating through your suit?,I doubt it.,"It's a very breathable fabric Oh, yeah.",I am.,"Jerry, what's up, man?","Hey, you're into pretzels, right?",Bam!,"Hit them up, man.",Thanks for coming down.,I got a seat taped off for you over there.,"My top priority with this park, getting your fences in there.",I drove by one of your fences the other day.,"I was like, ""Man, that fence looks awesome.",""" I was like, of course, Roy's.","If you're into chocolate muffins, grab as many you want.",TOM Some people may say that bringing in these contractors this early is jumping the gun a little bit.,"Well, guess what?","Here's the gun, here's me.",Boom!,Victor Miles.,Tom Haverford.,How are you?,Thank you so much for coming down.,I want to introduce you to Leslie.,Victor Miles.,Hi.,He's a gentleman I met canvassing.,He also happens to be the top sod guy in Indiana.,That's terrific.,"Hey, Leslie.",Hey.,I really want you to nail this.,Don from Don's Cement.,Tom Haverford.,Good to see you.,I was thinking of a jingle for your company.,How's this?,Don's cement It's the best you can get Don's I'm so glad you're here.,Yeah.,"Andy came, too, to give his support.","I have a lot of stage experience, so This will be fine, right?",It's a park for God's sakes.,How much can they hate a park?,A lot of them seemed to hate a park yesterday.,April.,"April, I need you in the audience.",Okay.,"Wait, and if the questions start getting negative, I'm gonna call on you.",And I need you to sell the crap out of the park.,Can you do that?,Why?,"Please, April!",This is serious!,Can you do that?,Probably.,"Good girl, good girl, good ""probably.",""" Good girl.","Okay, here we go.","Line up, everybody.",My mom's here.,My mom's here.,My mom's here.,No.,I can't do that.,That's illegal.,Thank you so much for coming out tonight.,This is our first town meeting about the proposal to turn Lot 48 on Sullivan Street into a community park.,Yeah!,This is gonna be a train wreck.,"I want my daughter to be successful, which is why I always tell her, ""There's nothing wrong with being a wife and mother.",""" Now, there are many people that I spoke to who are passionately in support of this idea.","None of them were able to make it tonight, unfortunately.",But they totally exist.,I did not make them up.,"Oh, I see a question.",Okay.,"No, no.",No.,No questions right now.,My name is Kate Spivack.,Mmmhmm.,I remember you.,And I live in the neighborhood.,And I am 100% against this park.,"I cannot believe the department is moving forward with a project without a single environmental impact study, and if you guys agree with me, let's take a stand.",LESLIE Okay.,"We are a little ahead of schedule, because we're holding this town hall meeting so soon, which I was warned about by Mark Brendanawicz, our city planner assigned to this project.",Uh So what would he say?,Here we are.,"Leslie, should I give them some background info on the site?",Absolutely.,Okay.,Mark Brendanawicz knows the answer to every question.,He's amazing and congratulations for hearing him speak.,Hi there.,Leslie might have oversold me a little bit.,Certainly did not.,He's the man.,He's capable of anything.,Okay.,Lot 48 is It's a rectangular lot.,It's got excellent drainage.,And it's on the corner of Sullivan and Collins., Any questions? I have more of a comment than a question., Go for it., It's for the guy in the casts.," Here we go, Lawrence.", Yes., Yes., Yes., That is Andy Dwyer., He is a local resident and he tragically fell in the pit.," Uh, yeah.", I don't care about any of that., He's the guy that plays music all night in his garage., It's driving me nuts., Lawrence lives with his grandma., Which is pretty awesome.," He takes care of her, I guess."," But whatever, he's a douchebag."," It's loud, it's abusive, and it's waking up my birds."," You have birds, now? Yeah, I have birds."," I have nice, pretty, expensive birds, and you play that music, and it wakes them up."," Look, I don't work for the government, okay? Uh, I do play rock and roll.", Guilty as charged., I'm in a band., It's called Just the Tip.," And actually, if anyone here plays bass, we need a bassist.", Yes.," Okay, let's take a five-minute break, shall we? Uh.", It is not going well at all., Mmm-hmm., It's going very poorly., Okay? Mmm-hmm.," Like, you're crashing and burning.", Democracy's happening., People are talking.," I mean, at least they aren't apathetic, right? You're right about that.", They're deeply negative.," You need to put a happy face on this, give me a few positive talking points, and whatever you do, avoid a vote.", I'm oddly attracted to Kate Spivack.," Before we continue, I'd love to just give you a little history of Pawnee."," The City of Pawnee was incorporated in 1817, when a young man by the name of Reverend Luther Howell came from Terre Haute on an ox."," He planted his flag in the ground and was met soon after by an angry tribe of Wamapoke Indians, who, when seeing the whiteness of his skin, twisted him to death.", Flash forward to 1969., Man walks on the moon.," Pawnee is lousy with hippies My, God.", She's filibustering her own meeting., Filibuster! Boom! They can't touch you if you talk forever.," I can't speak of the future, but I will."," The future of Pawnee will involve us flying around in space taxis, where we will communicate on watches, and blink our feelings to each other, rather than use words."," And now, I'd like to take a magical journey through a little something I like to call The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster."," Excuse me? Can't you read that children's book on your own time? I have the floor! ""There once was a boy named Milo, ""who didn't know what to do with himself, not just sometimes, but "" Okay, all right."," You know what? This is a public forum, which means that we all get to tell you what we think."," Well, you did already talk, ma'am.", And I would love to listen to someone else., Someone I don't know., Uh That girl over there with the long brown hair and the yellow top., Could you tell us how you feel about this park? Go ahead., Hi.," Uh, I'm a youth in the community and I think a new park is a great idea."," And I fully support it, as would the rest of the youth in the community.", Hey! I recognize her., That kid came to my door yesterday.," Oh, my God! Okay, they have planted people in this audience.", Unbelievable! You know what? We all agree that this park is a bad idea., We should just take a vote., Right? Yeah.," LESLIE Okay, we will take a vote."," Before we do that, I want everyone up, lined up behind that microphone, and I want to hear from all of you.", One by one., ANN That was brutal.," A couple of weeks ago, I was yelling at Leslie at a public forum."," God, I hope I wasn't as obnoxious as those people."," I wasn't, right? At 5 00 in the morning, every morning, beep, beep, beep! I don't want to hear that."," Now, how long is this project gonna take? That's what I want to know.", That's what's important to me., Because I need my sleep.," I put some Thank you, ma'am."," Thank you, ma'am.", That concludes our meeting., What about the vote? We're out of time., It's 9 00.," But we will have many public forums in the future, and we hope to see you all there.", Thank you so much for coming., LESLIE It was tough.," But, you know, that's Pawnee.", That's democracy., There are a lot of people here that want this park., You just gotta get past the negative people., But guess what? My subcommittee held its first town hall meeting tonight.," God, I loved it! I loved every minute of it."," Hey, park lady.", Yeah? You suck.," Hear that? He called me ""park lady."," "" You know, normally, I don't agree with Leslie about anything, but this book is awesome.",   ,"
                ",Season: 1 Episode: 03,"Okay, now, see, here's a good example of a plant that you can't eat.",See all the spikes?,"So, two things.","One, it's poisonous.","And two, it would hurt.",LESLIE The Parks Department has so many programs.,Jerry's in charge of our preteen nature hikes.,"For a while, it was a teenage nature hike, but then we changed it because a girl got pregnant.","Look what we have here, country honeysuckle, Pawneestyle.","Yeah, take a look at that.",Wow.,It's pretty and it smells good.,Mmm.,Smells great.,"Yeah, it's really nice.",Mmm.,That's bitter.,"Leslie, you don't eat it.",Oh!,Why did you let me eat that?,I never told you to eat that.,Oh!,God.,"Leslie, the animals know you don't eat the country honeysuckle.",I'm not an animal.,My tongue is swelling up.,"No, don't touch it!","No, you can't Okay, now you'll have to throw that away.",Let's not scare the kids.,Okay.,All right.,All right.,"Well, there we go then.",Let's see what else is here.,"So let's tell them what other plants we can eat, Jerry.","But I have to say, there's a very sweet aftertaste though.",LESLIE So I have a piece of good news.,I've invited a reporter to come do an article about the pit behind your house.,"She writes for the Pawnee Journal, which is kind of like our town's Washington Post.",That sounds really good.,"Thank you, Ann.",It is a classic strategy.,The press is a weapon and you can use it to kill people or to feed people.,"You know, the beginning of projects are very vulnerable, and you have to make sure that you get a lot of press, 'cause the momentum of that can kind of keep it alive, or else it'll die.","I mean, I'm sure you remember the Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project.",The Tucker Park Graffiti Removal Project was a great idea that just ran out of steam.,"We had removed five cartoon penises, not even 10%, when we were shut down due to lack of funding.","To this day, I am haunted by those remaining penises.",One penis in particular.,"Now, when the reporter gets here, it is vital that we all follow my rules about how to deal with the media.","Rule number one, stay on message.",This is key.,"All we need to talk about is the pit, and the fact that we're gonna turn it into a park.",And that's it.,Okay?,Number two What?,Stay on message again?,"Yes, it's that important.",It's one and two.,Stay on message and stay on message.,Right?,"Stay on what, Ann?",Message.,Great.,"ANN Leslie formed a committee to fill the pit in a week, which is really impressive.","I mean, until now, my only experience with government was trying to get a recycling bin.",Wait.,Did I ever get it?,"Bye, Leslie.","Bye, Ann.","Hey, Mark?",Yeah.,Buy you a cup of coffee?,"This is JJ's Diner, the unofficial meeting place of Pawnee's political elite.",The people who eat here basically run this town.,"So, listen, I was hoping maybe I could pick your brain about how to deal with the media.",It's my first interview.,What about that thing you did for the middle school newspaper last year?,Oh.,No.,I don't count that.,That was a smear job.,So I put together some discussion topics.,Can I run them by you?,Okay.,What do you think her opening gambit is gonna be?,What is she gonna ask me first?,How you spell your name.,Of course.,"Because of the silent ""K.",""" You're so smart.",Yeah.,"Okay, now should I give her a tour of the building How many discussion questions do you have there?",Um Thirty.,Wow!,You're insane.,Mark and I made love once.,And it was very intense.,"Hi, I'm looking for Leslie Knope.",Okay.,Oh!,My ears are ringing.,Hi.,Hi.,I'm Leslie Knope.,Hi.,I'm the deputy director of Parks and Recreation.,Shauna.,MalwaeTweep.,"Yes, I am familiar with your work.",I've read everything you've ever written.,You did an amazing indepth article on the raccoon problem here in Pawnee.,Who left the door open?,No!,No!,No!,And I agree with you.,They are nature's bandits.,Thanks.,I was happy with that line.,"So, can I give you a quick tour before we get started?",I've been here before.,A few times.,Quick tour?,Okay.,So there are 10 murals here in this hallway.,"And this is called ""The trial of Chief Wamapo.",""" It was painted in 1936 and this is Chief Wamapo and he was convicted of crimes against the soldiers.",I am always amazed at his quiet dignity right before he's killed by a cannonball.,I'm surprised no one's complained about this.,"Oh, tons of people have.","Yeah, we get letters every day.","This is Ron Swanson, our boss.","Ron, this is the reporter I was telling you about.",No comment.,About what?,"Hey, Haverford, maybe one day you'll figure out how to spell a threeletter word.","Come on, Ron.","I play a lot of online Scrabble with my boss, Ron Swanson, and, oh, my God, that guy is the best.",He beats me every time.,He kills me.,He's awesome.,I can't beat him.,I should just close my account.,"Well, Shauna, this is our crack team.","Hi, everyone.","Tom Haverford, boy genius.",Smooth like milk chocolate.,That's a weird way to describe me.,"April Ludgate, 19.",Cool enough to be invited anywhere and chooses to be here.,"And finally, we've got Ann Perkins and Andy Dwyer.",They're the real heroes of this story.,Ann was the citizen who brought the pit to our attention.,And Andy is the citizen who fell in it.,Great.,"It's cool if I record this, right?",Yeah.,Good.,That way it's verbatim.,"So, Leslie, you're in charge of the committee.",I'm sorry.,"It's actually called a subcommittee, not a committee, so.",We can do all this on tape.,Right.,Sorry.,Sure we can.,"And this is where you meet, generally?",Really?,We meet at a bunch of different places.,We don't always meet here.,So I didn't quite know how to answer that.,"Okay, why don't I ask the rest of your team some questions and then we will come back to you later?","Okay, great.",That's a good idea.,Because these are the real heroes.,I'm gonna be in my office.,"So, Andy, tell me about the night you fell into the pit.",Oh.,Yeah.,That's actually a great story.,"I just finished up a gig with my band Three Skin, formerly Four Skin, but our bassist left for personal reasons.","And I was taking a shortcut home, and I thought I saw a toaster lying in the pit.","And I was like, ""Maybe I should get that.",""" And I fell in and broke my legs.",Such a tragedy.,Why would you want a toaster that's lying at the bottom of the pit?,I don't know.,I was pretty wasted.,Wait.,You were drunk?,"Oh, yeah.",Totally.,You knew that.,"I didn't know that, no.","You should've told me, because we gave you anesthesia at the hospital.",I was probably not thinking 'cause I had two broken femurs and I was blackout drunk.,"Andy, I just I can't believe I'm just finding this out right now.",Like you're perfect.,You're on the pill.,You drink all the time.,You're allowed to do that.,Stay on message.,Thank you so much for bringing that up in front of a reporter.,"Leslie, it's not that bad, right?","I mean, why don't we just go back in there and talk about the park?","Oh, Ann.",You're so sweet and innocent and pretty.,"The press are like sharks, and you guys just dumped a bucket of chum in the water.","Hey, I just got your 15 texts.",Mark.,"Listen, thank you for coming.",I tried to stay on message.,Mmmhmm.,"But then, Ann and Andy sandbagged me.",Andy was drunk when he fell in the pit.,And it turns out that Ann is on birthcontrol pills.,Okay.,"Shauna is in the conference room, and she's writing a really bad article and it's gonna destroy us all.",Please fix it.,"April, let me ask you something.",Do you think I'm in the top five bestlooking Indian guys in Pawnee?,No.,Who do you think's got me beat?,That guy Hashish at City Planning?,Tommy boy.,"Let me tell you something, Tom.",You suck at Scrabble.,I know.,You're destroying me.,"You're worse than my exwife, and she's terrible at Scrabble.",And she's a bitch.,"Look out, man.",I'm gonna get you one of these days.,I'm practicing.,"Yeah, I doubt that.",Her name is Tammy Swanson and she's a serious bitch.,"Hey, Leslie.",I have to go.,Let's do the interview tomorrow morning at the pit.,Yeah.,Perfect.,Great.,I'll have a photographer meet us there.,Okay.,Great.,See you then.,Disaster averted.,"That was easy, right?",Yeah?,Can we go in your car?,Absolutely.,All right.,'Cause I hate driving.,There's a beautiful view from over there.,This is a great place to take a shot.,"Over there as well, so I think you're fine.",Hi!,Hi.,Sorry I'm late.,"Oh, no problem.",Do you live near Mark?,"No, not at all.",So he gave you a ride somehow?,Yeah.,"You know, do you have a pen?","'Cause I don't No, sorry.","Michael, do you have any paper I could borrow?","I might, yeah.","I don't mean to complain, but I think Shauna is being a little unprofessional.",She got here She's wearing the same dress she wore yesterday.,And she had to get a ride from So how big is this lot?,"Leslie, how big is What?",How big is the lot?,The lot?,How big is what?,I don't know.,You tell me.,How big is the lot?,A hundred or something.,Give or take 100.,I don't know.,A hundred what?,"I don't know, Shauna MalwaeTweep.",I don't know.,I don't I guess I don't know anything.,Are you okay?,I have to get something from my car.,What are you doing?,Kicking Ron's butt at Scrabble.,"I just played ""lexicons"" for a billion points.","No, no, no, no, no.",What?,"I was letting him win, dumbass.",Whatever.,Oh.,Come on.,"""Lateral, communal, zonal""?","You dropped a ""Z"" in there?",April.,So when did you start at the Parks Department?,"Well, it was a few years ago.",My mother got me the job.,I was qualified.,It's not like it was nepotism.,Crap on a stick.,"Okay, technically, yes, it was nepotism.","But Oh, my God.","No, it wasn't.",Sorry.,It's not you.,I just I'm exhausted.,"I got, like, zero sleep last night.",So Oh.,"Hey, Leslie.",Hey!,You're home.,"Yeah, I'm home.","I was doing an interview at the pit, and it was going really well.","In fact, it was going perfect.","But I decided to leave in the middle of it 'cause I figured I nailed it so why push it, right?",Yeah.,Can I come in?,"Sure, yeah.",Great.,Come on in.,So how'd it go?,"She didn't ask about Andy being drunk, did she?",Oh.,No.,"No, just your kind of standard questions.",There was one annoying thing.,She and Mark had sex with each other.,You're kidding.,"I wish I was, but I'm not.",They did it.,Shauna MalwaeTweep and Mark Brendanawicz had sex with each other last night.,Who had sex?,That guy Mark and the reporter.,Called it.,I called that.,You remember that?,Yeah.,"He did, actually.",He totally called that.,Why do men have to behave like this?,Why can't they be professionals?,Men are dogs.,"You know, maybe they really like each other.",He doesn't like her.,He was probably thinking with the head of his wiener instead of the head of his brain.,Oh.,God.,"Andy, come on.",Men do that.,It's disgusting.,"Well, I should go talk to him.",Make sure that he didn't say anything to hurt the project.,Yeah.,"Definitely, you should talk to him.",Yeah.,"Good idea, Ann.",I bet he didn't use a condom.,"Andy, God!","LESLIE Hello, Mark.",May I come into your office?,I need to speak with you about something very sensitive.,Something's come to my attention that requires your attention.,It has come to my attention that you had sex with Ms.,MalwaeTweep.,That's personal.,It's unethical and it's irresponsible for a public servant to have sex with a member of the press corps.,Especially when you have sex with someone who is so skanky.,"I mean, have sex with her and I'm gonna say something.",I don't want you to take it the wrong way.,But you're being a huge dork.,"Well, I can't allow that kind of behavior from someone serving on my subcommittee.","Well, then I resign from your subcommittee.",Shauna MalwaeTweep.,"Hi, this is deputy director of Parks and Recreation Leslie?",Hi.,"Yes, hi.",I accidentally ate an old burrito.,What?,I was acting strange at the pit and the reason is because I had food poisoning from an old burrito.,"So, I was hoping we could have a doover interview.",Maybe over lunch.,I'm buying.,"Yeah, I guess I'm free.",I'm assuming not Mexican.,Why?,Because of the burrito.,Oh!,"Yeah, well, it wasn't a Mexican burrito.",Are you sure that's the best thing for you right now?,"Oh, it's the best thing on the menu.","So, look, I feel like I may have gone a little off message at the pit.","Yeah, you seemed a little weird.","Well, I wouldn't say weird.","It's just, we're trying to turn a dangerous eyesore into a beautiful community park and a positive article could go a long way towards making that happen.",Great.,So what do you think the odds are that this park is actually gonna get made?,Can I say over 100%?,Because I would be lying if I said less.,Wow.,You seem a lot more confident than some of the other people I've spoken to.,Can I read you some of these quotes?,Be my guest.,"""The Sullivan Street pit is always going to be a pit.",""" Well, until it turns into a park.","Yes, I agree.","""Hey, you should write an article on unicorns, ""because they're more likely to exist than this park.",""" Oh, really?",Tell that to a 14yearold girl.,"""You should write an article on the Pope getting married, ""because that's more likely to

is just ""No.",""" ""This park is never, ever, ever, ever going to happen.",""" Might I ask who said that?",Mark Brendanawicz.,Yeah.,Hey.,Hi.,Can I talk to you for a second?,"Yeah, what's up?",You and I need to find a way to fix this reporter thing.,Why is this a big deal to anybody?,"Well, apparently, the reporter is gonna print everything you said to her.",But I didn't say anything to her.,"""The park is never, ever, ever, ever getting built?",""" But that stuff was off the record."," Did you say it was off the record? Do you have to say it's off the record? Oh, God.", Hey., Thank you so much for meeting us., Sure.," Hey, Mark.", Hey., Uh I heard that you were gonna print some of that stuff that I said in private about the park.," Oh, yeah.", My editor loves it.," You know, we'd really appreciate it if you didn't print that stuff 'cause we're trying to build this park I don't understand."," You did say it, right? Technically."," Technically? Well, you know, you got up because you had to write the article and I said, ""Come on, stay in bed."," ""That park is never, ever, ever gonna get made."," "" Right.", And then I came back to bed.," Yeah, but the important part of what I said was, ""Stay in bed."," "" You know, I would've said anything at that point if I thought it would make you stay in bed."," Okay, well, since we're, you know, romantically involved, I won't print any of it.", That's great., Thank you so much., You're welcome.," You know, I wouldn't say romantically involved."," You know, going forward."," Oh, my God.", What? Ron Swanson., Tom.," Ron, I don't know what to tell you, man.", April got on my computer., Password was saved., She played a couple of Scrabble words., It wasn't me., I don't even know what lexicons are., I thought that was a luxury automobile., You're the word king., She was probably cheating., I knew that couldn't have been you., You don't have the vocabulary., I know., You can't even spell vocabulary., Yeah., V-O-G-X Was that right? No., We're cool., I'm not an idiot., I know Tom has been losing to me on purpose., But I like Tom., He doesn't do a lot of work around here., He shows zero initiative., He's not a team player., He's never one to go that extra mile., Tom is exactly what I'm looking for in a government employee.," Hey, you busy? Well, I'm writing an op-ed piece about media ethics for the Pawnee Journal, so, yeah, I'm a little busy.", I wanted to apologize to you., Really? Yeah., I never should've done anything with that reporter., Whoa! You nailed Malwae-Tweep? Nice.," Yes, but I'm not gonna do it again.", It's over., So she's available., I really did think that that stuff that I said was off the record.," But you were right, and I should've listened to you.", I tried to get her to pull some of those quotes and things got a little dicey.," Well, I appreciate you trying.", Would you like to be reinstated onto our subcommittee? Absolutely., You'll have my answer within the month.," Mark, can I ask you a question? You didn't really believe it when you said that the park was never gonna get made, right? Park's gonna get done."," Welcome back, subcommittee member Mark Brendanawicz.", Thanks., Thank you., Thank you., Thank you.," Thanks, a lot.", Thank you a lot.," Man, that dude has stuck it in some crazy chicks."," LESLIE Well, the article came out, and it was a mixed bag."," ""An abandoned lot on Sullivan Street ""has been proposed as the site of a new park."," "" That part's good.", I think we stayed on message for that part., And then it gets a little unpleasant.," ""Pretty drunk, Ann's on the pill."," "" I didn't ""throw up,"" I spit up.", JJ's Diner gets a nice mention.," Oh, and right here.", At the end.," She writes, and I quote, ""We'll see."," "" Ends on a hopeful note.",   ,"

of Parks and Recreation.,Nice!,"Okay, all right.",Cool it!,Okay.,Get her shoes!,No!,That's disgusting!,What are you doing?,Help!,Help!,Help!,Tom!,Tom!,No!,Smells so bad!,Why would you think this was fun?,Really?,"Oh, really?",Really?,"Oh, hey!",Hey!,You like it?,Boom!,"Okay, here we go.",Who wants it?,"Whoo, missed it!",Yeah!,"Actually, this is a little fun.",This is fun.,Get her hair!,Oh.,Ooh.,"Hey, Tom.",Check it out.,Norton Construction just sent this over.,"Whoa, mama!",I love Great Lakes wine.,You can have the wine.,I want to take that cheese and do terrible things to it.,"No, no, no, no, no!","You know as well as I do that we are not allowed to accept gifts over $25, for corruption reasons.",We live in a fish bowl and the public is always watching.,That's why I go two towns over if I want to rent a movie with nudity in it.,Mmm.,"Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said that.","But you cannot enjoy this basket, I'm so sorry.","And so to avoid temptation, I am gonna lock it up.","When you're in government, there's a million ways to exploit your power.",Have I ever given in to that temptation?,"No, never.",I'm not that kind of politician.,Official Parks and Rec business.,Just need to grab a quick hot dog.,"Sorry about that, little girl, you can have the next one.","TOM I have a moral code, and I never violate it.","People look at me and they say, ""Wow, Tom.","""You are so pure, you're like a brown Superman with a beard ""that just stands for justice and truth and the American way.",""" So, Ann.",I asked April to create one of those social network Internet profiles for the Sullivan Street pit.,"So, are you guys ready for the debut?","Yes, can we cut that red ribbon around your monitor now?",Absolutely.,I love a good ribbon cutting.,Oh.,"April, that's good.",Yeah.,Kids.,"Hey, look, the pit already has six friends.","Oh, yeah.",Mark.,Mark's a friend.,"Well, you guys gotta see Mark's profile.",Look at the photos of these ladies on his page.,Wow.,Ew!,Sick.,Maybe those are his relatives.,"Yeah, maybe fake boobs run in his family.",Look at this lady.,She's got a thong on her face.,"Oh, my God, his favorite movie is Dances With Wolves.","Okay, we're good.",We'll keep checking in on this.,"Where is Mark, anyway?",Attending yet another meeting of the old boys' club.,"LESLIE Politics is full of boys' clubs, formal and informal.",Behind me are all the members of the city council over the past 30 years.,"And every day, as a woman, I have to walk past this wall of men.",It can be very upsetting.,Especially because of that guy.,"No matter what direction I move, he's always staring at my chest.",Hmm.,See?,What are they doing out there?,Wheeling and dealing.,Divvying up the empire.,"Oh, my wife got me this shirt.",She swears it makes me look thinner.,It kind of does.,You know what we should do?,Let's go out there.,Let's bust up that old boys' club.,We're doing great work in the government.,We deserve to be included.,"Sure, yeah.",I could use a beer.,"Yes, Ann!","That's good, think like a man.","April, we're leaving, you're in charge.",And it's because you're a woman!,"What, do you really like red tape and uphill battles?","Hey, Leslie!",Hey!,What is up?,I'll tell you what's up.,A couple of ladies are coming to bust up your little boys' club.,Awesome.,Glad to have you.,Let me get you a beer.,We're in.,"Hey, I'm Brian.","Hi, Brian, Leslie Knope.",Deputy director of Drink that.,Okay.,"I'm Ann, everyone.",I don't work here.,"Hey, Ann.",Steve.,"So, what are you guys talking about?",What's the topic du jour?,Oh!,Did you hear that?,That was the sound of a glass ceiling being shattered.,"LESLIE The boys' club is more about socializing than work, you know?","I mean, you gotta loosen up.",I kind of feel like I'm already in the boys' club.,"I mean, look at those bitches clean up after me.","So, is this, like, your regular Tuesday night scene?","Well, it's just a way to unwind, you know.",Mmmhmm.,"Really different from your Friday night crowd, right?",What crowd?,"You know, the girls with the tribal back tattoos who drink Red Bull for a living.",Oh!,"Oh, I like this.",This is banter.,That crowd.,Banter's fun.,Where'd that come from?,"We were just on the computer, looking at your profile.","You know, you have a friend who has a tattoo that says, ""Daddy's Girl.",""" And both words are misspelled.",Ooh!,Mixing it up with the boys!,So What are you gonna say?,What's your comeback?,Those aren't really my friends anymore.,I don't hang out with them.,"Oh, boo.","Brendanawicz, that's some weak sauce.",You need to hit harder!,"Natalie, it's your sister.",Pick me up or I'm gonna draw all over your jeans.,"Well, it's official, people.",We're out of beer.,That's the cue.,"See you later, Leslie.","It was nice hanging out, you know, after work hours.",Wait!,"I think I'm gonna take off, too.","Yeah, I should go, Leslie.","Wait, you guys!",Let's keep this good feeling going.,It's just getting started!,"Uh, yeah, 'cause parties usually get started when you run out of booze.","Okay, wait.",Just hold on a second.,I got wine!,Hey!,And cheese!,Hey!,Good morning.,"Last night, in a foolish attempt to infiltrate a boys' club, I violated the government employee ethics code of the state of Indiana.","I have always tried to live my life in an ethical way, and last night, I failed.","I realize I have let down every female public official in America, and I would like to apologize to them, right now, individually, and in alphabetical order.","Michele Bachmann, Republican, Minnesota.",I am sorry.,"Tammy Baldwin, Democrat, Wisconsin.","I'm so sorry, Tammy.",Melissa Bean.,Okay.,"Double shift, remember?",So I won't see you till tomorrow.,Are you gonna be okay?,"Oh, yeah.",I got dinner.,"Oh, God.","Honey, can you just clean up a little bit?",I'll try.,Don't expect much.,Okay.,I'll do it when I get home.,You will?,Yes.,Yes.,AND Y Ann is amazing.,"She takes care of me, she takes care of sick people, sick babies.",She is an angel.,And I seriously love her.,Hard.,She's going to be gone for the next 24 hours so I made this list and basically this place is gonna be like a sparkling palace when she returns.,I took a bunch of painkillers.,They're about to kick in so I'm ready to go.,There it is.,Let's clear the air.,"Last night, I opened up this gift basket, for my own pleasure.",Really.,Leslie Knope.,Usually such a prudish stickler for the rules.,"I'm not happy about it either, Tom.",It's like I don't even know you anymore.,Last year you wrote me up for making personal phone calls to my mom.,"Yes, I did.",And I would do it again.,Two wrongs do not make a right.,"Yes, but she was in the hospital.",I did not know that at the time.,"So, can I have the basket?","No, I'm sorry.",It's evidence.,It's a nice basket.,What would you put in there?,I don't know.,Potpourri?,That's a lot of potpourri.,"Hey, I am not the one on trial here.",I appreciate and thank you in advance for your unwavering support.,I think you should go to jail.,Think about what you've done.,Go to jail?,What's going on?,"Ron, I have a very important and very long story to tell you.",Put it in an email?,Nope.,"It happened right out there, right outside this window.",Why can't I look away?,Let's not blow this out of proportion.,I will blow this in proportion!,The minimum punishment for this is an official reprimand from the city manager.,It's not that big a deal.,Maybe in your world it isn't a big deal.,"You're a white Protestant man with a full, rich mustache.",But I am a woman and I need to hold myself up to a higher standard.,This is ridiculous.,You're punishing yourself more than anybody else is gonna punish you.,No.,What do you suggest we do?,You think we should cover this up?,"No, I'm not saying that.",No one said coverup.,"Good, because the coverup is worse than the crime.","When you spill something and you try to wipe it up with something that's dirty, then you get double dirty.",Please don't make this worse.,"Oh, my God.",Good afternoon.,"Since we last spoke, I have taken extraordinary steps to make further amends for the mistakes that I have made.","LESLIE I have written a full confession, which I will be emailing to everyone in the entire Pawnee government.","I've also attached a link to the pit's web page, just to remind people of all the good work that I do.","I asked Ron to blow the whistle on me, and he refused.",And that is why I had to whistleblow myself.,"AND Y I wish I could say some of this mess was Ann's, but it's all mine.",I'm kind of a nester.,Huh?,Not bad for a guy with two broken legs.,Hey.,Hey.,I'm doing a little experiment tonight to see what will get me drunker.,Drinking wine Leslie.,Come here.,See what April put on the pit's web page.,"Right now, drinking wine is winning Oh, my God.",What am I looking at?,A video of me drinking some of that wine you stole.,What?,Why did you do this?,"Because I was waiting for my sister and I was bored, and my hair looked really good.",And you put it in the pit's web page?,Yeah.,"Okay, take this off.",Okay.,"I just sent an email to everyone in the government, and I put a link to this page!",A young lawbreaker.,A future Leslie Knope.,"Play it again for us, Jerry.",You got it.,Leslie?,She's 19 years old.,I thought I told you not to make this worse.,And I heard you loud and clear.,But then you made it worse.,"The disciplinary committee is having a hearing tomorrow, and you're gonna have to testify.","Oh, no.",April might get dismissed.,You could get fired.,"Oh, my God.","Oh, my God.","Oh, no.","Oh, God.",This bench is so uncomfortable.,Ow.,Help.,"Please, Ron.",Ron.,"Ron, tell me it's gonna be okay.",Tell me it's gonna be okay.,It's gonna Ron?,Where are you?,It's It'II Hang in.,Ron!,Okay.,You're okay.,Good evening.,"I've spoken to you a couple of times about something that happened, but I don't want to I don't want to talk about it anymore.","So, the disciplinary committee awaits.",Feeling good?,Feeling strong?,Not really.,No.,Do you want me to run some test questions with you?,Maybe give you an idea of what the disciplinary committee will be like?,"Yeah, that'd be great.","Yeah, thanks, Tom.",Okay.,"So, Miss Knope, you're accused of stealing wine.","How many drinks do you have per week, on average?",Zero.,Zero to six.,I'm gonna write down 10.,Yeah.,Do you ever cheat on your taxes?,"No, no, no.",Never.,Good.,You're doing great.,How many sexual partners have you had in the last year?,Are they gonna ask that?,"This is a depositionstyle hearing, Miss Knope.",Nothing is offlimits.,You have to answer.,"Now, how many sexual partners have you had in the last year?",Zero to six.,Zero.,Have you ever thought about Ron sexually?,What?,Including dreams.,"Have you ever had a sexual dream about our boss, Ron Swanson?",No!,Absolutely not.,No.,Yes.,No.,"Now, in this recurring dream that you have about Ron, is he like a regular Ron, or is he halfRon, halfanimal, like a centaur?",What?,No Is he wearing a football uniform?,Are you making love to him on a couch shaped like his mustache?,Is he covered in Powerade?,"No, okay.",Timeout.,Timeout.,"This committee doesn't take timeouts, Miss Knope.",Now answer the question!,I need something to drink.,How about some stolen wine?,No.,I meant water.,"Thank you for your time, Miss Knope.",You're fired.,"So, that's kind of your worstcase scenario, you know?","If you can handle that, I think you'll be fine.",Great.,"LESLIE Ron, thank you for being here with me today.",I'm your department head.,I have to be.,Nonetheless.,MAN Miss Knope?,LESLIE Yes.,MAN You're here because you allegedly accepted a gift of over $25 and contributed to the delinquency of a minor.,Can you tell us what happened?,"I'm gonna take a glass of water first, if I may.",Certainly.,Sorry.,"""Two days ago, ""I attended an informal boys' club meeting for the very first time.","""After one and a half beers, ""awash in the glow of acceptance ""into this elite, exclusive club "" Sorry, what club is this?",A couple city planners like to drink beer in the courtyard on Tuesday nights.,No one is supposed to drink alcohol on government property.,That's not my department.,"Go ahead, Leslie.","""I made a very unwise decision."," ""A decision that will live in infamy."," ""I opened a gift basket of wine and cheese."," ""Our intern, April Ludgate, ""drank some of that wine without my knowledge."," ""That was never part of the plan."," ""She had not been invited to the meeting of the boys' club."," ""I repeat, not been invited."," ""Though it is my hope that someday, she lives in a world ""where the very idea of boys' clubs is ancient history."," "" But you did open the gift basket.", And the intern did drink the wine., Please don't blame her for my mistake., The biggest crime we could commit here would be to destroy a teenage girl's passion for local government.," There's only one more thing I need to clean, me."," Um, I can't really get into a shower, so I got this idea from my parents.", This is how they clean their dog., Do you like that? Huh? I wrote that for Ann., It's gonna be playing when she walks through the door today., And check this out., Washed my shorts., How do you like that? Hey., Turn that down., No., I wrote that song., I don't care., Turn it down.," What are you doing in my yard, Lawrence? Get out of here."," Okay, you know what? I'm taking this.", Put down my boom box., It's my boom box now., I asked you nicely.," You did not ask me nicely! Put that down! I just put 12 new batteries in that thing! Lawrence, come on! What's going on out here? Give it to me! Come on."," Go back inside, Hank."," Miss Knope, what was the first thing you did when you arrived at work the next day? Can you go over the time line for us once more? Yes, of course.", I awoke at 6:21 a., m., After a fitful night of sleep We've been over this.," What more could you guys possibly want her to do? Well, we don't know yet.", Frankly we've got a lot more questions.," Ron, it's okay."," No, it's not.", This is not communist China., You cannot make her whip herself., You cannot make her wear a hair shirt., We weren't planning on doing either of those things., This is America.," You want to live in North Korea, you can live in North Korea.", I don't want to., I want to live in America.," Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying."," If you want to slap her on the wrist, go ahead."," If you want to do anything more serious, you're gonna have to go through me.", Let's go.," Are we done? We're done, let's go."," So, after all that, it's really not that bad.", You're gonna get a letter in your file.," Ron, I just wanted to say thank you, so Don't worry about it."," No, I didn't do it for Leslie.", I did it because I hate bureaucracy.," My idea of a perfect government is one guy, who sits in a small room at a desk, and the only thing he's allowed to decide is who to nuke."," The man is chosen based on some kind of IQ test, and maybe also a physical tournament, like a decathlon."," And women are brought to him, maybe, when he desires them."," LESLIE Oh, hey, Ann.", You're here.," ANN Yeah, I came from the hospital."," How'd it go? I don't want to be overdramatic, but today felt like and the absolute worst day of my life."," Oh, God.", I never should have opened that stupid basket., Yeah., Why did you open that basket? It doesn't really seem like you., I think it's 'cause I wanted to shatter the glass ceiling., You know what I mean? And just kind of infiltrate the boys' club., Hmm., I did it for a guy., Oh! Yeah., Mark., Oh., Oh., Wow., I We had a brief affair in February of 2004.," And there's still something very complicated between us, so Yeah.", Sure., Yeah., Smart woman., Iffy choice in men.," But then again, I'm not one to talk.", What do you think? Andy., This is so sweet., It's nothing.," What happened to you? Oh, I was chasing our neighbor who's a total jagweed and I fell in some prickly bushes.", Doesn't matter.," What do you think of the house, huh? Were you totally surprised? Yeah.", Do you love it? Yeah.," Here, baby.", Sit down., I'm gonna put something on those scratches., Somebody is getting gently laid tonight., Andy! God! You look like you need one of these., Come on., You're over 21., You're not supposed to be drinking on government property., Loosen up., You're gonna drive yourself crazy trying to follow every single rule in government.," Mark, I have a letter in my file.", I got seven letters in my file., Pretty much every guy in city planning has a bunch of letters.," So, welcome to the team."," Look out, boys.", I'm in your club now., I'm in your club., I'm in your club., I'm in your club., I'm in your club., I'm in your Mmm., Creepy.,   ,"
                ",Season: 1 Episode: 05,"In a town as old as Pawnee, there's a lot of history in every acre.","This wooded area is the site of, um, the murder, actually, of Nathaniel Bixby Mark.","He was a pioneer who was killed by a tribe of Wamapoke Indians, after he traded them a baby for what is now Indianapolis.",They cut his face off.,And they made it into a dream catcher.,And they made his legs into rain sticks.,"And that's the great thing about Indians, back then, is, they used every part of the pioneer.",Today is a great day for the Knope family.,My mother is being honored at a banquet with the Tellenson Award for Excellence in Pawnee Public Service.,"The award's named after the legendary Tony Tellenson, who was a great man.","Sorry, is a great man.","I, for one, am glad that they're keeping him alive.",I saw you survive that town hall meeting.,You keep that up and you're gonna be figuring out what wall to put your own Tellenson Award on.,"Oh, I already know, the one on the left where the American flag is.","But I think we could be a multigenerational political dynasty, you and I, you know?","Like the Kennedys, or the Bushes.",Minus the drinking problem.,I mean no disrespect.,The only reason anybody's going to this thing is because they're afraid of what Marlene'll do to them if they don't.,That woman is tough.,"In 1994, I gave her a nickname.","It's unrepeatable, but it stuck.",It's my proudest accomplishment.,"It's ""The Iron of Pawnee.",""" This is very exciting.",This is a big night.,"We are gonna meet some powerful people tonight, so take this down.",Mmmhmm.,Good evening.,Marlene GriggsKnope is my mother.,How important are speeches?,"I don't know, ask the Gettysburg Address.","Oh, it didn't answer your call?",Maybe because it was in the Smithsonian.,It was a great learning experience because my mom casts a long shadow.,Read that part back to me.,"""I was learningdisabled and my mom cast a very long shadow.",""" No, I didn't say ""learningdisabled.",""" Um, we'll just move on.",We can fix that later.,"Long shadow, go.","Okay, I've lost my momentum now.","Um, all right, let's start from the top.",What's the first sentence again?,"""Marlene GriggsKnope is morbidly obese.",""" I never said ""obese.",""" I said ""is my mother.",""" Oh, sorry.",I got it.,"I need to mention the park and in a very subtle way, I need to let people know that I'm forging my own path and I have my own subcommittee.",But I don't want to sound braggy.,What do I do?,"It's about appearing humble, you know?","Abraham Lincoln, when he started his speeches, he would come up and say, ""My name's Abraham Lincoln.","""I'm the President of the United States.","""But I'm gonna be honest with you.",I have no clue what I'm doing.,""" So, maybe you start off with something like that.",Okay.,"So, I start off with, ""I am Leslie Knope.","""I am the Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, ""and to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing.",""" Yeah.",Yeah.,"Then, I think what we want to do at that point is start getting the energy up.",Yeah.,How about this?,"""Marlene GriggsKnope is definitely not a whore.",""" No.","""Marlene GriggsKnope ""has not five but seven Asian friends.","""Marlene GriggsKnope has never solicited a male prostitute.","""Marlene GriggsKnope has said the Nword only four times in her entire life.",""" No!",No!,She said it more than that?,How about this one?,That is hot.,Seriously?,Yes.,That is really hot.,How come you don't dress up like that for me?,"Well, 'cause I would feel a little silly putting on a nice dress to go to ""the couch.",""" ANN I haven't been out in so long.",Andy being in a cast has definitely put a crimp in our social life.,"I don't really know Leslie's mom, and I don't know what the Tellenson Award is, but at this moment in my life, it sounds like a magical evening.","Babe, I'm out of milk.","ANN How dressy is this, exactly?",To the max.,It is the most exclusive local government event of the year.,Really?,Yeah.,The Tellensons is like the Oscars times the Grammys plus the Super Bowl.,Wow.,Okay.,"Um, I should probably change.",I'm headed to the salon right now.,LESLIE Salvatore Manfrelotti has been cutting hair across from Pioneer Hall since 1958.,All the movers and shakers who come through Pawnee have sat in that chair at one point or another.,"I mean, he's the guy that made Larry Bird look the way he does.",Next.,"So, what's the inside scoop, Salvatore?",My feet hurt.,Classic Salvatore!,Do I know you?,"Uh, no.",This is my first official political haircut.,"I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation.",Are you related to that Marlene SomethingKnope?,That depends.,Would you call being her daughter related?,What the hell else would you call it?,"Now, what do you want me to do with this?","Well, my mom is being honored tonight.","So, in a way, I am also being honored.","And I just wanted to mix things up a little bit, you know?","Pin it up, something sassy, but powerful and dynastic.","Hi, April.","Good evening, sir.","I'm off the clock, April.",You don't need to call me sir.,"Salvatore calls this hairdo ""The Mayor.",""" And yes, I will wear my hair like this when I am the first female mayor of Pawnee.","Oh, man, I am way overdressed.",What are you talking about?,You look great.,We look great.,Everyone's looking at us.,"Yeah, I know.",You want a drink?,"Yes, I do very much want a drink.",That man is staring.,That's former City Councilman Frank Schnable.,"Oh, we are in rarified air tonight, Ann.",Rarified air!,He's coming over.,What?,Okay.,"Be cool, be cool!",I will try.,Hello.,"Hello, former City Councilman.",I am Leslie Knope.,I am the daughter of the honoree this evening.,I just wanted to tell you that I think that what you two are doing is so brave.,Just being who you are.,I wish I had your courage.,"Okay, let's go.",RON I enjoy government functions like I enjoy getting kicked in the nuggets with a steeltoe boot.,But this hotel always serves baconwrapped shrimp.,That's my number one favorite food wrapped around my number three favorite food.,"I'd go to a banquet and honor of those Somali pirates, if they served baconwrapped shrimp.",Excuse me.,"Hey, Table 12.","Can I get a ""what what?",""" Wow.",Thank you.,"I mean, Ann, you look stunning, but, Leslie, wow.",I was going for wow.,You got it.,I was told it was black tie.,"I like your hairdo, Leslie.","Thank you, Ron.",It's just like my brother's.,He's an officer in the Air Force.,Baconwrapped shrimp.,Oh.,"Thanks, I'm okay.",I wasn't offering.,"Oh, Ann, don't look.","No, no, I said don't look.",Seated behind us is Janine Restrepo.,We need to rezone the pit to turn it into a park and she's on the zoning board.,"Oh, what a night!",Please.,This is so cool.,At that table are all eight living Tellenson Award winners.,"Bert Winfield, Geoffrey Morglesberg, Quentin Arble, Dawn Krink, Michael Holloway, I don't know who that is, that's somebody's wife, Horace Rangel, Wilmer Vism and Oscar Pfortmiller.",Wait.,Oscar Pfortmiller is dead.,"That's his disappointing son, Theo.",Another dynasty.,What a testament to my mother.,"If a bomb went off in here, it would definitely make the Indianapolis papers.","Guys, we have to get me to talk to Janine Restrepo.",She's right behind us and she could rezone our park.,"Well, then just go up there and say hello and start talking to her.","Brilliant political strategy, Mark.",Maybe I should mention her massive weight loss.,You're overthinking this.,"Here, I'm gonna pretend to be Janine Restrepo.","You, be you.",Go.,"Hello, Madame Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo.",I am Leslie Knope from the Parks What are you doing?,"Oh, I'm Pawnee Zoning Board Member Janine Restrepo.",And I can do whatever I want.,"Please, tell me about this park that you badly need rezoned by me.","Okay, well, I think it would be a good idea to have a multiuse community park.",Oh.,Do you?,Oh!,"Wait, what's that?",What?,I'm just former City Councilman Frank WhateverTheHell.,"And I have more power than Janine Restrepo, so I can do whatever I want.",I don't even know if that's true or not.,"Oh, my God, really?","Well, I'm Marlene GriggsKnope and I will destroy you all!",What the hell are you guys doing?,It's fun to pretend to be zoning board members.,Hey!,Hi!,Hey My goodness.,Look at you.,You like?,I went to Salvatore.,Salvatore usually does men.,Usually.,But this time he made an exception.,Hmm.,This is Ann Perkins.,"Oh, right, Leslie's new friend.","Yeah, friend.",She's We're friends.,Just friends.,I have a boyfriend.,He's a man.,"So, I need your advice.",I'm seated near Janine Restrepo.,The queen of the zoning board?,Am I the only Person here who doesn't know Janine Restrepo?,I think she could be very useful.,What's my in?,"Oh, let's see.",You wrote a speech?,Yes.,"It's 22 minutes long, with the song.",I could cut the song.,The song's cut.,Scrap the whole thing.,Let's make the speech work for us.,"Oh, politics!",Yes!,My mom is crazy good at this.,"Okay, the two things you have going for you is your connection with me, of course, and the fact that Restrepo loves feeling important.",So make sure that you butter her up.,I will.,I'll make her feel like a human dinner roll.,"Hello, everyone.","I'm Leslie Knope, Marlene's daughter.","Marlene GriggsKnope is my mom, but she's so much more than that.",She's also my mother.,"And together, we are the Knopes.","And if you weren't thinking it, you probably already said it, ""political dynasty.",""" Please save your applause until the end.",There are so many luminaries here tonight.,"I mean, the list includes such amazing people as zoning board member Janine Restrepo, and others.","In conclusion, my mom is Marlene GriggsKnope.",And I am just so psyched that Janine Restrepo is here.,"I love you, Mom.","And you, too, Janine.","You're the man, Leslie!","Thanks, Tom.","Hi, Ann.",I wish I could talk.,Moving and shaking.,This is my evening.,I'm Leslie's trophy wife.,I'd like to invite anyone who has a few words to say to Marlene to come up during dinner.,"Hello, Pawnee government!",My name is Tom Haverford.,"And if five years ago, you told me I was gonna be in this ballroom with Marlene GriggsKnope, I would've guessed we were getting married.",Janine?,Hi.,Hi.,Have we ever met?,"No, but I am a big fan.",I'm Marlene's daughter.,"Yeah, I got that.","Right, and I would love to speak to you about the ways we can improve our city.","Okay, well, call my secretary, and maybe we can set something up for next month.",Okay.,Okay.,Okay.,All right.,"Next month, then.",Fine.,Uhhuh.,Bye.,"Andy, I can't leave now.",I'll get one for you on the way home.,"Okay, meatball and ham.","Wait, is that two different subs?",Really?,I don't know if they can do that.,Come on!,I'm serious!,"Now, the words ""too sexy"" aren't really in my vocabulary, but, Marlene, girl, you are too sexy!","I refuse to lather Marlene up, kiss her ring like everybody else.",Instead I'll be delivering a speech of facts.,Marlene is a woman.,She has worked in the government for three decades.,Thirty years.,"Properly applied, that's how long a good varnish should last.","So, Marlene, it is true that you have won this award.",Brendanawicz.,Let's bounce.,We're gonna be late.,For what?,Ladies.,Scully's Bar.,Let's go.,"Bounce, bounce, bounce.",No.,"Please, you guys are the only people here I know.","Uh, well, this thing's kind of wrapping up.",Maybe we could leave a little later.,"Uh, it's 9:30, on a Friday night in Pawnee.","There's not gonna be a later, Mark.","Come on, now, you promised we'd go hit on chicks.",Maybe you and Leslie can join us at the bar.,"Look, I would love to come hit on chicks with you guys, but she seems kind of engaged in something and I think I should probably stay.",You'd hit on chicks?,For real?,"All right, you know what?",We're gonna be at Scully's if you two can tear yourselves away.,"Let's do this, Mark.",It went really well with Restrepo.,She said I should call her and we can set something up next month.,Did she say call her or call her secretary?,Secretary.,"That's good, right?",Secretary makes her schedule.,"That's great, honey.",She's blowing us off.,What?,No!,Really?,"Honey, she's totally blowing us off.",What?,That is not conduct worthy of the zoning board.,She's a little weasel.,"Okay, I didn't want to have to use this, but her husband got a DUl in Illinois last week.",And she's trying to keep it quiet.,"Well, everyone has their problems.","So, what should my next tactic be?","The DUl, Leslie.","Let her know you know all about it, connect it to what you want, and then tell her if she doesn't help you, and soon, you're gonna tell everybody in town.",I don't think I could do that.,"I mean, I want to win a Tellenson Award some day.",They don't give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.,"Sweetheart, they only give lifetime achievement awards to people who do things like that.","Those are eight of the nastiest, most diabolical people you could ever want to meet.",Bert Winfield was a blackmailer.,And Dawn Krink slept her way to the top of the DMV.,Trip Holloway named names in the '50s.,Horace Rangel used the police department to harass journalists.,"And Jesus, honey.",Tony Tellenson was the worst.,He tried to resegregate the drinking fountains.,"Hey, Ann, where's Mark?",He left with Tom.,Shoot!,"I have a tough assignment, and I need his help with it.",I could help.,Give me something to do.,"Okay, well, apparently Restrepo was trying to blow us off, so my mom has a plan.",We're gonna twist her arm a little bit.,She's trying to cover up for the fact that she has a husband who likes to vroomvroomvroomvroom and glugglugglugglugglug.,So you're gonna blackmail her?,"No, I'm just gonna get tough with her, Tellensonstyle.","That doesn't sound tough to me, that sounds slimy.",It sounds like your mom's telling you to be slimy.,"Ann, you don't understand politics.","Look, nursing is easy.",Really?,Yeah.,"You just go to work, and people come in, and you heal them.","But politics is different, you know?",Sometimes you have to bring the pain.,You can't let yourself get taken advantage of.,I think your mom's giving you bad advice.,I don't think so.,You just do everything your mom tells you to do?,You just do everything your boyfriend tells you to do?,Make any pancakes lately?,He has two broken legs.,"Yeah, and he's got three crutches.",And one of them is you!,And the other two are crutches.,"You know, I don't need to be here.",It's okay.,You're allowed to fight.,You two are just like everyone else.,"Thank you, former Councilman Schnable.","And now, a very special message from Mr.","Anthony Tellenson himself, recorded earlier this year from his hospital bed, before he lost the power of speech.","I'm leaving now, honey.","Cool Ranch, got it.",Anything else?,Mmm I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get those tonight.,"Well, 'cause I don't think I can find a store that's open that sells slippers.",TOM I've been dying to go out with Mark.,Always thought we'd make a great team.,You know?," He's handsome, I'm a cutie pie.", He's laid back.," I'm more in your face, but in a fun way.", Ladies don't stand a chance., Uh What's with the hat? It's called peacocking.," Basically, I'm wearing something that kind of makes me stand out, like a peacock."," So, the girls will be like, ""Hey, what's with that hat?"" I'm gonna go peacock it out.", I'll be back., Okay.," Thank you, Tony, for those inspiring twitches and blinks.", LESLIE I think we're gonna meet a little earlier than what you said., How about Monday? Call my secretary and we'll set it up., Not good enough., Not good enough? Nope., I know about things.," Well, my schedule is my schedule."," So, I'm just gonna get back to my dessert.", Drive much? Excuse me? Your husband., Does he drive much out of state? I know that your husband is a drunk driver., My mom told me., What do you want? Uh Just saying., I Get out.," Oh, my God.", I'm so sorry., Mmm-hmm., I don't know what came over me., Leave., I hope your husband gets help and that you have a long and happy marriage.," Stacy, Becky tells me that you two are both real estate agents.", That must be fun., Uh-huh.," Any cool stories you got, huh? Um What do you mean? Like, I don't know, anything weird or funny happen when you guys are showing people houses? Um One time, I forgot my keys to one of the houses."," Whoa! Oh, my God, you do that, too? Yeah.", I've done that., That's the worst.," Then you have to drive all the way back, and then you have to be like, ""I forgot my keys."," "" And then they're like, ""You did that twice."," "" Look at these guys! The key-forgetting twins! I'll be right back."," Can I settle up, please? Dude."," What is your problem? What? Becky and Stacy are both really into you, and you're blowing it with them.", And that's making them lose interest in me., Becky and Stacy are boring.," I need you back there, man."," I've seen you hook up with more trashy chicks in the last year than I can count, all right? If there was a Tellenson Award for hooking up with trashy chicks all the time, you'd have several of those awards.", You're the king., You're my hero.," Tom, I'm gonna get out of here."," I'll see you Monday, okay? Hey.", Hi., Come on in.," I just wanted to tell you that I didn't go through with it, blackmailing that woman."," I tried, but I just couldn't do it.", Good., That's a good thing., It wasn't you.," You know, there was definitely some truth about that thing you said about me and Andy.", No., What? Yeah., I'm sorry.," Me, too.", Oh., Whoa! Hey! What the hell? Oh.," Hi, Leslie.", I thought you were a dude., The people who win awards aren't always the best people.," I mean, I think Ann and I are really good people, and someday others will see that and we'll get our due.", Would I like to win a Tellenson Award like my mom did? Sure.," But my dad never won an award, and he was always happy."," He lives in Florida, in a cemetery."," The point is, my mom is alive and I love her.", She's one tough cookie.," That's why everybody calls her ""The Iron of Pawnee."," "" Fondly."," Yes, I'm married.", But my wife understands that a good politician has to be appealing to the ladies., The fact that I haven't even gotten close to cheating on her is a disappointment to both of us., You like the color orange? Carrots? You into those?   ,"
                ",Season: 1 Episode: 06,This is very exciting.,"We are at Saint Joseph's Medical Center because, today, Andy Dwyer is getting his casts off.","It is a great day for Andy, and it's a wonderful day for my subcommittee.","Oh, my God.",Your boobs are dead.,Stop it.,"No, they're not.",Yeah.,Yay!,"Wow, it's like a sweaty pinata.","Hey, my iPod!","Oh, yeah!",My pirate!,"Doctor, if I may, could I keep that cast, please?","It's a highly disgusting request, but I don't see why not.",Thank you.,"This is a symbol of new beginnings, a symbol of hope, and of our project.",We will build this park!,"It is gonna feel so good to walk again, finally.",Easy!,"Oh, no!","Oh, my Oh, no!","Yeah, they might be a little weak at first.","Thank you, guys.","Welcome back into the world of walking, Andy.",Yes.,"I just wanted to say Quiet, everyone!",Ann wants to say something.,I wanted to thank you all for being so supportive.,"When Andy fell in the pit, I didn't expect anyone in government to reach out to us.","So, thanks.",You're welcome.,"Hey, you're welcome, Ann.","Babe, when are you gonna tell them about my show?","Oh, yeah, sorry.",Andy's band is playing a show.,And we want you all to come.,"It's gonna be a party, so check your suits at the door.",It's gonna get crazy.,"Andy's band is really good, and it's been driving him nuts that he can't play.",He's been writing all these songs about things that are physically near him.,Sandwich!,Are you turkey or ham?,Ham.,Lamp!,Wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched What kind of music does your band play?,"You know, I don't really like to define it, but it's like Matchbox Twenty meets The Fray.","So, rock.","Well, again, I don't really like to define it.",I totally get what you mean.,"So, I would love to come to this thing.",When is it?,Tonight at 8:00.,No!,Tonight?,Yeah.,I can't go.,Why not?,My mom set up this meeting.,It's like a political ttette with a local bigwig.,"Leslie, you're not gonna go?",Come on!,"Oh, you guys.",You know how I love mixing work into my personal life.,"This guy is important, and he has valuable information that could help us build a park.",But I wanna go to the concert!,Come on!,Play hooky!,Blow off the meeting.,"Oh, I wanna go to that concert so bad, but I have to go to the meeting.",I have to go.,"But I'll meet up with you guys after the ttette, I promise.","Hey, Mark, congratulations.",Oh.,"Thanks, Nate.",For what?,You got that speed bump thing taken care of.,Finally.,Nice work.,"Oh, yeah.",Yay.,There used to be this huge speed bump in the center of town.,It was insane.,"So, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I got it lowered 2 inches.","Apparently, what I can achieve in government can literally be measured.","Hey, Dr.",Harris.,"Andy's playing a show tonight, and we'd love it if you came by.",I think there's gonna be a good turnout at Andy's show tonight.,He wrote this new song about what happened to him called The Pit.,"It's one of those rare songs that rocks really hard, and also informs people about a small public works project.","So, Andy's doing well?","Yeah, he's a little shaky still, but that's to be expected.","Well, not really.","If he had his casts removed two weeks ago, the muscles wouldn't have atrophied so much.","I'm sorry, two weeks ago?",That's when they were scheduled to come off.,But he told me that you told him he should wait.,No.,He rescheduled.,"Said it was personal, that he'd explain later, but then he never explained.",I have waited on him hand and foot for two months.,"Well, I guess that explains it.","AND Y Hey, what's up, people of Pawnee?",All right!,All right.,"Uh In just a minute, Scarecrow Boat is gonna rock it out.",Please be patient while we rock out the equipment setup.,AND Y The band has had a few different names over the years.,"We started, we were Teddy Bear Suicide, but then we changed it to Mouse Rat.",Uh.,"Then we were God Hates Figs, Department of Homeland Obscurity, Flames for Flames, Muscle Confusion, Nothing Rhymes with Orange, then Everything Rhymes with Orange, Punch Face Champions, Rad Wagon, Puppy Pendulum, Possum Pendulum, Penis Pendulum, Hand Rail Suicide, Angel Snack, Just the Tip, Three Skin Jet Black Pope, we went back to Mouse Rat, and now we are Scarecrow Boat.","God, when I hear myself say Scarecrow Boat out loud, I kind of hate it.","Now, you know that we're gonna be building a park on a residential lot, so, of course we're gonna have to get the zoning codes approved and amended by our city council.",What kind of movies do you like?,Huh?,Uh.,"Well, you know, documentaries, political thrillers.",I like all kinds of movies.,Great.,"So, I brought some pictures of the lot, and you can tell that the houses are very close to it.",How difficult is rezoning in your town?,Could you go into detail a little bit about that?,Sure.,Great.,It's refreshing to be with someone who actually likes talking about government issues.,Most of the women I go out with find it boring.,"Well, you know, you have to have zoning codes, or else the whole thing could be chaos.",Your mother mentioned that you don't date much.,What?,I've been focusing on my career.,Why do you ask?,I haven't been dating much either since my divorce.,It hasn't been easy.,"And I'm coping, but it was tough on the kids.","Not my kids, 'cause they're grownup, but it was tough on their kids.",Shouldn't bring up my divorce on a first date.,But I feel I can tell you anything.,Uh I think it's going quite well.,And she looks like a young Sandy Duncan.,"Hi, Mom.",He thinks we're on a date.,Did you tell him we were on a date?,"MARLENE Honey, if I told you it was a date, you never would've gone.",You're not getting any younger.,"Well, neither is he.",And he's 62 years old.,Oh.,Just go back in there and finish the dinner.,You don't have to have sex with him if you don't want to.,What?,Are you crazy?,"Hi, how are you?","Hey, Parks Department.","Hey, Mark.","This is Beth, my exwife Tammy's betterlooking sister.",Nice to meet you.,Nice to meet you.,You guys are together?,Yup.,My exwife Tammy cheated on me.,Then we divorced.,"Then last week, I ran into her sister Beth here.","Turns out she hates Tammy, too, so we've started dating.",It's like a fairy tale.,"Yeah, Tammy stinks.",Brendanawicz!,"Hey, Tom.",Hey.,I want you to meet my wife.,Hi.,I'm Wendy Haverford.,Hi.,You're Tom's wife.,Don't hold it against me.,Look at how hot she is.,Isn't that crazy?,And she's a surgeon.,She makes a ton of money!,Bam!,This is Derek.,Cool.,How long have you guys been dating?,We're just friends.,He's like the gayest person I've ever met.,But I make out with him when I'm drunk sometimes.,"You know, if you don't wanna talk to me, you can just say so.",I don't wanna talk to you.,"Apparently, tonight, I'm the Parks Department's seventh wheel.",This is my oldest son.,He's a very nononsense person like yourself.,And this is my youngest.,He's about your age.,Terrific.,"So, did you give any more thought to those zoning code questions I asked you?",Oh.,"Come on, enough business.",Let's have some fun!,Try some of my chicken.,"Oh, no.",That's okay.,Just a taste.,Have a little taste of chicken!,Just a bit!,Just a taste!,"Chicken, chicken, chicken!",Mmm.,"Delicious, right?",Mmmhmm.,I really like this restaurant.,Yeah.,It's a great place for a business meeting.,Andy.,Andy.,We need to talk.,"Babe, hey.",We're just about to start.,Could you grab me a triple whiskey water?,"You would like that, wouldn't you?",Yep.,You have two perfectly good legs.,Get it yourself.,All right.,"Hey, guys!",Thanks for coming out.,We're Scarecrow Boat.,This first song is called Menace Ball.,"Two, three, four I know you been changing But I been changing, too You say that you've moved on Thank you.",What kind of movies do you like?,You already asked me that.,Oh.,Sorry.,Senior moment.,"Hey, am I keeping you from something?","No, no.",Yes.,"My friend Andy is playing in a band tonight, and I kind of wanted to go.","Well, if you want to go to the rock show, I don't mind.",Really?,Are you sure?,Sure!,I haven't been to a rock show in a long time.,The last rock show I went to was the Everly Brothers.,Hmm.,You like the Everly Brothers?,They're my favorite rock group.,They're so good.,I am getting very positive signals.,"You and me together You and me forever You and me together forever Together forever All right, take five, guys.",I'm gonna go acoustic.,"This next song is dedicated to her, my girlfriend, Ann.",I call it Ann.,"Ann Hey, the band's really good.",I liked that song Grapple Hound.,Gossip Town?,Right.,"My only criticism, I hate the name of the band.","Yeah, they should change their name to Big, Lying Baby.",Or Where's My Sandwich?,Or Don't Forget To Bring Home Beers After Work.,Okay.,"Since you brought it up, I'm just gonna say it.","I don't get you and I mean, it doesn't make any sense to me.","I mean, I like Andy a lot.",But there's tons of guys out there who have jobs and who respect you and think you're attractive.,Really?,"Oh, yeah.",You mean guys like you No!,for instance?,"No, no, no, no, no, not me.",Oh.,Okay.,"Good, 'cause, for a second there, I thought you were hitting on me in front of my boyfriend.",No!,Not my style.,"Even though you did just call him a big, lying baby.",And I do find you attractive.,"So, you are hitting on me.",No.,I'm not.,I promise you.,"But if I were, would you be interested?",No.,Okay.,"Let me tell you why, because I'm in a crappy mood, and I don't really appreciate what's happening right here.","Number one, you've never been in a relationship that's lasted longer than a week.","Number two, the girls That's fine.",Just you do choose to spend the week with That's enough.,That's enough.,"Look, I was not trying to ask you out, I promise.","Well, I'm glad we avoided that.",Pit!,"I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit Pit!","I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in that pit Thank you very much, everybody!",We are Scarecrow Boat!,No!,Screw it!,We are Mouse Rat!,Thank you very much!,Good night!,Damn it.,I missed it?,Leslie!,Who's your friend?,I'm George.,I'm Leslie's date.,Yes.,He's my date.,George Gernway.,He's the City Manager in Eagleton.,"Hi, George Gernway.",I'm Tom Haverford.,"This is my wife, Wendy.",She's my age.,Hi.,Hello.,AND Y I have no idea why Ann is upset with me.,But I do know she's too nice to yell at me in front of all these people.,"So, I am not leaving this bar.","So, I heard you went to Indiana State.",Yes.,My buddy Todd went there.,Maybe you know him.,What year did you graduate?,Oh!,"Todd graduated in 2005, so you probably missed him.",How was your date with Leslie?,"We change the band name, and then we send the demo out.","We're completely ready Andy, let's go.","Honey, I'm just debriefing with the band.",It's just gonna be just one second.,Hey!,Hi!,Whoa!,Leslie Knope!,I'm so glad you made it.,You have to meet my band.,Okay.,"Hi, band!",Hey.,What's going on?,Oh.,I'm so sorry that I missed your songs.,Is there any way that you guys could do like an encore or something?,An encore.,I like it.,"Guys, let's get our stuff out of the boxes.",Let's go.,"No, no, forget it.","No, we're going home.","No, don't leave.",I just got here.,"Yeah, she's here with her dad.",It'd be kind of rude to not do at least one more song.,Andy.,"Okay, let's go.",Let's go.,"Sorry, Leslie.",We're gonna go.,I'll call you tomorrow.,Okay.,"This weekend, guys.",Look.,Dead or asleep?,Dead or asleep?,George.,George!,Oh.,"Look at me, out like a light.",I think I should head home now.,Okay.,It was nice to meet you.,It was fun.,I had a nice time.,Don't think I'll go out with her again.,There was just no spark.,How did Leslie meet her boyfriend?,She used to read him books at the senior center.,Wow.,How old is he?,"He's six, but he has Benjamin Button Disease.",Whoa.,"Hey, who wants to see me climb a tree?",I do!,I do!,Deputy Director Knope.,Where do you think you're going?,Home.,It's been a really crappy night.,Have a beer with me.,I can't believe my mom tried to set me up with an 80yearold man.,I went to dinner tonight with somebody's grandpa.,You know what?,That guy was too young for you., You should be dating guys in their early hundreds.," I'm telling you, you should be dating men that Al Roker announces their birthdays.", Hey! Congratulations are in order., I heard that you got that speed bump thing through., Don't make fun of me., I'm not.," Oh, yeah.", I made a bump into a smaller bump., It's a great day for America., What are you talking about? That thing was a pain in the butt., You fixed a problem., That's what we're supposed to do., Mark and I are really connecting tonight., Like we connected that night when we made love five years ago., There's actually a lot of similarities between those two nights., That time we were also at a bar., And he was also pretty drunk.," If you could put anything in the park, what would you put in there? Okay Don't over-think it."," Keep it simple, nice shady trees, lots of grass, benches.", A picnic table? Sure., Water feature.," Like, huge rocks to be climbing on.", A play area for the kids.," God, that sounds wonderful.", I would live in that park., But then you'd be homeless.," Hey, we're closing up.", Oh., What time is it? I should go.," No, no, no, no, no, no, no! We're getting drinks to go.", Come on., Beers to go! Where are we going? All the bars are closed.," You think I can get my beer bottle in that shopping cart right there? What? Mark, don't.", This pit isn't a dump.," Yes, it is."," Look around, Leslie."," I mean, there's crap everywhere.", One beer bottle is not gonna make any difference.," Damn it! I was so close there! Yeah, so It was pretty close! So far to the left! So far to the left! You think you can do any better? No, please."," I don't want anyone to see! I'm the Deputy Director of Parks You're the Deputy Director of Parks and blah blah You know, nobody's gonna see it.", Go on and chuck it.," Unbelievable! That's unbelievable! You missed the entire pit, which is huge, by the way.", I didn't do anything wrong., You didn't do anything wrong? Mmm-mmm., I waited on you hand and foot.," And it was exhausting! I fed you meals, and you could've had your casts off two weeks ago! That is not true.", It's not true? So you're calling Dr., Harris a liar? Yes., I'm gonna call Dr., Harris right now., How about that? You call him! You get me on the phone with Dr., Harris., Yes., Yes., I will., Don't call him right now! Why? Because it's late.," Listen, just put the phone down.", Fine! You want the truth? Yes.," Could I have gotten my casts off two weeks ago? Technically, yes."," But I really, really like it when you serve me food.", Get out., Get out of my house.," But what Take a walk with your overly-healed legs, and let me think about this relationship."," Okay, this pit.", Give it to me straight.," Are we ever gonna turn it into a park? Leslie, this is already a park! Look, I mean, you got Dirt Slide over here, you got Ring Around The Diaper you could play there."," You've got Duck, Duck, Glass you could play right there.", Mystery Trash.," What's not to love about this park, right here, now? I wish we could turn it into a pit, frankly, don't you? But, seriously, I mean, really? Honestly, Leslie, it's gonna be a long, uphill battle.", You are gonna be super annoyed with all the people that want you to fail.," There is a sea of red tape, endless roadblocks."," So, yeah, I don't know.", I don't know., Screw it., I'm gonna try to do it anyway.," I mean, Kennedy put a man on the moon.", He did., I can build one park., I really admire your tenacity., I really admire you.," No, no."," Wait, what am I doing? This isn't the way I want this to happen again."," Leslie, it's not that big a deal."," I think you should go home, Mark."," All right, okay.", I'm sorry., I'm gonna get out of here., Yeah., I'm sorry.," It's okay, it's No."," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Mark, are you all right? Wow."," Are you okay? Oh, my God! Go get some help.", Help! Go get some help., Help! Go get some help.," Help! Hey, babe! Baby, open up! That guy Mark just fell in the pit! What? You know that guy Mark? Yeah.", He just fell in the pit! You gotta go check it out., You're a nurse., I think he'd probably be hurt.," Seriously, it's pretty bad! Pit! I fell in it, the pit You fell in it, the pit We all fell in it, the pit The pit! I fell in it, the pit   ","
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 01,"Okay, here's the situation.",Your parents went away on a week's vacation.,They left the keys to the brand new Porsche.,Would they mind?,"Well, of course not.","I'll just take it for a little spin And maybe show it off to a couple of friends I'll just cruise around the neighborhood Well, maybe I shouldn't Yeah!","Of course I should Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot Pulled up to the corner at the end of my block That's when I saw this beautiful girlygirl walking I picked up my car phone To perpetrate like I was talking Sunroof was open, the music was high And that girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car I can't believe it!",I made a mistake But parents are the same No matter time nor place So to all you kids all across the land No need to argue Parents just don't understand Yeah!,All right!,Thank you.,Thank you.,Just a little something I know.,"So, what's up?",Someone is on fire in Ramsett Park.,They need you to get down there right away.,"Oh, my God.",I've been spending the summer doing a lot of zoo promotions.,For he's a jolly good fellow Parrots live a very long time.,So we had a birthday party for a parrot that turned 60.,"which nobody can deny Chimpanzees are very smart, so we had them graduate from college.","And they like to fling their feces, so we were hoping that they would fling their hats.",But they just flung their feces.,"The Pawnee Zoo recently purchased two South African blackfooted penguins, Tux and Flipper.","And as part of our zoo promotion, we are going to give them a marriage ceremony, because they mate for life.","Tux, do you take Flipper, to be your lawfully wedded wife?",I do!,I do!,"By the power vested in me from the Department of Parks and Recreation, I now pronounce you husband and wife!",Oh!,"Okay, well, at least they're married.",Are they making babies?,"Well, not those two.",Those are both boy penguins.,I'm sorry?,Tux and Flipper are both boys.,"So you should have pronounced them husband and husband, technically.",That's awesome.,"Still, you couldn't have asked for better weather.","Brendanawicz, you big sandwich eater.","Oh Cut it out, now.","Just to be clear, that was a friend punch.",There was no flirtatious meaning behind that playful punch I just gave your arm.,"Yes, I do understand.",You've made it abundantly clear that there's no romantic element to our relationship in any way.,Yes.,Good.,Isn't it good to be able to just kind of horse around like this as friends?,It is.,Yeah.,Yeah.,I really hit rock bottom that night.,And I mean that I literally fell to the bottom of a pit and hit a rock.,"I remember laying there thinking, ""There's probably a good reason why I'm down here and single.",""" And then I started thinking, ""I need morphine.",""" Oh, yeah, I hear you made two male penguins very happy today.","You're making history, Knope.",I like that.,"Sticking your neck out, you know.","No, I didn't stick my neck out.",It was an accident.,Out of the mainstream.,I think that's cool.,I'm in the mainstream.,"Yeah, I know.","No, no.",Not out of it.,Social activism.,No!,Uhuh.,People in this town don't really like their government employees being activists.,"Last year, a garbage man was suspended for wearing a Live Strong bracelet.","Hey, Leslie, some guy who owns a gay bar sent you a cake.",Pawnee has a gay bar?,Yeah.,The Bulge.,It's behind my house.,The Bulge is a gay bar?,"Uh, the nights I've wasted there.","""Leslie!","Hey, girrrrrrrrl!",""" With eight R's.","""Thank you for supporting the cause of gay marriage.","""You rock!",The boys at The Bulge.,""" They thought that was a political gesture?","Okay, nobody eat that cake.",Tom?,Step into my office.,That's also my office.,"Yeah, whatever.",I know that you are not gay.,"No, I'm not.",But you're effeminate.,What?,"Well, you're wearing a peach shirt with a coiled snake on it.","Yes, 'cause it was featured in Details magazine.",And it's awesome.,Effeminate.,"Anyway, so the point is, do you think that marrying penguins made some kind of statement?",Yes.,The statement was that you're very lonely and you need a pet.,Huh.,Leslie?,"They sent you Tshirts, too.",Oh!,"Wow, look, they sent us a Tshirt.",Hmm Mine has a collar on it.,There she is.,Leslie!,Hey!,Hey.,"This is my boyfriend, Derek, and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben.",Hi.,Hey.,Oh!,"Wait, sorry, what's the situation?",What do you mean?,How does this work?,"Derek is gay, but he's straight for me, but he's gay for Ben, and Ben's really gay for Derek.",And I hate Ben.,It's not that complicated.,No.,Oh.,Yeah.,Sure.,"The thing about youth culture is, I don't understand it.",So what can I do for you guys?,"They just really wanted to meet you, because you're kind of like their hero now.","Oh, oh, April, please, it was just penguins.",APRIL: No!,"I'm a public servant, and I'm not allowed to take a political stance.","But you did, and it was awesome.",Yeah.,"None of the other politicians ever take a stand, and it means a lot to the whole gay community.","It does, and we're gonna have this party tomorrow night at The Bulge, and we had something to ask you.",We really want you to be the guest of honor.,"Oh, my.",It'd be amazing if you came.,"Yeah, you have to come.",Who made this?,We did.,"Yeah, we did.",How?,Photoshop.,What?,Oh!,Computers.,"Hey, why are you all dolled up?",It's a long story.,I'm the guest of honor at this gay bar tonight.,I guess gay men are starting to like me.,I don't know.,I guess they think I'm fabulous or something.,"Well, you look good, girl.",You're gonna turn somebody tonight.,That was handsdown the best interaction I've ever had with Donna.,"Leslie, this is Marcia Langman from the Society For Family Stability Foundation.","Oh, hello.",I love your top.,"Oh, thank you so much.",I was just hoping you had a moment to discuss the events at the zoo yesterday.,"Well, I have nothing to do with this, so Well, what can I do for you and those fine people at the SFSF?","Well, you could resign, if you're up for it.","Oh, you're serious?","When you performed a marriage for gay penguins, using taxpayer money on government property, you were symbolically taking a stand in favor of the gay marriage agenda.","Oh, I'm sorry, but hold on a second there, Marcia.","That was not my intention, at all.","Well, why else would you marry penguins?",Because I firmly believed that it would be cute.,And it was.,"Leslie, are you married?",No.,"Not yet, Marcia.","Soon, probably.","I have a plan, but, no, not now.",Not dating anyone yet.,Focusing on my career.,I thought so.,"So you couldn't possibly understand, but when gays marry, it ruins marriage for the rest of us.","So, either you annul the wedding, or I'll publicly ask for your resignation.",You know what?,I'm so terrible with directions.,"If I'm headed to the parking lot, do I make a left out of here, or do I go right?","It's a left, yeah.",Thank you.,You're welcome.,Annul the wedding!,Hey.,Hi!,"I'm supposed to meet Leslie for lunch, but she actually works, so Ouch!",Mark was brought to my hospital the night of the accident.,He was here for a week.,"I think when his head hit the ground, it must've knocked something loose, because he's actually a pretty nice guy now.","And Andy, after we broke up, he told me he was going to Kansas to climb mountains.","So, I don't really know where he is.","Hey, have you seen that documentary about food yet?","No, I haven't.",But I heard it's really good.,I want to see it.,We should go together.,What?,"Yeah, no.",I don't think so.,That would be like a date.,Okay.,Say no more.,Mmm.,I hate salad.,"Leslie, I don't want to ever keep secrets from you.","Oh, me, neither.","Look, let's invent our own secret language that only we understand.",And then we can use it around people and no one will know what we're talking about.,Okay.,Okay.,"But in the meantime, I'm just gonna tell you in English.",Mark kind of asked me out.,"He weirdly asked me to go see a movie with him, and I said no, of course, but I just I just wanted to let you know.",I'm feeling a lot of confusing things right now.,Yeah.,"No, of course you are.",And your friendship is the most important thing to me.,And he's offlimits.,Thank you.,"I just want to let you know, I was really serious about that secret language.",I know.,I can't believe this is a gay bar.,"Yeah, especially with that heterosexual cowboy greeting us on the way in.",Where should I drink now?,There's a bar on Eighth Street called Pitchers and Catchers.,You can go there.,Yeah.,Hey!,"Okay, listen.",Here's the plan.,"Our position is, we have no position.","So let's just say, ""Thank you for the party, ""but we regretfully decline your offer to honor me.",""" Oh, my God, I can't believe you came.","Hi, April.",Derek!,It's Leslie Knope.,"Leslie Knope, you're my hero!",Oh!,That's nice.,"Leslie, you are looking hot.",Really?,"Thank you, Ben.",I'm really enjoying this hug.,"That's so nice, but I need to tell you something.",This one is on us.,"Well, if it's free Leslie Knope!","She's Leslie Knope, and she wants to recruit you!","No, no, no.","Oh, my.",Okay.,"Please, please, please, please.",Gentlemen.,"First of all, I would just like to say thank you so much for throwing me this party, especially on a night when the Colts are playing.","We love you, Leslie!",Okay.,This is green.,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Okay!,"Well, I wanted to tell you that I wasn't really trying to take a stand when I married those penguins.",Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,You're chanting my name.,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,I just have one thing to say!,Together we can change Pawnee forever!,Let's dance!,"Leslie Knope's in the building, y'all!",Let's get wild!,"I've seen so many dudes from City Hall here tonight, it's crazy.","But I guess they've seen me here, too.","So, that's not great.",Hey!,Hi.,I got your text.,Is everything okay?,"Oh, yeah!",They're having a party in my honor!,Go to the bar.,"If you're my friend, you can drink for free!",Oh!,Cool!,"Okay, and maybe next time don't use the words ""medical emergency.",""" I'm so glad you're here!",I'm really sober!,Okay!,Get a drink!,You know why tonight's fun?,'Cause everyone's so gay.,"And they know how to have fun, and the dancing!","Just, it's Everyone is just who they are.",And who they are is just stonecold gay.,"Can't read my Can't read my No, he can't read my poker face Blah, blah, blah, blah My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face My, my, my, poker face My, my poker face I'm having such a nice time tonight.",I've met many interesting people.,"And there's two bisexual guys here, and I got both of their phone numbers.","My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face My, my, my poker face My, my poker face The whole morning.",Show me what's hot Tell me what I got Can't read my Can't read my Have fun last night?,"I had three drinks named after me, so that's pretty fun.","Plus, Ben and Derek are taking me shopping on Saturday.",And we are gonna find out my actual bra size.,I guess I'm kind of like queen of the gays.,Bully for you.,I just got a phone call.,They want you to go on Pawnee Today.,Wow.,That's huge.,What's the topic?,You.,That Marcia Langman from the family thing is calling for your resignation.,No!,You gotta go on and defend yourself.,Why?,I haven't even officially taken a stand on gay marriage.,That's funny.,Somebody just told me you were queen of the gays.,That was me.,"Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo.",It's kind of like the Meet the Press of our town.,"It's the big time, Leslie.","Yeah, I know.",It is.,I'm nervous.,I just wish I were here under different circumstances.,Guess who?,Uh Megan Fox?,One of the Desperate Housewives?,"No, Joan Callamezzo.","Hey, Joanie!","What's up, gorgeous?",Good to see you.,Tom comes on the show all the time.,Joan loves him.,You have the softest skin of any woman in Pawnee.,Thank you.,"I wish you could reach, from your TV screen, and just touch Joan's skin for a second.",That's sweet.,You'd have a treat.,You're pretty soft yourself.,How are your kids doing?,They're pretty good.,Is it tough for them to have a mother that is so beautiful?,What's it like being the most attractive woman in Pawnee?,"You keep up those funnies, I'm gonna have to invite you over for supper.","Well, I'll have to come over for supper.", Oh! You must.," Oh, my God.", Ann Perkins., How you doing? I'm good., How was mountain climbing? What? Can I come in? I just want to talk to you for a second.," Sure, yeah."," We have a controversial topic today, the gay penguin marriage at the Pawnee Zoo."," So, Marcia, what is all the fuss about? The fuss is that Miss Knope claimed that she was not advocating for this gay cause, and then that very night, she was the guest of honor at a pro-gay marriage rally at a bar called The Bulge."," Miss Knope, how do you respond? I'd first like to say that I wasn't trying to advocate for anyone."," I did not know that both of the penguins were males, and I was just trying to perform a cute, fun ceremony to promote our local zoo.", I have to say that that stunt that you did with the penguins was clearly over the line.," Now, Marcia, what, if anything, can Miss Knope do to make it right? Joan, we don't want to be unreasonable.", Of course not.," We think that she should separate the penguins, annul the marriage, reimburse the taxpayers for the cost of the wedding, of course, and then resign.", Oh! Is that it? That would do it.," Anything else? You want me to jump off a building? Perform hara-kiri? Move to a different town? No, I kid.", Full of ideas here today., This is the reason why people don't go into politics.," Because, I bust my ass for the people in this city, and I can't win."," I have one night of fun with some of the best dancers I've ever danced with, and suddenly everybody's freaking out? Wow, look at that! Wow, we're lighting up here.", Great., Let's go for it., Bring it on., I've never seen that on our show before.," How does this work? Well, there Push that, and Great.", Okay.," Hey! You're on the air! You're on the air! Good! Yeah, I think that lady should resign."," Okay, good.", Thank you., Next caller., You should resign and repay your salary.," Okay, two for resign.", Thank you., Next caller.," I just want to say that I love the zoo, and the zoo is really fun.", Thank you., That's really sweet., And I think you should resign., You look great., You look amazing., Thanks., You look fancy.," Oh, yeah, the monkey suit."," Cost 3,000 bucks, but totally worth it."," I sold out! I got a boring office job in town, so I gotta dress up, you know, the grind."," But I'm really happy, and I really feel like I've matured a lot.", Good! That's I'm happy for you., Yeah.," So listen, I was sitting in the cubicle the other day, just doing some thinking, and some growing And some maturing.", Yes! Maturing.," And darn it if I don't just miss you, and Andy."," Well, A-Cakes, just let me I love you, and I'm just really sorry for the way that I treated you."," I was the worst boyfriend ever, I know that, and I really think it would behoove us to give it another shot."," Yeah, look."," I'm really happy for you about your job and that you've learned some new words, but I'm sure about my decision.", Okay., Say no more.," Listen, hit me up on my cell phone.", I'll be around.," And if you wanna talk, or grab coffee or something like that.", Okay? Okay., Oh., Gotta get back to the office., Have a good one., Good seeing you., Bye., And the hardest part about living in this pit is probably keeping my suit pressed., And the rats., It's like a freaking rat parade every night.," I just want to be close to her house, because I need to protect her.", 'Cause there are some weird people that live around here.," Yeah, if you let penguins get married, where does it end? I mean, would you let me marry my guinea pig? Because I really do want to marry my guinea pig.", I'll take my answer off the air., I think that's a valuable point.," Attendance is up 30% at the zoo, by the way.", You're welcome.," That penguin wedding was cute, damn it.", And I'm not gonna annul it., I'd ask you to reconsider.," Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me, because it's not gonna happen, Marcia."," Is that right? Last time I checked, I don't think I murdered anyone, or had an affair, or did drugs! But I apologize."," I apologize for having fun, and for making something cute! Where are you from originally? Oh, no! What did I do? So, you will not be annulling the marriage? No.", I will not be annulling., No., Look at them., They're just in their own little penguin love bubble., I guess that's what it's like when you meet your mate and know you're gonna be together forever., Hi! Hi! You know what I realized? What? We're just animals., We don't know anything about love., Okay., Yeah., I think you should go on that date with Mark.," Oh, Leslie Really, seriously."," I thought about it, and, look, he might not be my gay penguin, but he could be yours."," Look, I told you I'm not going on a date with him."," Okay, fine."," If you don't want to go out with him, don't go out with him."," But don't not do it because of me, because I'm really fine with it.", All that's important to me is that we're still friends.," Me, too! Good! Great."," Plus, I already called him and told him that you were dying to go out with him, so have fun."," Huh? So, I transferred the penguins to a zoo in lowa."," Gay marriage is legal there, so hopefully, they'll be happy.", At least they'll be together.," Oh, look! Six Flags! I should take them on a water slide.", They might die., But it would be so cute!   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 02,I just want to check one last time that you're okay about this date with Mark.,"Oh, my God.","I'm so fine with it, Ann.",Seriously.,It's so fine.,As long as you and I are cool.,You know my code.,Hoes before bros.,Uteruses before duderuses.,Got it.,Ovaries before brovaries.,You make such good coffee.,"Look, I know you're saying you're okay with it, but I've been in this position before, and I had a friend who dated an ex, and I said I was okay, but I wasn't, actually.",It was kind of weird.,"But the thing is, Mark isn't my ex.","You know, we slept together six years ago.","Anyway, I'm over it.",Or am I?,I'm just kidding.,This is one of my greatest brainstorms ever.,"A community garden, right in the middle of the pit.",We're encouraging people to just come out and plant whatever they want.,And Tom and I sometimes get here early and help out.,It's so hot.,I had to get some more iced tea.,People have just really embraced this and planted the coolest stuff.,And Tom is our master horticulturist.,He knows all the scientific names for everything.,"Right, Tom?",Yeah.,Like this.,"What's this, Tom?","Those are, of course, tomatoes, or Soulja Boy Tell 'Ems.","Whenever Leslie asks me for the Latin names of any of our plants, I just give her the names of rappers.",And those over there?,Those are some Diddys.,Those are some Bone ThugsnHarmonyums right here.,Growing beautifully.,Those Ludacrises are coming in great.,"Look, someone planted something new.",What's this?,"What do you think, carrots?","If that's true, we have a garden pest on our hands.",Maybe some kind of spice?,Yeah.,"You know, Leslie, the best way to figure out what kind of spice that is, just roll it up into a joint and smoke it.","Ron, did you get my texts?",No.,Did you get my emails?,Mmmmmm.,Did you see that I paged you?,I did not.,Did you check your voicemail?,I didn't.,We have a criminal emergency on our hands.,Someone planted a gateway drug in the community garden.,Okay.,Call the cops.,That'll leak to the press.,"Then there'll be an investigation, and they'll find my fingerprints on the manure, and then we'll lose our funding.",You don't have funding.,And we never will if this gets out.,"Look, I will call the cops, but just give me one day to deal with this internally, okay?",Sure.,Thank you.,"And listen, if this thing blows up, I was never here.",I have a hernia.,I've had it for a while.,"And I've been ignoring it, successfully.","But this morning, I made the mistake of sneezing.","But as long as I sit still and don't move my head, or torso, I'm good, I got this.",We need to find out who we're dealing with.,Who is this person?,Who is this kingpin?,"It's a 13yearold kid named Stevie, who likes to get high, and make his Transformers look like they're having sex together.","I would like to be President someday, so, no, I have not smoked marijuana.",I ate a brownie once.,At a party in college.,It was intense.,"It was kind of indescribable, actually.",I felt like I was floating.,Turns out there wasn't any pot in the brownie.,It was just an insanely good brownie.,"You know, if we catch him, then we avoid a scandal.","'Cause we flip the headline, and it's not ""Community Garden Infested With Pot.",""" It's ""Brave Public Servants Rid Neighborhood of Drugs, ""Earn Praise from Mayor, comma, Everyone.",""" We got to catch this guy.","Get the van, meet me at 7:00.",It's stakeout time.,April?,Yeah?,"Get my lunch for me, please.",Okay.,"Like, order you something?","No, get it.",From there.,Is this some kind of weird power trip?,Please.,Thank you.,That'll be all.,You're welcome.,I have stakeout supplies.,This is stuff that we're probably going to need.,"We have notepads, pencils and pencil case.",Shakable whipped cream.,Cameras.,Pork.,And candy necklaces.,It's like we're real police.,And I made us a mix CD.,It's all filled with songs about people watching people.,It's mostly Sting.,"And look, I put our faces on there.",It's really cool.,Are you going to wear that shirt?,Yeah.,You like it?,Tommy Hilfiger?,No.,Tom Haverford.,I spent 120 bucks to get it monogrammed.,Here you go.,Everyone thinks it's Tommy Hilfiger.,"Well, here.",You should be wearing something like this.,Take this.,Wear black.,Black is what you wear on a stakeout.,"Okay, I have to figure out how this works.",Just let me focus up on this.,Pretty bummed this fits.,"Okay, now I need to just take a test shot and see how this goes.",Test shot.,You ready?,Just focus up on the pit.,All right.,Stop.,Focus up right where the Stop.,Focus up right where the weed is Stop.,Stop.,Leslie swears it's okay.,So I'm going out with Mark.,I got to get back out there.,"When Andy and I used to go to the movies, he would always try to guess the ending of the movie.",And he would always guess that the main character had been dead the whole time.,Even when we saw Ratatouille.,"Oh, look.",It's Mark.,What are you doing?,What?,I'm just checking to make sure this lens works.,Good.,Yeah.,"Hey, Ann.",Hey.,"So, you ready to go?","Oh, no.",I need another hour to get ready.,Seriously?,"'Cause I think the movie starts in like Oh, you're joking around right now.",Wow.,This is going to be fun.,"Yeah, well, you know, with a body like this, you don't get the brains, too.",Ew!,Silly.,Whoa!,Are they

right?",Wow.,No.,I was conceived in America.,My parents are Indian.,Where did the name 'Haverford' come from?,"My birth name is Darwish Sabir Ismael Gani, and I changed it to Tom Haverford because, you know, brown guys with funnysounding Muslim names don't make it really far in politics.",What about Barack Obama?,"Okay, yeah, fine, Barack Obama.","If I knew a dude named Barack Obama was going to be elected President, yeah, maybe I wouldn't have changed it.","Oh, did you hear that noise?","Oh, my God.",It's the kingpin!,Write this down.,"Okay, white male, light brown hair.",Just take pictures.,"Oh, my God, it looks like Andy.",That is Andy.,That is Andy.,Andy is the kingpin.,Andy.,Come here.,"Oh, hey, you guys.",What are you doing here?,It's so good to see you.,Quietly.,What happened?,You're living in the pit now?,"For now, yeah.",It's awesome.,Somebody just planted a garden down there.,"Fruits and vegetables, so I'm getting a lot of vitamins But that's our community garden.","Yeah, and someone planted a whole mess of weed next to the tomatoes.","Oh, don't look at me.",There's weed down there?,I thought that was the tops of carrots.,"Right, I know.","Me, too.","Listen, we're on a stakeout, okay?",So why don't you come to the van and help us?,We're trying to catch the guy.,And maybe you could tell us what you've seen.,I was supposed to have a rock fight with this crazy guy.,He's like 20 minutes late.,All right.,Let's do it.,Okay.,Do you live here?,April?,Yeah.,Do you live here?,No.,Catch.,"Yeah, I thought so.","I went home, but I had this strange feeling that there was something wrong with you, so I came back.",It's just a minor medical issue.,AIDS?,No.,I'm safe.,Blindness?,No.,Is it like a parasite or a virus or something you get from a bee?,I have a hernia.,Do you have syphilis?,I said it's a hernia.,I know.,It's possible to have two things.,Do you need a ride to the hospital?,"Yes, please.",Okay.,"But I rode my bike here, so I have to go home and get my dad's station wagon.",Thank you.,Bye.,Are you still here?,Yeah.,I just wanted to see if you could tell.,Are you still here?,It is really great to have somebody to talk to.,"Man, oh, man.",So how's Ann?,She's doing good?,"Oh, I miss her so much, it's ridiculous.",How's she doing?,Doing good

doesn't seem to matter to the police!",Okay.,Nice job with that.,But let's Let me ask you a question.,Is it the policy of the Pawnee Police Department to arrest people when they try to get into their own van?,No.,"And thankfully, that's not what happened.","Now, could you please go home, and get some sleep, and let this matter be resolved.","Thank you, Officer.","Let's just go home,

Can I call you Dave? My mother likes David, but I'm pretty split on it 50-50."," Hate to break it to you, Dave.", You really stepped in it.," What? I'm a government employee, David, and so is your prisoner."," If I wanted to, I could get on the horn, and I could have Ron Swanson down here, kicking down your doors."," Yeah, that's right.", You heard me., Ron Swanson., What branch of government are you in? Parks and Recreation., Parks and Recreation? Yes.," Do I stutter? Look, Ms."," Knope, it wasn't just his behavior, okay? I think your friend might be some kind of a pervert.", No.," Look, that's what people think when they first meet him, but he's all talk."," It's just No, I'm being serious.", We searched the van and we found a lot of disturbing things.," Some professional photography equipment, and these pictures of some people on a date."," We also found an enormous amount of manure, and a very inappropriate amount of candy."," Okay, look.", Tom and I were in that van together.," We were staking out the community garden, because somebody planted marijuana in it."," I brought the candy and I brought a lot of it, because I love candy.", I took the pictures., My best friend was going on a date with my ex-lover., It's been a very long night.," But Tom is not a pervert, and he shouldn't be in jail."," Well, they're going to release him in a little while.", Thank God.," Should I get you guys home right now? You know, you two go ahead.", I'm going to stay here and wait for Tom.," Are you sure? Yeah, prison changes a man.", I think he'll probably want to see a familiar face when he gets back on the outside.," Well, okay, then."," See you, Leslie.", Yo., I had to wait till my dad fell asleep so I could steal his keys., You ready? I was born ready., I'm Ron Swanson., Easy., Care Careful.," Take Ann, I really don't think you should invite me in.", Terrible things happened last time.," So, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.", Okay., Okay., Bye., Hey., You kind of kissed me.," Yes, I did!

Okay.," So, where's that marijuana at? It's down in the garden."," Good meeting you, man! We should grab a drink or something sometime.", I just hope that Ann and Mark got home okay.," That's all that matters, you know? That Ann is home and she's okay.", And that Mark is also okay and he is in his home., Just important that they're both in their homes Leslie., Mark's an idiot., You can do a lot better than him., Forget about him.," Thanks, Tom.", I didn't mean me.," Keep it in your pants, Knope."," I swear to God, it actually It was there These are carrots."," Duh! You don't think I know the difference between carrots and marijuana? Is that the house there, where your best friend lives? Where she saw the van from? Yeah.", Okay., I get it.," What? Well, you wanted to check up on your friend and that guy, your ex, so you made up a story about weed so you could stake out their date."," No, I did not.", There actually was weed here It's okay., I think it's kind of cute., I like Miss Knope., I liked her.," I got to say, I When I first met her I didn't care much for her, because like 99% of the people in any given day of my life, she was very belligerent and disagreeable.", Miss Knope was attractive to me.," As a man, I was attracted to her in her demeanor.", I was attracted to her in a sexual manner that was appropriate., Can we not I don't want to talk about this anymore., What a crazy night.," Huh, partner? Want to go get some breakfast? What? No! Take me home."," What's wrong with you? Oh, my God."," Oh, my God, I can't believe this is on.", I wonder if mini golf is open., Home! Especially if you're going to I know., Anndanawicz! What're you guys doing? Eating? Love it.," Oh, hey, just wanted to thank you for having me arrested as a pervert the other night.", That was cool.," Peace!

daffodils, too.","Donna, you're definitely getting some.",Jerry?,I don't know.,I'm not sure.,Time will tell.,"Also, I'm leaving early tonight because I am a judge in the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant.","Whoa, whoa, whoa.",You get to be a judge in that thing?,"Yes, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously.",But I want to be a judge.,I can't believe you like beauty pageants.,"April, whoever Miss Pawnee is, is gonna be the representative of womanhood in our town.","And as a judge, let me assure you that this year's Miss Pawnee will be chosen for her talent and poise.",Whoa.,The girls from Talent and Poise gonna be there?,What?,Talent and Poise.,It's the strip club by the VA hospital.,I have some meetings there.,That's disgusting.,No.,What's

my.","Thank you so much, April.",Wow!,You're welcome.,"Oh, by the way, completely unrelated, I just signed up for the Miss Pawnee Beauty Pageant.",That's wonderful.,"You know, that is why I decided to become a judge.","So that awesome girls like you, who are not, you know, classically hot, can be rewarded for their intelligence and savvy.",Beauty pageants are idiotic.,But I found out that the winner of the Miss Pawnee Pageant gets $600.,I can be idiotic for $600.,"So, are you gonna vote for me, sister?","April, it's unethical for me to show you favoritism.",You and I are like family.,The coffee is $7.,Yes.,Right.,Of course.,Just bump that clown.,Tell them they already have another Asian judge.,Awesome.,"Thank you so much, I owe you.",All right.,Peace.,Guess who's also gonna be a judge in the beauty pageant?,What?,How?,I know a guy.,I had to call in a few favors.,"But if you don't call in favors to look at women in bikinis and assign them numerical grades, what the hell do you call in favors for?",Hey.,Hey.,Hey.,Hey.,What you doing in these parts?,I just came by to see the murals.,This one's pretty amazing.,"Yeah, this one's a beauty.","You know, in the 1880s, there were a few years that were pretty rough and tumble in Pawnee.","This depicts kind of a famous fight between Reverend Bradley and Anna Beth Stevenson, a widowed mother of seven.","The original title of this was ""A Lively Fisting.",""" But you know, they had to change it for obvious reasons.",She's got him by the hair pretty good there.,Yeah.,"Leslie's really cool, and she's smart.",It's a little intimidating.,"To tell you the truth, I didn't come here to look at the murals.",I came to ask her on a date.,"Hey, Leslie, I really like you.","And I was wondering if maybe you'd want to get a cup of coffee or something, sometime.","Okay, yeah, sure.",Yeah?,Yeah.,Absolutely.,Let me check my schedule.,Okay.,Let's

my friends, I love to laugh, I love the summertime and going to the beach, and I love wearing bikinis at the beach with everyone there.","I just want everyone Well, you know, they can't all be winners.",Are y'all having a good time?,"Looks like we got a frontrunner, guys!","And now it's time for our ever popular talent competition, where our ladies will each demonstrate their excellent skills.","Here we have Leslie's custom scorecard, with categories such as, presentation, intelligence, knowledge of herstory, fruitful gestures, je ne sais quoi, and something called ""The Naomi Wolf Factor.",""" And our first one up is Trish lanetta, whose talent is baton.",My girl Trish is talented.,She's not even twirling the baton.,I'm going to do impressions.,"Oh, celebrity impressions.",That's wild.,Wild stuff.,Yeah.,This is an impression of my sister.,"Hi, I'm Natalie.",I love Ritalin and have low selfesteem.,Thank you.,"This is an impression of my boss, Leslie

good she did earlier.","No, Susan isn't a perfect 10.","But in my mind, Susan is the perfect Miss Pawnee.","Her values are strong, her commitment to her job is very admirable, she has a real sense of Hey, hey!",Over here.,How's it going in here?,Good.,I hooked your toilet up to your shower.,"That's what you wanted, right?",Yes.,Excellent.,Was that Andy?,Andy?,I know you're in there because I can see you through the screen.,Ann!,Hey!,What's up?,What are you doing?,Do you live down here?,What?,What?,Yes.,"Oh, my God.","Oh, my God, you live down here.","Oh, my God.",I can't believe this is happening!,What?,I can't be at my house and see my exboyfriend living in a hole in my backyard like a gopher.,"That's so weird, Andy.","Listen, I have been trying really hard not to bother you.","Like, when you had that barbecue last week, I didn't come up, even though it smelled so good.",You've been here a whole week?,Yes.,One week only.,"Oh, I guess I guess that's the office you were telling me about that you go to work to every day.",Excellent.,Listen.,Are we gonna talk about anything other than the lies that I told you?,I can't do this right now.,I have a guy fixing my bathroom.,I got to go.,"Yeah, that's cool.","I got to zoom out, too, 'cause I have some people coming over.","So, why don't you call first next time?",You know the way out.,"All right, it's time now for the dreaded Q&A.",And the first question goes to Tom Haverford.,"Yes, I have a question for the hot one.","First off, I just want to say I'm a little bit surprised, because I didn't think angels could fly so low.",Thank you.,"You truly are a beautiful, beautiful woman.",You're so funny.,You're funny.,You're funny.,"Do you have a question, Tom?","Okay, I have a real question, if you don't mind, Tom.","Trish, Alexis de Tocqueville called America ""The Great Experiment.",""" What can we do as citizens to improve on that experiment?","Well, uh, I think that America is the land of the free, which is a wonderful thing, and also the brave, where people can live, and no one can ever take that away from you and it never gives up.",But the high birthing rate of immigrants frightens me.,"No offense to anyone out there, but if it were up to me and my family, I would actually call it ""Ourmerica,"" and not ""Theirmerica.",""" Thank you.",Don't applaud that.,"No, she didn't She didn't answer my question.","I'm sorry, you don't think it's weird that my exboyfriend lives in a tent in the pit outside my house?",It's not ideal.,Maybe you should try to relax.,Maybe take one of those Ativans I saw in the medicine cabinet.,Dude!,"Yeah, I peeked.",I also didn't see any toothpaste.,Do you not use toothpaste?,"I mean, I always knew he was lazy, but this is, like, a new low for him.",I feel like we should invite him inside.,Have you not been listening to anything I just said?,"I don't know, it's just It's raining outside, and he's living in a pit, you know?","Okay, folks, just a couple more contestants, and then the judges will decide our next Miss Pawnee, a winner of $600 in gift certificates to Big Archie's Sporting Goods and Emerson Fencing Company.",What?,We don't get cash?,This is for a fence?,"Well, it won't cover a whole fence.",But it will defray the cost considerably!,"Oh, my God.",I quit.,I quit.,"Okay, I guess she really is quitting.","No, I didn't win.",But at least I didn't make any new friendships.,"So, how long do we have to pretend to deliberate until we go back out there?",What do you mean?,We're all in agreement.,"The hot one, by a landslide.","Well, her name is Trish.","And I don't think we should rush this, you know?",What is there to talk about?,"I mean, I thought Trish was just adorable.","Well, take Susan, for example.",I think Susan Boring Stories?,No.,It's Trish.,Let's go back out there.,"Okay, hold on, everyone.",Hold on.,"Everyone, wait, wait, wait.","Look, whoever we choose is going to represent the ideal woman for a year.",She'll be someone that little girls in South Central Indiana look up to.,"Now, nobody leaves this room until we discuss all of it.",Okay?,Consider yourselves sequestered.,"I'm a judge, so I don't want to sound partial.",But Trish will win this pageant over my dead body.,"Look, I am the only one here who has entered and won this contest in the past.",And I think Trish is a nobrainer.,"Jessica, may I ask, what was your talent?","Oh, I packed a suitcase.","I have to say, Leslie does make a good point.",Trish is not the brightest bulb in the bunch.,"Yes, Ray.","Good, I like what you're saying.",Let's keep talking.,Just stand over there and don't drip on anything.,"Is Mark the guy who's ""fixing your shower""?","I don't know about you, Mark, but I've seen a ton of porn.","And I know what ""fixing your shower"" means.","Andy Sorry, you guys are on a date.",That's cool.,Andy?,"No, it's all right.",Don't let me interrupt your date.,Keep eating.,I already ate.,I'm super full.,I don't I don't want any.,"Okay, so, it's still 32 for Trish.","Guys, all I ask is that you look into your hearts, and think, really think, about what you've seen and ask yourselves, ""Who is the most impressive woman here tonight?",""" It's the hot one.",Trish lanetta!,These are amazing.,Do you Do you put a little hot sauce on these or something?,A good chef never reveals her secrets.,It's hot sauce.,Ann is an extraordinary cook.,Mmm.,Memories.," Do you want some more? Are you hungry still? You know what's funny? I was just sitting over here on the couch and I was thinking, that there was once a time when Mark used to be the stranger in the house.", And now it's me.," Excuse me, everyone.",  Why don't we just take a moment to give a round of applause to all the contestants this evening? Yes., Especially Susan.," This isn't the first time that Susans have lost to Trishes, and it won't be the last."," Susan and I will continue on until the women of Pawnee are judged not by the flatness of their tummies, but by the contents of their brains."," And, Trish, I may not have voted for you, but now is the time for us to come together."," I hope you honor this crown with dignity, and a devotion to all One, two, three! One, two, three! As usual, Ann, a delicious meal.", Are we doing anything in the way of dessert or coffee? We are leaving.," Okay, I get it.", Don't worry., I'm very good at picking up signals.," Let's go, Mark."," No, dummy.", Just you., Okay., All right., Take care of yourself.," Just don't worry about me, Ann.", Okay? I'll be fine.," That went really well! We had dinner! I got to see her! Oh, God, I was so tempted to look back at her.", Was she looking? I had to walk so slow., A good day.," Well, well, well, look who's here.", It's Officer John McClane.," Welcome to the party, pal.", Who's that? Die Hard., The battery? Hey.," What are you doing here? Well, you know the other day I asked you if you wanted to have coffee? Yeah.", You said yes., Yes.," Okay, and then afterwards, I saw you again, you kind of acted like you didn't want to have coffee anymore.", We left it kind of open-ended., We did., And that's made me uncomfortable., Okay.," So I thought I'd come in and ask you, and just get some clearance on this."," Dave, I like you."," I like you, too."," Okay, so, we'll get coffee, then.", But I'm just busy.," Right now, my schedule is just so full.", Okay.," Okay, I get it."," Look, I'm not a guy who plays games."," Okay, I just came to tell you that I like you, and I like coffee and I If you want to get some coffee, here's my number."," Hey, coming through, buddy.", Hey., I got your message., Hey., Thanks for coming.," Look, I'd love to go out with you.", How about Friday for dinner? Yeah? Great.," Hey, will Sandra Day O'Connor and Michelle Obama and Condoleezza Rice and Nancy Pelosi, are they gonna join us? No, they will not be joining us."," Okay, well, good, 'cause I don't happen to agree with Miss Pelosi's views about the Troubled Assets Relief Program.", Hmm., I looked that up to impress you., I figured., Yeah.," If you guys like grilling, you want to come over and use my grill Look, let me do you a favor.", Take a key.," Just come by, grill up whatever you want.", This is one of my favorite pick-up strategies., I'm constantly giving one of my keys., This is your house key? Yeah., I just happened to have a spare.," Just come by, go for a dip, whenever you want."," So far, none of them have shown up."," That's a very appealing offer, thank you.", Matter of time.," Hey, Craig."," Hey, Tommy."," Fifty more copies, please.", You got it., I have been robbed twice.,   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 04,"And to my wife, I apologize.","All I can say is I wasn't just having sex, I was making love to a beautiful woman and her boyfriend, and a third person, whose name I never learned.","Furthermore, it was wrong of me to say I was building houses for the underprivileged, when I was actually having fourway sex in a cave in Brazil.",I bet cave sex is insane.,Why?,Because of the echoes and the humidity.,Mmmhmm.,"In my defense, it was my birthday and I really wanted to do it.",I think it's a real shame when people focus on the tawdry details of a scandal.,"Personally, all I care about is Councilman Dexhart's policies.",Not whether he was high on nitrous and cocaine during the cave sex.,"Which, by the way, I heard he was.",One more shocking revelation in a story that just won't stop unfolding.,It turns out Councilman Dexhart may have also had sex with a prostitute in the limousine on the way to and from the press conference where he apologized for having an affair.,"Perd Hapley, Channel Four Eyewitness News.",Why does anybody wanna run for public office?,You're just asking to have your entire life exposed.,"Well, if

just don't enter the cave.",Am I right?,Up top!,"I'm sure that you think that you're clean, but I bet that we could find something on you.","I changed my name, which is legal, and once in high school, a girl beat me in a wrestling match.",That's it.,I bet anything I could find worse stuff on all you guys.,Are you suggesting a game?,I'm in.,I'm in.,I'm out.,"Not an option, Jerry.",You're going down.,"No, seriously, I really don't wanna play.","No, no.","Seriously, you are playing.",We're gonna nail you.,"I will play, too, if only to prove that I can find more dirt on you than you can on me.",That's why we're all playing.,Your desk is over there.,I love games that turn people against each other.,You guys will never believe what I just found on Jerry's Facebook.,A friend.,Burn.,"Okay, again, I'd really rather not play.","Hey, guys.",What are you guys doing?,Trying to see who has the least amount of dirt on them in case someone wants to run for office.,"Well, it ain't Jerry.",That's for sure.,What?,"Well, he's got a couple of 359s on him.",Public urination.,I don't like this game.,I just don't like it.,He's probably gonna go angerpee in the courtyard.,"Well, you crazy park people, I'm out of here.","Leslie, I'll see you tomorrow.","Tomorrow, will be our first official First date.",Roger that.,Copy.,Over and out.,Dave and I are going on our first date tomorrow.,I'm not nervous.,Why should I be nervous?,We're just two people going on a first date.,There's nothing to be nervous about.,That was my phone.,Hey.,Hey.,Hi there.,What are you What are you doing here?,Just having lunch with Leslie.,What are you up to?,"Oh, I'm looking for scandalous information about my coworkers, for a game that we're playing.","My taxes pay your salary, right?",Yeah.,Cool.,"And he looked up at me, and he said, ""Thank you.",You saved my life.,""" Yeah.","Hey, listen, I'm really nervous about this date tomorrow night.","Do you have, like, a first date outfit I can borrow?","Like, I don't know, a pair of cargo pants?","Yeah, I wouldn't go with a cargo pant.","What about, like, a sexy hat?",I don't know what that even is.,Helping already.,Do you wanna just come by after work today?,Sure.,Yeah.,Tonight?,Several hours from now?,Or you could just come over now?,I think that would be better.,"Yeah, that would give us more time.",Let's go.,"Oh, what you doing, guys?",Looking for dirt on me?,No point.,Give up now.,"Oh, wait, there's this.","Everybody, I bought a Croissan'wich this morning.",This isn't even a real receipt.,Just a scrap of paper.,Taliban robes!,What?,Where'd you get that photo from?,"Hey, Tom.",Nice Taliban robes.,Those aren't Taliban robes.,"That's from Halloween, 10 years ago.",I was dressed like a Jedi.,I'm sure that the voters would be able to tell the difference.,"Mmm, looks to me like you're in the Taliban.","Well, did everybody know that Ron's exwife, Tammy, is actually his second exwife named Tammy?",That's right.,"Ron has two exwives, each named Tammy.",Both of them bitches.,"Yes, my mom's name is Tammy.",What's your point?,"Tom, that was a Jaegersecret.",You just breached a Jaegersecret.,"Damn, this just heated up quick!",Tada!,That looks great.,Yeah?,"Will you be wearing it out of the store today, madame?","I think I will, good lady.","Hey, while I have you, can I ask you a question?",Shoot.,What if he asks me if I've been married?,Have you?,No.,"Well, then, say that.",But then he'll wonder why I haven't been married.,You know what I'm gonna do?,I'm gonna say that I was married.,"The real question is, should I say that I have kids.","Guys like girls that have kids, right?",Whoa!,What if I get drunk and I talk about Darfur too much?,Or not enough?,What if I don't bring up Darfur enough?,"Leslie, relax.",Yeah.,Okay?,"I just have a few more questions for you, Ann.",What if he shows up with another woman?,What if one of my sleeves catches on fire and it spreads rapidly?,"What if instead of Tic Tacs, I accidentally pop a couple of Ambien and I have to keep punching my leg to stay awake?",Those are all insane hypotheticals.,And I promise you they won't happen.,They have happened.,All of these have happened to me.,"No, there's more.","One time, I accidentally drank an entire bottle of vinegar.",I thought it was terrible wine.,Once I went out with a guy who wore 3D glasses the entire evening.,"Oh, one time I rode in a sidecar on a guy's motorcycle, and the sidecar detached and went down a flight of stairs.","Another time, I went to a really boring movie with a guy, and while I was asleep, he tried to pull out one of my teeth.",I literally woke up with his hand in my mouth.,"We went out a couple times after that, but then he got weird.","I know it sounds crazy, I'm a grown woman, but I am just not good on first dates.","Oh, okay.",Okay.,"You have a problem, and this is how we're gonna fix it.",I know what you're thinking.,"I wear an earpiece, you sit at a table nearby, you speak into a mic, you tell me what to say on the date.","But let me tell you something, Ann, it never works.","No, no, no.",We are gonna go to a restaurant and have a practice date.,"I will pretend to be Dave, and you will practice on me.",That's a way better idea.,"Hey, Dave, it's me.",It's Leslie.,"Hi, Leslie.",It's good to see you.,Hi!,You don't wanna do that quite yet.,"So, Dave.",Let's begin our conversation.,What's on the note cards?,They're possible topics of conversation.,"""Whales, parades, electricity.",""" And the rest are blank.","Yeah, well, I couldn't think of anything else.",Leslie's in worse shape than I thought.,Is she practicelaughing?,"Oh, Dave You!","The Danish call it ""op og ned apparat,"" which literally translated means the ""up and down machine.",""" Wow, that's a thorough history of the teetertotter.",Now I'm gonna talk about the local flora and fauna found in Pawnee.,Okay.,What's amazing You know what?,Just ask me a question.,Just try to get to know me.,Okay.,I can't think of anything to ask you.,I'm sorry.,My mind is blank.,Just ask me the first thing that comes to your head.,How big is it?,Really?,"Oh, my God.","Hey, Tommy.",Hi.,Hey.,Are you ready?,"Yes, I am.",Just give me one second.,"Hey, Donna.",Let me ask you something.,Do you hate black people?,Excuse me?,"'Cause, apparently, in 1988, you donated money to the presidential campaign for David Duke.",The KKK guy?,I got a phone call.,They said he would lower taxes.,Boom!,How's it feel to lose so hard?,"I'm sorry, honey.",Let's get coffee.,ReeRon!,"You remember my wife, Wendy Haverford.",Of course.,"Yeah, hi.",How are things at the hospital?,"Very good, thank you.",I just got a pediatric surgery fellowship.,Nice.,"We're celebrating, 'cause she's super rich and super hot also.",Okay.,"Come on, Tommy.",Cut it out.,You're super hot.,Everybody else has to deal with it.,Let's get out of here.,"See you later, Ron.",I've established a scientifically perfect 10point scale of human beauty.,Wendy is a 7.,"4, which is way too high for Tom, who is a 3.",8,Ten is tennis legend Steffi Graf.,"Hi, Dave.",You're late.,And I can see your nipples through your dress.,What?,No.,Really?,"In nursing school, we took a psych course on how to treat phobias with a method called ""exposure therapy.",""" So, like, if you were afraid of snakes, they would immerse you in a tank of snakes.","So, I am going to immerse Leslie in a tank of bad date.","You're 20 minutes late, I almost left.",Okay.,God!,"Well, I was dropping my niece off.",What's your niece's name?,Torple.,What?,I don't know.,That's not a name.,I don't have a niece.,My niece's name is Stephanie.,Stop lying.,"Hey, look.",There's bread.,You want some?,"Oh, no!",I got flowers in your soup.,I'm so sorry.,Come on!,Just I have to go to the whiz palace.,"You know, Dave, the place where you You know, the toilet thing.",It's a bathroom!,It's called a bathroom!,"Hey, Mark.",A little birdie told me that you have one unpaid parking ticket.,"Well, that's funny, because a little birdie told me that your adoptive mother was arrested for marijuana possession.","Oh, snap!",What?,"You didn't know that, huh?",I didn't know I was adopted.,"Oh, no.","Oh, Jerry.","Oh, Jerry.",I'm so sorry.,I really didn't wanna play.,You That was not my intention.,It's not your fault.,He totally baited you with that unpaid parking ticket.,"Tom, could you come into my office?",Tomato sauce.,Rontonamo Bay.,Do be seated and congratulate me.,For what?,Winning the game.,"I just found out, through some pretty impressive investigating, that your wedding was a sham.",It's a green card marriage.,That's crazy.,I was born in South Carolina.,"These colors don't run, baby.","Yes, but Wendy was born in Ottawa, Canada.",Her visa was set to expire the day after you got married at the county courthouse in front of three strangers and no family.,Okay.,We met in college.,"She wanted to work in the States, she couldn't get a permit I knew it.",I knew you couldn't get a wife as hot as her.,"Seriously, Ron.","Games aside, you gotta keep this between us.","Don't tell anybody, please.","Now, come on.",Don't worry.,I'm not gonna turn you in.,"Just admit that when it comes to digging up dirt, I bested you in this game.",Say it.,"Say, ""I bested you.",""" Fine.",You bested me.,Is that all?,No.,I'll have your wife tonight.,What?,I'm just kidding.,Get out of here.,"Why would you say that, Dave?","That dog was, like, my best friend.","And when she died, it was one of Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.","Hey, Tiffany.","Yeah, I definitely wanna see you tonight.","No, I can't really talk right now, 'cause I'm on a date with this drip.","Yeah, I can ask.","Hey, do you wanna watch a porno after this with me and my wife?","No, Dave.",'Cause you're disgusting.,"So, it's definitely a no?",I don't understand why you're being so terrible.,We're just two people trying to go on a date.,It's supposed to be fun.,It's just a date.,"You're right, it is.",Well done.,Sorry I had to get all medical on you.,"But now you see that even if everything goes wrong, you'll survive.","Well, well, well.",You coy bastard.,Mark.,Tom.,"You hate Ron, right?",No.,I think Ron is fine.,"So, we're on the same page.",You gotta help me take this guy down.,There's gotta be something on him.,"Tom, I'm starting to feel kind of gross about this game.",It's not about the game anymore.,Ron has some serious dirt on me.,I need to balance things out.,"You must know how that feels, you got tons of dirt in your past.","Please, you gotta help me.",There is a man named Duke Silver.,He hangs out at a bar in Eagleton.,"He's an old friend of Ron's, maybe you should ask him.","Thanks, man.","I'm gonna dig up so much dirt on this guy, there's gonna be worms all over the place.",It sounded snappier in my head.,Yeah.,Ann is so awesome.,I'm lucky to have a friend who would spend a whole day being so mean to me.,Catch.,"I don't need your dress anymore, I'm gonna wear my own stuff.",Mepower.,Good.,You're officially first dateproof.,"Thank you, Dave.","Listen, it is impossible that he's not gonna like you.",He's gonna freak out about how awesome you are.,"No, he's not.","Yes, he is.",He's gonna love you.,You're cool and you're sexy and you're funny and you're smart Yeah.,"Look, any guy would be lucky to date

lucky to have me.","And I think our first date tomorrow is gonna go awesome, offthecharts amazing.",Up top.,"All right, let's do this, bitch!",I'm not scared.,Can I come and sit down for a little bit?,"'Cause I walked here, 'cause The drinking.",I don't know I do know.,I'm coming inside.,"So, move, okay?",You make a better door than a guy.,Hey.,This is gonna sound weird.,I'm looking for a guy named Duke Silver.,"Yeah, he goes on in a second.","Ladies, ladies, ladies, it's just about that time.","It's with the jazziest pleasure that I bring out for you, my man, Mr.",Duke Silver!,"Thank you, Dwayne.","As always, it is a thrill to be here, during this witching hour with you lovely ladies.","Now, relax, and let the Duke Silver Trio take you on a little journey to yourself.",Ann was helping me because I was panicking about tomorrow.,"Well, did I say something to make you worry about No, no.",Just the whole idea of first dates just kind of freak me out.,But not anymore.,I can't even believe that I was scared to go on a date with you.,"I mean, you should be scared of me.",Okay.,I think I need to return this sweater.,I think it fused with my shirt in the dryer or something.,"Okay, I think that's a sweatershirt combo.",I think it's going pretty well with Dave.,He wants me.,I can totally tell that he wants me.,I'm right here.,"You know I'm here, right?",Did you see my bra?,Mmm?,"Bee, boop."," Guess what? I'm wearing the hot one tomorrow, the black one.", Okay., Can I use your bathroom? Yes.," Are you impressed that I know what it's called? Look, maybe I ought to give you a lift home.", Good.," Well, in London, they call elevators ""lifts.",""" So, you're gonna give me an elevator home? No, thank you.", Okay., Let's Let's go., Okay? Okay., Let's go Okay., down to the pub That's right., To the pub., get a pint., Yes., We'll put our knickers in The Beatles records.," Okay, yeah.", That's This is an English accent., What I cannot believe is Dexhart's wife.," I mean, how clueless can you get? How did she not know this was going on? More importantly, how does she stay with him after all this? I think Dexhart's credibility Hey.", Can I help you at 11:48 p.," m? Okay, here's the whole thing.", Here are all my skeletons.," When I was 16, I had sex with a married woman.", Right.," When I was in college, I smoked a decent amount of pot.", Uh-huh., Nothing insane.," When I tell you what What the hell are you doing? What I'm doing is, I'm trying to tell you that I've done some stuff that I'm not very proud of.", But I like you.," So, I would rather you not find out about this from anyone but me.", This was a bad idea.," No, no.", It's fine.," I get what this is, and why you did it."," Is there anything that you would like to share from your past, to sort of balance the scales? Yeah."," One time this guy rang my doorbell at midnight, to brag about getting laid when he was 16, so I shot him.", Good night., It's been a real gift making sonic love to you tonight.," If you want more of the Duke, both my albums are for sale here, Smooth As Silver and Hi Ho, Duke."," And look for my new CD next month, The Memories of Now."," So, come see me, come talk to me, come love with me, and maybe we can walk through fire together.", Thank you., Good night., Duke! Huge fan.," Look, Tom."," I imagine you'll wanna tell everyone about this, but I have worked pretty hard to cultivate a certain authoritative, or intimidating image around the office Can I Can I get a picture? Sure."," Say, ""I bested you!"" I bested you.", All right., Thanks for loving the Duke., Thank you., Thank you., That That was a lovely photo., Truce? Truce., You're kidding me., No., I'm not.," You showed up at the guy's house in the middle of the night, drunk, and you didn't even sleep with him? Should I have? It never hurts.", God., Hey., Hey., Hey! You left quite a bit of stuff at my place last night.," Purse, and earrings, and a shoe.", I am so sorry for what happened last night.," On my list of embarrassing things that I've done in my life, that was numbers one through seven.", I totally understand if you wanna cancel., It's okay., You can make it up to me tonight on our second date.," Second? Well, yeah.", Last night was our first date.," So, that would make tonight our second.", I'm looking forward to it., You like dancing? Yeah! I don't I'm a I don't like dancing., Then we don't have to go., Okay.," Well, we went on our first date, and I didn't even know it.", A.,K.,A.,", I nailed it."," No fires, no ambulances, just good old-fashioned showing up drunk at a guy's house late at night."," However, I wanna be clear, I have no plans to resign.", Is it weird that my feelings are hurt that no one's found any dirt on me yet? Hello! I drove a riding lawn mower through a Nordstrom! There's video that I took! It's on the Internet., Nothing., Jerry., Plastic surgery? I got hit by a fire engine., You are so lucky., How?   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 05,"Today we are welcoming a delegation from the Parks Department of our sister city, Boraqua, Venezuela.",Our photoop with the mayor is tomorrow at 3:00 p.,m.,"So, I'm gonna need your suggestions about my wardrobe ASAP.","I told you, gold sequin sweatpants.","Also, remember, everyone, Venezuela is a poor country.",These men are not used to the wealth and flash that we have here in central Indiana.,Our only job over the next two days is to make these men feel at home.,"Yes, I am a little nervous.",Pawnee has kind of a tricky history with welcoming foreign visitors.,But things have changed.,"Our guests are gonna stay in a motel, for sure.","Oh, God!",What if they don't speak English?,"April, you know Spanish, right?","Oh, good.",Excellent.,My mom's Puerto Rican.,That's why I'm so lively and colorful.,"Oh, my God.",Here they are.,"Okay, everybody, clean up.",Pull your thing up.,"Everyone, just be Good.","Jerry, hit it.",This is my baby.,"I've put this whole trip together, and let me tell you something.","It's not been easy, you know?",How do you fit all of Pawnee in a 48hour visit?,I had to drop the Rock and Roll bowling alley from our itinerary.,That was one of the most difficult phone calls I've ever had to make.,"Hello, most excellent representatives of the great Parks Department of Boraqua, Venezuela.","I am Deputy Director of Parks and Recreation, and Chairwoman of the Departmental AdHoc SubCommittee for Pit Beautification, Leslie Knope.",It's a pleasure to meet you.,"I'm ViceDirector Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departamento de Parques, Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Maldonado.",I'm Tom.,"These are my colleagues, Antonio RiveraFonseca, Minister of Small Fountains.","And Elvis Correja, Administrator of Hedges.",And he is?,Pay no attention to him.,"He is our intern, Jhonny.",He is worthless.,We are quite tired from our trip.,"Could you have your servant collect our bags, please?",What'd he call me?,"Tom, please.","It's a different culture, okay?",Just be a good host.,Do this for me?,Fine.,Yes.,We will get our pathetic servant boy to fetch your luggage.,"Go, boy!","Now, I know you gentlemen had a long flight, but I have prepared a welcome party in your honor.",Excellent.,I like to party.,"Well, my job is to see to your every need.",Do we just select the woman we desire?,I will take the large black one.,Interesting choice.,What?,Do you have some kind of book with photos of the women available to us?,"If not, I will also take the sexy black one.",I am not surprised at all.,I've been to South America.,I did very well there.,I think there might've been a translation problem.,"When I said party, I meant one that did not include sex for pay.","But one that had food and drink and dancing, that sort of thing.","So, no women?",No.,Off to kind of a weird start.,We have so much to learn from each other.,What kind of birds do you guys eat?,Chickens.,"Us, too!",Amazing.,What is this?,"Water, I'm sorry.",Agua.,"In our country, government officials drink only bottled water.",I can assure you that that water's very safe to drink.,No.,"Bottled, please.",Send the boy.,"Tom, go get water.","Leslie, come on!",For your troubles.,"You got it, Chief.","Hey, April, can you help me out a second Go away, Jerry.",Okay.,This is a gold plated replica of the gun Hugo Chavez used in the 1992 Socialist revolution.,It is a gift.,This gun truly symbolizes the blossoming peace between our two nations.,A key aspect to diplomacy is giftgiving.,"The gift has to be nice enough to honor and respect the guest, but not so nice that it shames him.","Plus, it needs to represent the local culture.",And I found the perfect thing.,"A bottle of highfructose corn syrup, made right here in Pawnee's own Sweetums factory.",Sweetums!,"If you can't beat 'em, Sweetums!",Since 1891.,"And eight and a half dozen rubber baby bottle nipples, also made here in Pawnee.","Kernston's Rubber Nipples, tastes like the real thing.",Yes.,And we too are pleased to be here in your dirty alleyway.,"We thank you for the container of sap, and the bag of garbage.","His English isn't perfect, so I don't think he realizes how insulting he's being.","We're also sister cities with Kaesong, North Korea.",Their town is far nicer.,"That's fine, it's my job.",I'm a diplomat.,I'm not supposed to take it personally.,"We haven't been here for a very long time, but what we have seen is, really, from the bottom of our hearts, truly depressing.","Really, really sad stuff.","I mean, that's why people respect Hillary Clinton so much.","'Cause, nobody takes a punch like her.","She's the strongest, smartest punching bag in the world.","It's funny because Antonio said to me, ""Can we turn this car around ""and say we're sick or something, or that we lost our way?",""" Of course, that would be rude to you.",What is your profession?,I'm a city planner.,This city was planned?,"On the drive in, I saw a tattoo parlor, next to a school next to a Taco Bell.",It looks like it was designed by a very stupid rodent.,He's actually a pretty smart rodent.,Uhoh!,Ah!,You have a quick wit.,You know what?,"I've changed my mind, I will have you for the evening.",Oh!,Boy.,She'll get back to you on that.,"Politically, no, I don't support Chavez.",I despise him and everything that he does.,"On the other hand, this is a pretty sweetass gun.","The banana you wanted, senor.",Ah!,Finally.,You peel.,What?,"With your hands, you peel the banana.",Okay!,"Let's get started, shall we?",I have a full day of activities planned.,I would like to see where the children are fed the sweeteners.,A restaurant?,American children are fattened more efficiently than any other children in the world.,"I mean, they're like little basketballs.","I mean, they're huge, little porkers.",Okay.,This is our thermometer!,I'm trying to turn a giant dirt pit into a community park.,"But I need $35,000, and the city doesn't have enough money in its budget.",I do not understand.,You've never had a budget shortage?,No.,Venezuela is blessed with massive oil reserves.,"Massive, I mean, tremendous, like, you would not believe.",Hmm.,"The state sells the oil, and keeps all the money, and we build whatever we want.","Wow, well.","Now, I do not understand.",I feel my English was very clear.,Shall I repeat?,"Venezuela, Venezuela, my country, has a lot of oil.",Oil is food for cars.,The Venezuelans are a very confident people.,"Okay, look, I know these guys didn't turn out to be exactly how we thought they would be.",You said they might not know what toilet paper is.,I'm calling an audible.,We can't be humble anymore.,"What we're gonna do is, we're gonna take them to our best park and we're gonna blow their socks off.","Yeah, I don't think that's gonna blow their socks off.","Fine, we'll go further.",We'll take them to Chicago and pretend it's part of Pawnee.,Or New York.,Or London!,"No, wait, the money's different there.",They'll figure it out.,"Okay, never mind.",We'll go to the park.,Everybody doing okay back there?,Comfortable?,"Well, the motel we're putting you up in is really nice.",You can watch TBS.,Do you have TBS in Venezuela?,I have everything in Venezuela.,I have four satellite dishes on my estate.,"We get 14,000 channels.",Fourteen thousand.,I already know who wins Project Runway.,Wow.,I'm coming over to your house then.,"I see what you're getting at, but no, thank you.",I am still primarily interested in the large black woman.,Here we are!,"Take it in, boys.",This is an embarrassment to America.,I'm sorry?,You are right to want to correct this.,Correct what?,"This is the giant pit of dirt you were telling us about, is it not?",The one you want to turn into a park?,"No, no.",This is already a park.,And it's one of our bestloved parks.,Why are the trees so small?,They're not that small.,"Besides, size doesn't matter.","Yes, it does.",Our trees are huge.,We build tunnels through them.,The parks in Boraqua are far superior.,"The park in my hometown, El parque del Este, we have a monorail, and we have an aquarium, and we have the Jaripa Amphitheater.",It's huge.,Lady Gaga played there last week.,Great.,"Well, we don't have Lady Gaga.",And I don't think she's going to come here unless her career takes a very bad turn.,But we have something more beautiful than Lady Gaga.,Democracy.,I'm gonna show you an example of that.,Let's go to a town hall meeting.,"Elvis, Oh Henry!","Raul, Butterfinger.","Antonio, Nestle Crunch with the crispy rice removed.","Weird choice, but for you, I got it done.",I find it incredibly demeaning.,But guess what?,Cash money.,I'm gonna make it rain I'm just gonna pick that up real quick.,"So, are you guys ready?",We're about to start.,This is where you have your meetings?,"Well, the location rotates.",Sometimes we have them on the volleyball courts.,Where do you hold your meetings?,"Well, now that you ask, we usually rotate as well between different fortresses and citadels, and palaces.",Hmm.,We don't need palaces.,The ideas are what shine in our meetings.,What are you?,Some kind of moron?,Why don't you have hand dryers in the park bathrooms?,They're so much more sanitary than paper towels!,Anyone knows that!,My dog went to one of your parks and ate another dog's feces.,And I'm going to sue you for that.,How do you like it?,No!,How do you like that?,Now imagine you're holding coffee.,This is outrageous.,Where are the armed men who come in to take the protesters away?,Where are they?,This kind of behavior is never tolerated in Boraqua.,"You shout like that, they put you in jail.",Right away.,"No trial, no nothing.",Journalists?,We have a special jail for journalists.,You're stealing?,Right to jail.,You're playing music too loud?,Right to jail.,Right away.,You're driving too fast?,Jail.,Slow?,Jail.,"You're charging too high prices for sweaters, glasses, you right to jail.","You undercook fish, believe it or not, jail.","You overcook chicken, also jail.","Undercook, overcook.",You make an appointment with the dentist and you don't show up?,"Believe it or not, jail, right away.","We have the best patients in the world, because of jail.","Well, it was tough going, but it was lively.",What did you think of the open forum?,This meeting of ugly people yelling?,It is like torture.,That's one perspective.,"In Boraqua, the government moves like a hot knife through butter.","Not as this here, listening to people yelling, these fat faces turning all red?",Are you kidding me?,We're like kings!,We walk down the street and they treat us like rock stars.,We answer to nobody.,"In a true Democracy, we believe that the input of our citizens is extremely valuable.",Hey!,These pretzels suck!,Thank you.,See?,No wonder nothing ever gets done in this country.,Really?,Nothing gets done?,Tell that to the Golden Gate Bridge.,Or American Idol.,Or the moon!,"Oh, wait, you can't, 'cause you've never been there.","Look, this is not personal.",We just think that you are weak and your city is disgusting.,I think you're rude.,And I think you've been rude since you came here.,"And I think that your medals are stupid and your uniform is lame, and you guys want to marry Hugo Chavez!",Hey!,Do not disrespect Chavez.,Stupid Chavez.,I just told you not to disrespect him.,"Good, I just did.",That's twice.,I don't like Chavez.,"Yes, you do.",And do not disrespect him.,"No, I don't!","Yes, you do!","No, I don't, Raul.","Look, if you don't like it here, then go, okay, Raul?",Great.,Good.,Shut up.,"We're shutting up, yeah.",And we'll go.,Those are our pens.,Right.,We don't even need them.,"Great, then don't take them.",We didn't.,They started it.,"Look, those guys were rude, arrogant, narrowminded, classA jerks.","Now, I may have lost my cool, but they deserved it.",Okay.,I'll call the mayor and cancel the photoop.,No!,Don't do that!,Okay.,Then call the Venezuelans and apologize.,"No, they were rude, arrogant, narrowminded, classA jerks!",Okay.,Then I'll call the mayor and cancel the photoop.,No!,Do you see the problem here?,Yes!,But I don't want to!,Yesterday I was tough and direct and today I have to be charming.,Basically Thank you!,"Yesterday I was Hillary Clinton, and today I'm Bill.",Can I get anyone anything to drink before we start?,Coffee?,Brandy?,I'd love some coffee.,"Anything, guys?",No.,Some nuts?,I'll have some nuts.,Gummi Bears?,Sure.,Apple crisps?,Yeah.,Granola bars?,I'll take those.,Nothing?,Sure?, Okay., I'll be right out there if you need me.," Well, Raul, gentlemen, thank you for coming."," Well, I would just like to first say, I am so sorry for blowing up yesterday.", It was completely uncalled for.," Well, we are sorry as well.", We were very tired from our long journey.," Also, we were a bit jealous.", Our colleagues from Caracas are visiting their sister city of Miami., Yeah., They've been partying with Dwyane Wade., They sent us all these photos and QuickTime files.," I mean, you have to see this place Miami."," Just gorgeous, everything."," There's so much soul and life everywhere! Every little tiny street, so much culture, and history! And the cars! People really take care of their cars there."," You notice that and they're a little older, Clean and shiny but still just beautiful."," Really, really nice.", Yeah.," And the food, so spicy and wonderful.", We could not even believe it., But Pawnee is really good as well., Yes.," In any case, I made a few phone calls, and the government of Venezuela has authorized a special gift for you."," $35,000? Yes, it is to fill your pit to start to build a park."," No, no, we can't take this."," Yes, yes, yes.", Please., We will see you later today at the photo-opportunity., And I think we're good here., No? Okay.," Okay, gracias.", Good meeting., I don't know., Maybe I should return the money.," It's from a foreign government, I don't really trust these guys.", I'm gonna return the money., Are you crazy? You could buy a low-end Lexus with that money.," Or, you could build a park with that money.", Let's look at the pros and cons.," Pro, we could fill in the pit and build a park."," Con, we might be filling it in with dirty money."," Pro, $35,000 worth of dirty money."," Con, not quite sure why that's a pro."," Pro, we can fill in the pit."," Con, Ann already said that."," Pro and con never works! Pro, yes it does.", Fine., Fine., We'll keep the money.," Okay? Everybody happy? Jerry, are you happy? What did I do? Meeting adjourned, Jerry! Can I just say, I still feel kind of weird about this money.", Okay.," Look, I know they've given you a hard time."," When the mayor gets here, we'll do the photo-op, they'll be out of our hair, you'll get to build your park.", Ah! Leslie! Hello., Raul., The mayor will be with us in just a few minutes.," If you don't mind, we would like to take a video of you to show our superiors."," Okay, sure."," Do you have the check that we gave to you? Ah, yes, I do."," Okay, you're gonna show it to the camera and say how much it is and what it is for."," Okay, this is a check for $35,000 and it is to build a park."," How generous! Yes, it's really generous."," Now say ""Viva Venezuela!"" Viva Venezuela! Viva Chavez! Thank you, Venezuela! ""Viva Chavez!"" Say it! Aw, come on."," I don't want to ""viva"" that guy."," We just gave you $35,000."," That's worth one ""viva.",""" Viva Chavez.", Yes! Viva Chavez! Yeah., What is he saying? They are very happy., They say Hugo Chavez will love this video because it is another success for their committee., Committee? Yeah., They're a Committee to Humiliate and Shame America., It will be a good video., The Committee to Humiliate and Shame America? Yes., It is Hugo Chavez's passion project., And we just had an idea.," Why don't you call the park after Chavez? You know, you call it Hugo Chavez Park."," And you can have a nice, big fountain of his head, so that when the water is coming out he is spitting at you all the time.", You should write this down., Viva America! Viva Pawnee! Viva Mayor Walter Gunderson! You have offended us., You have offended the government of Boraqua., You are no longer our sister.," No, America is not perfect.", But diplomacy isn't just sucking up and being a pushover., Sometimes you got to get tough.," I am gonna build that park myself, and it is gonna be awesome.", And it's not gonna have a fountain shaped like Hugo Chavez's head spitting water all over everyone., Unless that's what the people want.," And that, sir, is democracy."," Leslie, come see this! Check out this video April sent me."," Hey, guys.", I'm at Jhonny's place in Venezuela.," It's okay, I guess.", He has like five million rooms., And this is only his guesthouse., Holy cow! There's a lot of guys with guns here.," It's better than my mom's house, I guess."," So, tell Leslie I don't know when I'm gonna be back."," Oh, and Donna's here."," Hey, guys! Ola!   ","

friends?,Yeah.,All right!,Awesome!,It is playground time!,"Well, we're here in Eagleton.",It's two towns over.,"And we're all volunteering for Kaboom, a service organization that says it builds a playground in a day.",High five!,High five!,High five!,I never trust anything that comes that quickly.,That's why I don't eat Minute Rice.,"So this whole ""build a playground in a day"" thing, I mean, that's just a slogan, right?",Nope.,"One day, 24 hours.","Keef, that is so incredible.","I mean, I work in Parks, and I know how hard it is to get something done.",Not if you have the Kaboom spirit.,"You can look at a problem, and you can either go, ""Oh, this is a problem"" or you can kaboom, blow it up and turn it into something great.",You literally kaboom the problem.,"Come on, people!",I see more ground than playground!,Kaboom.,Don't do that.,"One, two, three.","Man, this is tough.","Yeah, but just think of all the kids that'll swing on this swing, fat kids,

kabooming, he kabooms for a day.",But you teach a man how to kaboom.,"Kaboom, kaboom, kaboom.","Oh, I'm so pumped.",Feel I could take on the world.,"I could prep, like, a thousand diagnostic tests.",In an hour.,That's the spirit.,"There it is, the pit.",Hmm.,There's something I wish I could kaboom.,"Well, we are.",It's just a slowboom.,"A slower, more deliberate kaboom.",Yeah.,Totally.,See you tomorrow.,Okay.,You know what this mess is?,This is a list of things we have to complete before we fill in the pit behind Ann's house.,You know what this is?,This is a kaboomer.,"Jerry, did you use permanent marker again?","I'm sorry, guys, I I just grabbed the wrong This is a big I grabbed the wrong This isn't gonna Open very big, Jerry.",Okay.,Forget it.,Let's all pretend Jerry wasn't born.,And this is clean.,How do we speed up the process?,How do we kaboom it?,"Rules, codes, permits, red tape.",I never realized how frustrating it is to be in the government.,"In my next life, I'm going into private industry.",Maybe strip mining.,"Okay, everybody take out their thinking caps and rip them up.","Then take out your doing caps, 'cause we're gonna do something today.",I have a couple of doing caps in my wallet.,That's what I call condoms.,"Come on, Tom.","Focus, please.",How do we cut through the red tape and how do we get this pit filled in?,Ideas?,We need to cut through the red tape and get the pit filled in.,"Yes, Tom.",Good.,"Okay, everybody else needs to participate.","Come on, guys.",These suggestions aren't gonna suggest themselves.,"Yes, Jerry.",This idea better be good.,Ann?,I support you.,Good.,You could petition to expedite the Architecture Review Board process.,"Mark, buddy, you're not listening to me.",I want to kaboom it.,Okay?,Can I talk to you outside really quick?,Sure.,"Mark's gonna help me, so thanks for nothing, Jerry.","Good job, Ann.",So you really wanna get this pit filled in?,Yes.,And you'll do whatever it takes?,"Mark, I am so sick of moving like a slug.",I want to move like a cheetah.,Or a slug driving a remote controlled car.,"Something more plausible than that, but fast.",Would you break the rules?,I won't murder.,That's good to know.,But it's actually very simple.,"If you wanna fill in the pit, just go fill it in.","Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.","Oh, I like that.","Okay, wow.",So who gives me the goahead to not ask for permission but ask for forgiveness?,Is it Ron?,"No, no.",No.,It's nobody.,"It's nobody, it's you.",You have to be bold.,Okay.,"Okay, look.",You wanna get the pit filled in?,Go rent a bulldozer and fill in the freaking pit.,Hey.,What's up?,"Say you had a friend who wanted to do something good, but a little risky, and she was kind of nervous about it, and this friend is me.",What should I do?,Mmm.,"You should do it, and you should ask your friend to help you, because your friend totally has your back.",And that friend is me.,You'll help me?,"Of course, I'll do anything I can to help.",Let's do it.,Okay.,What are we doing?,Is it dangerous?,We're not gonna murder anyone.,It was crazy.,I didn't get a single permit.,Nobody stamped anything.,"All I did was order a backhoe, and it came with a guy who runs it.",I've never rented a guy before.,I wish I knew about that during prom.,"There was a girl at my prom who was known as ""the back ho.",""" Mary Dunbar.",She'd let anyone massage her back.,I'm so excited we're doing this.,And we're doing it without permission.,We're giving ourselves permission.,"Look, I had these hard hats made.",Check it out.,"Kick, Ass.",I'll take that one.,Okay.,"Oh, my God, Ann, this is so cool.",Do you feel giddy?,Yeah.,I'm so proud of us.,"Miss Montague, you ready?","I didn't wanna tell him my real name, you know?",Yeah.,"First, speech.",Is important moment here.,"We are about to fill this hole now, not with dirt, but with the courage of a thousand lions and the solemn memory of all of our friends who have fallen in this cursed hole.",Dump it!,Ugh!,What the.,Andy?,I'm okay.,"Oh, God.","Oh, my God.",Oh!,"Well, that beeping was sure annoying.",But this is even more annoying.,I'll handle this.,"The monitor is not a toy, Andy.",Anything is a toy if you play with it.,I'll chalk that up to your concussion.,The good news is your CAT scan's clear.,Cool.,"Andy, I'm really happy you're okay.","Leslie was worried, too.",We should've checked before to see if you were home.,"Oh, no, I told you.",I moved out of the pit.,I just had to go back because I forgot my headphones.,"Then I laid down on this really comfy tarp, I saw an old cereal box I hadn't read before, so I must have drifted off.",Next thing you know Dirt.,Scooch up for one sec.,And back down.,There you go.,Ah!,That is perfect.,It's like I'm lying in a cloud.,This is awesome.,"Ann and Andy, just like old times.",The pit works in mysterious ways.,"I'm sorry about Andy, but I'm not sorry about what I did.",What's my crime?,I got bold?,And a little negligent?,Knope!,My office!,Now!,Hey.,Can I smoke in here?,You don't smoke.,Just asking if I can.,Are you high?,I'm high on kaboom.,"Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness.",That's right.,"You never did ask me for permission, did you?","Well, I'm sorry to burst your kbubble, but I just had my ass khanded to me by the City Manager.",And now this entire department is kscrewed.,"Ron, I'm so, so, so sorry.",What the K were you thinking?,I would prefer that she ask me for my permission so I can say no.,I like saying no.,It lowers their enthusiasm.,Hello.,"So, I brought you some clean clothes that I found at my house.","Oh, my God.",My sexy sweater.,It has a hole cut out over the bicep.,Thank you.,No problem.,"No, ACakes, seriously, thank you.",You're welcome.,No.,Thank you.,"No, no, no, no, no.",What What are you What do you think is happening right now?,"A tragic accident reignited feelings you thought were long dead, and we are finally back together.","Andy, we're not back together.",You know that I'm kind of with Mark now.,"Oh, God.",Is that still happening?,I don't get it.,What does he have that I don't have?,Are you serious?,Yeah.,Everything.,"He has, literally, everything you don't have.","A job, a car, a steady income, an address, a second pair of shoes, table manners, the ability to say ""tampon"" without giggling.",Mark has his life together.,I'll get you a different nurse.,It's awful what happened to Andy.,"But sometimes when you make an omelet, you got to break a few eggs.",What's the alternative?,No omelets at all?,Who wants to live in that kind of world?,Maybe birds.,Then all their babies would live.,Miss Knope?,Miss Knope.,Hi.,"Scott Braddock, City Attorney.","Hey, Scott.",I didn't know that you were friends with Andy.,I never met him.,What I do know is that he could sue us at the drop of a hat.,"I mean, right now, he's the most dangerous man in Pawnee.",Is that all you lawyers think about?,"Lawsuits, and laws and legalese?",Yes.,Yeah.,"Well, you can relax.","All I'm gonna do is go in and just say, ""We are so sorry, it's entirely our fault"" No, no, no, no.",You can't say any of that.,It admits liability.,"You can't say ""I'm sorry,"" or ""I apologize.",""" It implies guilt.",That's insane.,I have to apologize.,"Andy was a victim Can't say ""victim.","""  of an extremely unfortunate situation.","Can't say ""unfortunate,"" and you can't say ""situation.",""" I can't say the word ""situation""?",No.,It implies there was a situation.,Can I give him the pig?,"Yeah, the pig's fine.","Hi, Andy.","Hi, Leslie.",I got this for you.,Hope you squeal better.,Aw!,This is my friend Scott.,"Hi, Scott.",Mmmhmm.,"Andy, I just wanted to say, I am so, so Mmmmmm, mmmmmm, mmm.","Filled with emotions, as any person would.",What?,No miming.,Uh You were in the pit.,We're not conceding that point.,You were in a place.,We're both here now.,"The government No, no.",No.,We got to go.,What?,Let's go.,Why?,Wendell Adams.,I'm Andrew's attorney.,"Andy, no.",It's my only option.,"Andy, stop.",I've advised my client not to speak with you.,He's suing the City of Pawnee.,"Andy, you're suing your hometown?","Andy, no.","Look, can we just talk about this?","Leslie, no.",This is terrible.,"Don't say ""terrible.",""" Don't look back.",Hello?,"Andy, it's Leslie.",Hello?,Hello?,"Andy, it's Leslie.",Psych.,Leave a message after the beep.,"Andy, it's Leslie.",Look.,What did you mean when you said it's your only option?,I think we should talk.,Without lawyers present.,"If you wanna meet, just put a white chalk ""X"" on the mailbox across the street from City Hall.",Or call me back.,Just call me back.,"Andy, why aren't you returning my calls?",Is it because of your lawyer?,It's because of your lawyer.,"Hey, Andy, it's your aunt, your mom or dad's sister.",I don't know how to tell you this but your uncle has passed.,He's with Jesus now.,So we're having a memorial in 30 minutes at City Hall.,Hey!,Free guitars at City Hall!,Everybody run!,"Because of a local disaster, you, Andy Dwyer, must go to the evacuation center at Pawnee City Hall.",Hmm.,That was weird.,How long have you been there?,I promise that Andy isn't suing just for the money.,"Leslie, the man lived in a pit.",Okay?,"He couldn't find a place to live on the Earth's surface, so he went under the ground.",You're dealing with a grown man who thinks like a gopher.,"I feel like if I could get past the lawyers and find out what's really going on, I think I could get him to drop the lawsuit.","Ann, is that you?",Hey., We need to talk somewhere private.," Oh! Baby, I'm back."," Thank you so Why are you naked? Oh! Well, because of what you said.", We're getting back together.," No, we're not."," Yes, we are.", You should've heard the super sexy stuff she was saying to me.," I said, ""Hey, Andy.", It's Ann.," Can we talk at my house?"" That's not how you said it."," You were like, ""Hey, Andy.", It's Ann.," Can you talk at my house?"" Oh, my God, you are such a baby.", Ugh! Literally.," Big, naked baby.", Put clothes on., You know what? I should have seen this coming.," Has he showed up naked before? Oh, yeah."," Anniversaries, birthdays, holidays.", Good luck.," Where are you Hey, Ann.", Just None of your clothes fit me., So I'm putting an apron over the front stuff.," Is she gone? What did you mean when you said this was your only option? Well, I'm completely broke, and my lawyer said it could be worth upwards of $100,000.", I just can't believe that you're suing just for the money.," I want Ann back, and she said she really needs a guy with a lot of money.", That doesn't sound like Ann.," Well, I can't really do her voice, but she said she likes Mark because he's a grown-up with a bank account.", I put two and two together.," $100,000, I could probably get a bank account."," Sometimes, I think the right thing to do is to not take shortcuts."," I mean, look, I tried to fill in the pit, that didn't work either.", Fine., I'll get a job., Ann will respect that., I can make six bucks a day playing guitar on the street., I can't make six bucks a day., Wait a second.," I know I just said that maybe shortcuts are bad, but I kind of just thought of an awesome shortcut.", Mr.," Dwyer, we're very happy that you're dropping the suit."," Yeah, it's really terrific.", I have my conditions., No., Never., I will not negotiate with greedy street people.," Wait, Leslie.", Let's hear him out., We planned this., Kaboom., All right.," What's it gonna take? One, I want that pit filled in, sir."," Is there a two? A guaranteed starting spot in the Indianapolis Colts, inside linebacker."," Well, we can't accomplish that."," I think that Andy seems like he doesn't care so much about the second one, and he would be fine with us just filling in the pit."," What do you say, Scott? Yeah."," I mean, eventually, we're gonna fill in the pit."," ""Eventually""? I've already been injured in that thing twice."," And I could fall in 10 more times by ""eventually.",""" Every time I walk past that pit, I'm forced to relive the most traumatic two separate days of my life, and wanna sue you again."," Well, I hate to say it, but it really seems like Andy has us over a barrel here, Scott.", Yeah., This is really happening., I just can't believe it.," Oh, sorry."," Usually, in these situations, a person says ""pinch me.",""" Is that Andy? Ah, yeah."," Just one of his conditions for the settlement, I guess.", He settled? Yup.," Gave up $100,000 probably just for one thing, the city fill in the pit behind your house."," Why? Who knows? Who knows why that gopher does what he does? You always hated this pit! Goodbye, pit."," Hello, lot.", How does taking risks make me feel? Amazing., Tingling sensation throughout my whole body., I feel flushed.," My muscles are relaxed, yet I feel awake.", Just waves of pleasure., I wish there was something physical that could make me feel this way.," Wow, you did it.", Are you thinking what I'm thinking? There's so much more to do.," Oh, my God, we're so close.", Yeah.," I'm gonna call Kaboom, and check on their availability for next year.", Great., Information.," Hi, yes, I'd like the number for Kaboom, the national playground building charity.", I hope they can work us in.," Sorry, there's no listing for that name."," What? Are you sure? ""Kaboom"" is a word I made up.", It's not in any dictionary., I trick people into building playgrounds on empty lots in their neighborhoods., It's an elaborate prank.," For my next prank, I'm going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.", They'll never see it coming.,   ,"

know it's Greg Pikitis, but I've never been able to prove it.","He's like an invisible, adolescent, James Bond super villain criminal mastermind.","Or maybe someone else is doing it, but I really feel like it's this kid.","I've got the entire Parks Department watching you, my boyfriend's a cop, so don't even try it.",I don't know what you're talking about.,"Oh, I think you do.","It ends

killer.,"In a way, that's a compliment.",Shows dedication.,Mmm.,"What's the big deal, anyway?","I mean, a kid TPs some statue.",And all the trees and all the benches.,"It takes us, like, 10 days to clean his mess up.","But more importantly, Greg Pikitis sucks, and I wanna destroy him.",Okay.,"Well, if you destroy him early, please come by.",I will.,Hey!,How is someone gonna be able

Swanson.,Is that who this is based on?,No.,It's based on William Percy.,Were you listening to what I just said?,Yes.,"Okay, Andy.",Good news.,You're officially on the Parks Department payroll.,$8 an hour.,Commit this to memory.,"You see him, you stop him.",Knock his head off if you have to.,Don't do that.,Don't do that.,But I give you permission to use excessive force.,Don't use excessive force.,Don't go overboard.,Just stop him.,By any means necessary.,No.,No.,Just stop him.,You know what I mean?,A week ago I had nothing.,"Now, I have a parttime job.",I'm gonna make $32 tonight.,I owe Leslie everything I have.,"Which, after tonight, will be $39.","Hello, Ann.",Hey!,Am I early?,"Nope, you are right on time.",I like your costume.,"Oh, thanks.",Raggedy Ann.,It was one of my favorite books when I was a kid.,Hmm.,I'm a pirate.,Right.,Oh.,"Hey, Dr.",Harris.,How are you?,Ann.,Thanks.,"Um, this is Ron Swanson, from the Parks Department.",I know him from that thing that I'm doing.,This is Dr.,Harris.,You're a doctor.,Yup.,I meant your costume.,I got it.,"Worlds colliding, always awkward.",with friends in parking lot.,"He looks obnoxious and irritating, even from a great distance.","Uh, confirmed.","Normally, I hate working on Halloween, but it's nice hanging out with Leslie.","You know, she's focused, she's committed And she made out with me in my cop car, which is pretty neat.",I shouldn't have said that.,That's clear to me now.,"Hey, guys.",Hey.,"Remember my boyfriend Derek, and his boyfriend Ben?","Yeah, hi.",It's totally okay that you didn't wear a costume.,I did.,I'm a straight person.,"Hey, sorry I'm late.",See?,Sorry it's a little bit lame right now.,But we'll get it going.,I passed up a gay Halloween party to be here.,Do you know how much fun gay Halloween parties are?,"Last year, I saw three Jonas Brothers make out with three Robert Pattinsons.",It was amazing.,"So, you're the Mark that Ann is dating.",I suppose that I am.,We're very protective of Ann.,We look out for her.,"So, you kind of dropped the ball with Andy then, didn't you?",Aw!,Andy.,I loved Andy.,"Ah, such a sweetheart.",Is Andy coming tonight?,You should get back with Andy.,Who needs a drink?,I do.,"Suspect laughing with friends and playing with his stupid skateboard in a snide, turdish manner.",Turdish?,Yes.,Like a turd.,Like a little turd.,"Hey, listen, your scare tactics clearly worked.",You got Andy guarding the statue.,Why don't we go to Ann's party?,Lt'll be fun.,Oh.,Uh We wanted to cover that block anyway.,"Wanted a police presence on it, so, this is within the Confines of Sure, let's go.",Yeah?,Okay.,Yeah.,We'll go by my office and pick up my costume.,Got it.,Can't we just fire a warning shot over his head as we drive by?,"No, babe.",Don't touch that.,Leaving location.,Look at stupid suspect.,I hate suspect.,Where are my keys?,Looks like it's open.,Really?,Yeah.,Pikitis!,We've been tailing that kid for a couple of hours.,"I mean, it must have been somebody else.",It was Pikitis.,Believe me now?,That doesn't mean anything to me.,This is a peach pit.,Okay.,He was eating a peach when I went to go talk to him.,Mmmhmm?,This is his ace of spades.,This is his calling card.,This is what he leaves all his victims.,And it's still warm.,"Okay, go and arrest him.",And send this to the lab.,We don't have a lab.,"Hi, April.","Okay, you're underage.",You're not.,Hey.,"Yeah, I'm gonna leave.",Oh.,Okay.,This isn't that fun.,Didn't need to tell me that.,I'm gonna take this home.,"Nobody was drinking it, so I'm gonna take it.",Okay.,"Gonna take this, too.",Been meaning to read it.,"Okay, this isn't strictly legal.","We can talk to him for maybe an hour, and then I gotta let him go.",You talk to him first.,You have a scary face.,Hey.,"No, in a good way.",Scary cute.,Yeah?,Go talk to him.,Okay.,"I didn't do this, man.",I promise.,"Now, son, I'm a police officer.",Okay?,You shouldn't lie to me.,I'm not.,I've never been here before.,And why would I do this?,Because you've had runins with Miss Knope in the past.,Just a second.,Yeah?,LESLIE: Ask him about the peach pit.,"This isn't oneway glass, you know.",I can see you.,"You know, I like Knope.","I screw with her 'cause she gets all riled up, and her face gets all scrunched up like this.",But I like her.,She's all right.,You see?,What?,"I spent the whole day decorating this place, and everybody's in the kitchen.",Why is everyone always in the kitchen?,I think it's going fine.,It's so quiet.,"Oh, my God.","Oh, my God.","Oh, my God.",This is a total failure.,This party is a failure.,"Oh, my God.","No, no.","It's not a failure, Ann.",Come on.,"Ann, do you have any Mounds?",Because all I can find are Almond Joys.,And almonds give me the squirts.,"Hey, I'm here.",Statue's fine.,"""Crappy Hallowieners.",""" That's hilarious.",Where's the kid?,In the conference room.,Trying to hide his obvious guilt.,"Leslie, I don't know what to tell you.",I don't think he did it.,"Yeah, he did.",And we need a confession.,Okay.,Andy and I are going to take a walk.,"And it's gonna be just you, Pikitis, and these pliers.","Look, I'm not gonna torture this kid.",Nobody said torture.,"Why don't you let me take a run at him, boss?","In order to think like one of these guys, you have to think like them.",Yeah.,He's never seen you before.,So imply that you're someone very important and that you can make his life hell.,Greg Pikitis?,Would you like some boiling hot coffee in your face?,My name is Bert Macklin.,I'm with the FBI.,Ooh.,Are these the same kind of chips?,Ann!,"What's up, gorgeous!",Perfect.,"Get your Raggedy ass over here, girl.","Hey, Tom.",Mad Hatter?,"T Pain, baby!","She poppin', she rollin', she rollin' She climbin' that pole and I'm in love with a stripper This is not a stripper.","It's my wife, Wendy.",You remember her?,Hi.,Thank you so much for inviting us.,"Yes, hi.",Sure.,"She's a surgeon at County General, and she's super hot.","Well, thank you for being a doctor and not coming dressed as a doctor.","Oh, my God.",Who'd be boring enough to do that?,"Ann, what happened here?",Did you tell everyone they're gonna have to get a bone marrow transplant tomorrow?,They look miserable.,This party's a disaster.,"No, it's not.","Yes, it is.",Don't worry about it.,We can fix this.,Totally.,Give us a second.,Looks like Andy's wearing him down.,Shut up!,I'm gonna go finish him off.,That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.,Why don't you just shut up for a second?,What's going on in here?,He's a jerk.,He's being such a jerk.,That's an awful thing to say to a human being!,Are you crying?,"No, I am not crying, okay?",I'm allergic to jerks!,Okay.,"Andy, out.","Fine, and I don't even care!",It's stupid Okay.,The gloves are coming off.,What's that?,I think you know what that is.,"When I came to visit you at the school, you were eating a peach.","Then my office gets vandalized, and somebody leaves a peach pit on my desk?","I don't think that's a coincidence, Greg.","Wow, you nailed me.","I mean, there's no way that two different people could have eaten the same fruit in the same day, in the same area of Indiana.",Never mind that I was actually eating a plum when you saw me earlier.,I know you did this.,I don't care what you say.,I don't care that you were in the parking lot all night.,"Somehow you found a way to get in here Wait, wait, wait.",How did you know that I was in the parking lot all night?,"Because I followed you, genius!",If you followed me all night then you know that it wasn't me.,"Knope, what is your problem?","Look, I have been very civil.",But I will waterboard you.,"No, no.",I don't think she would make a good cop.,"I would be frightened to live in a town that she's the cop of, frankly.",What are you doing?,"Ann, do you want me to liven things up or not?",Course I do.,"All right, then relax.",And turn off all the lights that don't have colored bulbs.,"All right, y'all!",Take the pigs in the blanket and put them to sleep!,It's time to get wild!,"Get this furniture out of here, y'all, we're making a dance floor.","Come on, y'all.",Put the turkey wraps down.,We're about to get wild.,"Ron Swanson's in the building, y'all!",His mom's gonna be here soon.,"Please, Dave, just arrest him.",On what charge?,Just handcuff him to something.,Greggy?,Greg!,Gregsy!,Mom!,Mrs.,Pikitis?,"Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, this is Officer Sanderson.","Bert Macklin, FBI.",What the hell do you think you're doing?,You can't just hold a 16yearold kid against his will.,"Well, we were trying to question him about this vandalism.",Do you have any evidence?,Yes.,No.,No.,We don't.,"Two words, peach pit.",Peach pit?,"His DNA is all over it, I assume.",We don't know that.,We can get it tested.,We can't.,"And if it matches your DNA, then you're going away for a long time.",It won't.,Is this a joke?,No.,I'm calling your shift commander.,"Monday morning, I am calling your boss.",I don't know who to call about you The President of the United States of America.,Fine.,"And if any of you ever come near my son again, I swear to God I will sue you and everyone in this building.","Come on, honey.",Let them think they've lost us.,Then we're Where are you going?,I gotta go tell my boss why I illegally detained a teenager.,I shouldn't have gotten involved with this.,It's just It's just bad police work.,"Yeah, it was bad FBI work, too.",My bad.,"Tonight, the ""T"" in TPain stands for Tom Haverford!",Nurses versus doctors.,"On my mark, three, two, one.",Go!,Vodka!,Go!,Son.,That is one hell of a costume.,Thanks.,"Damn, that's good.",Nice party.,Thanks.,Why would anyone do this?,Kids are kids.,Everybody does stupid stuff like this in high school.,I didn't.,"Yeah, but you were probably a nerd, though, huh?",Hey.,"Leslie, I mean that in a good way.",Look at you now.,You're the coolest person I've ever met.,I even met John Cougar Mellencamp once.,"Andy, why don't you go home?",I'll finish cleaning this up.,No way.,"I mean, you got me a job and you're helping me turn my life around.",I go home when you go home.,"Uh, it's city planning.",It's mostly like regulating things and just making sure people obey the city code.,You wanna get out of here?,Go back to my place?,What?,No.,I'm dating Ann.,Good.,That was a test., You passed.," Let's celebrate you passing the test, over a drink, at my place.", No., Still no., You passed the second test., But we're still watching you.," So, you wanna get out of here, go back to my place? Hey.", Ron.," Hello, Wendy."," Well, you and Tom really turned the party around.", We have a good time together., Tom told me that you know about our green card marriage., And I just want to say thank you for not telling anyone., No worries., I'd hate for you to have to go back to Canada., All that socialized medicine up there., Wendylicious., Where have you been? I was just thanking Ron.," For, you know, not telling anyone."," Oh, yeah.", Thank you., That was cool of you.," You know, you won't have to keep it a secret much longer, because in a few months we can split up without raising any eyebrows.", And we'll invite you to the divorce party.," Huh, maybe Greg is innocent."," If that's the case, then there's another kid out there who's tormenting me.", Maybe., I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty in this country., That's the cornerstone of democracy., Sure.," On the other hand, Greg Pikitis is a little punk.", And I kind of wanna TP his house., Let's do it.," Wait, wait! Wait, wait! This is fun! This is fun! What do I do? You just grab the toilet paper, unroll it a little bit like this, and throw it on the tree."," This is for Mayor Percy! This is for the Parks Department office! This is for pooping on the handball court! Yeah! This is really fun! But I don't condone it! Bye, guys.", Bye.," You're the man, Swanson.", Thanks for coming., Ann! Dude., Thank you so much., I don't even know what to say., Don't mention it.," Also, Tom, your wife is super cool."," So, well done."," Yeah, she's pretty great, right? Yeah."," I don't know how you landed that chick, but she's awesome.", Nice work., You're lucky.," Hi, you ready to go? Yes.", All right., Thank you so much., We had so much fun.," Bye, thank you.", About to head home and have crazy sex., That's cool.," I don't Yeah! Five-O! Five-O! I see you in there, Andy."," Leslie? What are you doing? Oh, boy."," That's them, Officer! Right there! Oh, my God."," Oh, no."," I'm so sorry, I think we have the wrong house."," Why are you doing this? It's really hard to explain, but we were trying to get revenge on this kid, Greg Pikitis, and we thought this was his house, but I guess we got the address wrong.", I'm Greg's mom., You are? Yes., Oh.," Did he hire a fake mom again, to get him out of trouble? What? Whenever he gets in trouble, he goes on Craigslist and hires a woman to play his mother and bail him out."," Oh, that little SOB! Greg! Gregory! I knew it! Oh, my God.", Dude., That kid is amazing., He's not in his room., I don't know where he is., I do.," Make sure you I need more, man.", Hey! Yeah! Let them go! Yeah! Stay on the leader! Cut it! I am gonna wring your neck! How did you get into the Parks Department? I have to know., Maybe the FBI can figure it out.," I'm not even in the FBI, stupid."," Wow, you're amazing.", Hey! You're going to jail for a very long time.," You can't He's not gonna go to jail, you know.", He's a minor.," Well, we'll let the jury decide.", There's not gonna be a jury Then the judge will decide where he goes., Look.," He's going to do probation, he's a minor."," Dave, just let me have this.", Wow.," Nice work, Knope.", Yeah., That is amazing., Thanks.," But the thing that's driving me nuts is, how did he do it? If you destroy him early, please come by.", I will.," How is someone gonna be able to get through that door? Oh! What the Are you I mean, we were here all afternoon."," How did he get in? First of all, we always lock the doors when we leave.", And Dave and I tailed Pikitis from the moment he left his house at 7:00 p.,m., to the moment we came back here.," Does he have a lookalike or something? Did he have an accomplice? I mean, did he have help? How did that little turd do it?   ","

sad that Old Gus is leaving, but it allows me to help Andy restart his life as Pioneer Hall's new shoeshine guy.","Well, I've been listening to your boring speeches for the last 50 years, and now it's time for you to listen to one of mine.","You know, a day like this makes a man reflect upon his life, and I've come to the conclusion that I've completely wasted mine.","And just for the record, I never ever liked being called ""Old Gus.",""" I didn't understand it when I was in my 20s, and I sure hate it now.","So go to hell, every single one of you.","Screw Pawnee, and screw your damn shoes.","Oh, God.",That's classic.,"So, I propose that we change our name from the Subcommittee for Pit Beautification to the Subcommittee for Lot Beautification.","April, stop that.",Who are you texting?,You.,Aw.,She's texting me.,I'm sorry you're bored.,"Uh, hey, everyone.","Oh, hey, Ann.","Leslie, can I talk to you for a minute?",Fine.,"Tom, you're in charge.",Keep the momentum going.,Keep these minds working.,"Absolutely, chief.",Okay.,"Would you rather be able to fly, or speak fluent French?","Donna, go.",French.,"I don't wanna freak you out, but another department filed a planning claim for Lot 48.",Who?,No.,Yeah.,Damn it.,The library?,"Pawnee's library department is the most diabolical, ruthless bunch of bureaucrats I've ever seen.","They're like a biker gang, but instead of shotguns and crystal meth, they use political savvy and shushing.",It's gonna be okay.,It's not a done deal.,"Yeah, you're right.",Thanks for pulling me out of there.,"I need a good plan, though.","You know, I don't wanna cause a panic.","Newsflash, we're screwed.",We got a big problem with the library.,Punkass book jockeys.,Wait.,Why do we hate the library?,The library is the worst group of people ever assembled in history.,"They're mean, conniving, rude, and extremely well read, which makes them very dangerous.",And they're trying to steal Lot 48 for a new branch.,What?,Get out of here.,Yeah.,Yeah.,On 48?,I actually think a library would be nice that close to my house.,Let's bring the library down.,Yeah.,But I'm not about to say that in there.,A new branch?,Jerks.,You're kidding.,"Oh, I hate them.",Okay.,We need to make contact with someone there.,Does anybody know anybody that works at the library?,"Well, we actually kind of do.",The new Deputy Director of the department is Tammy Swanson.,Ron's exwife?,That's terrific.,Or is that awful?,"I mean, he hates her, but he knows her.",Everything's okay.,Or is it just the same?,"Leslie, you're thinking out loud again.",Am I?,I am.,Of course.,That bitch of an exwife is working for the library now.,That is perfect.,The worst person in the world working at the worst place in the world.,I have to go talk to her.,And you got to give me something I can use.,Does she have any weaknesses?,No.,"What do you mean, no?",Everybody has a weakness.,Not machines.,I honestly believe that she was programmed by someone from the future to come back and destroy all happiness.,I see.,"I knew that you had two exwives named Tammy, so I was hoping that there was one that you got along with and Nope.",I hate them both.,"On my deathbed, my final wish is to have my exwives rushed to my side, so I can use my dying breath to tell them both to go to hell one last time.",Would I get married again?,"Oh, absolutely.","If you don't believe in love, what's the point of living?",I'm just looking forward to a thoughtful debate with Tammy about the relative merits of parks versus libraries.,"And in case something bad goes down, I wore my sharpest rings.",This one will tear you up.,Hello?,Hi.,I'm Leslie Knope.,I called a little while ago.,You have a lot of nerve showing your face here.,Excuse me?,"You have overdue book fees totaling $3, missy.",That is so typical.,"I should have known you'd use a low blow, dirty pool BS move like that.",No That's why everybody hates the library.,Here.,You know what?,Here's your $3.,"Leslie, no And I'll see you in hell.","Leslie, Leslie, Leslie.",I'm just kidding.,"My gosh, I mean, you did have $3 worth of fines, but I cleared them.","We government gals have to watch each other's backs, right?",I know this is a trap.,But I don't know how.,Okay.,Did you talk to Ron?,Ron tends to exaggerate when it comes to me.,I swear I don't have cloven feet.,Please.,Sit down.,"Shine, shine, shine your shoes.","What do you say, sir?",Ma'am?,Shoeshine?,I won't look up your skirt.,Ann.,Whoa.,"Oh, my gosh.",Crazy.,What are you doing?,It's me.,It's Andy.,"Hi, Andy.","So, Ann, how you been?",Good.,"Yeah, Leslie told me you were working here now.","Yeah, I just joined the rat race.",Chasing the cheese.,"Racing the rats, trying to get the cheese.",Enough technical business talk.,You look ravishing.,"Not a lot of customers, huh?","Yeah, business is a little slow.",It is definitely due to the economy.,I've been hearing a lot of people say that a lot about a lot of stuff.,"Whoa, Mark.",You want those shoes shined?,I'll give you a discount because you're a friend of Ann's.,"Well, I'm more than a friend of Ann's.",Not for long.,Sorry?,I don't know.,At least he finally has a real job.,"When we were dating, the only job he had was sending audition tapes to Survivor and Deal or No Deal.","Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer, and I would be a perfect contestant for Deal or No Deal.","I want it to be a perfect park with a stateoftheart swing set, and basketball courts, and off to the side, a lovely sitting area for kids with asthma to watch other kids play.",Wow.,"If I'd had a park like that when I was growing up, I probably wouldn't have gone through such a prolonged mallslut phase.","Well, that's the goal, Tammy.","Listen, you guys got there first.","I'm gonna withdraw my request for the lot, as a professional courtesy to you.","Government gals, right?",Government gals.,So you talked to Tammy?,What's it like to stare into the eye of Satan's butthole?,"She's changed, Ron.",She's a different person.,I think it would be healthy for you to get a sense of closure.,Look at Mark and me.,We slept together.,"We talked about it, we're still friends.",You slept with Brendanawicz?,No.,"Look, Tammy and I don't work.",We are oil and water.,"Or oil, and TNT, and C4, and a detonator, and a butane torch.",Nothing good will come Wait.,"She's here, isn't she?","Hi, Ron.",Tammy.,Good.,Good start.,"I'm sorry about this, but I just really wanna talk to you.",Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?,Let's get this over with.,"Thanks, Ron.",It means a lot.,You're a miracle worker.,Oh.,Do you know what you just did?,"Yes, Donna.",I got two people to put aside years of hostility and open a door to the possibility of friendship.,You were not here when Ron and Tammy got divorced.,I was.,Those two are crazy.,Yeah.,And you just opened the gates to Crazytown.,"Frankly, I think Ron was acting like a baby, a little bit.","I mean, what is he afraid of?",Tammy's just a woman.,A nice woman.,"You know, she's not a murderer.",She's not a dragon.,"It's really good to see you, Ron.",You've aged horribly.,You son of a bitch.,That didn't take long.,"Oh, my God.",What is your problem?,"Nothing's changed, has it?","Who set the bed on fire, huh?","Excuse me, folks.",I did.,Okay?,Is that what you wanna hear?,"Please, folks.",We're fine.,We're fine.,Okay.,I'm so sorry.,Please.,Fine.,Take it easy.,"Oh, my God.","When you meddle in someone's personal life, it's just so rewarding.","Oh, God, yes.","Oh, God.","Oh, wow.",Yeah.,Sir.,Ma'am.,"Oh, God.","Oh, yes.",Baby.,Gun it.,The usual place.,"Have Gun Will Travel reads the card of a man A knight without armor in a savage land Good morning, Jerry.",That is a beautiful sweater vest.,April.,You look like you could use $20.,Am I right?,Why?,"'Cause you're a kid, and kids always need money.",I need money.,Ha!,"That's why you're my favorite, Tom.","When Tiger Woods feels invincible, he wears a red shirt and black pants.","Good morning, Deputy.",Ron wears the same thing after he's had sex.,I'm a simple man.,"I like pretty, darkhaired women and breakfast food.",But this stock photo I bought at a framing store isn't real.,"Today, I got the real thing.",A naked Tammy made me breakfast this morning.,I should have taken a picture of it.,"Hey, Tom.",What's up?,My girlfriend's ex is working and he's been pretty clear about wanting her back.,What do I do with that?,Mmm.,That's a tough one.,"You should break up with her, and tell her to go out with me.",That's good.,Can I ask you another question?,Why did I come to you for advice?,Okay.,"I think you should play this one cool, man.",Be the grownup.,Take the high road.,Yeah.,Ann's a classy chick.,"If you get down in the mud, you're just gonna lose her respect.","You've just made a surprising amount of sense, Tom.",Thank you.,I've never taken the high road.,But I tell other people to.,'Cause then there's more room for me on the low road.,"So, how did your coffee with Tammy go?","Leslie, I can't thank you enough for sticking your nose where it didn't belong.",I knew it.,So what did you guys talk about?,Old times?,"Oh, I love talking about old times.","New times are great, too, but there's just something about old times, you know what I mean?",We didn't talk.,We made love.,"Oh, my.",Mmm.,Good.,"Well, spare me the details.",I'm just happy.,"It was so intense, I didn't know where my flesh stopped and hers began.",You know what I mean?,Yeah.,"Our marriage was always a complete disaster, but we did have that.",The two of us.,"It's like doing peyote and sneezing, slowly, for six hours.","This seems like a private matter, but I'm so That woman really knows her way around a penis.",Okay.,"Well, I'm happy that it went well and that you enjoyed your coffee.",I truly believe that everyone should be friends with their exes.,I can't even tell you how many of my exes' weddings I've been to.,They're reading their old divorce papers.,"""Three fistfuls of hair.",""" That's not even possible.","Well, I'm too classy to say ""I told you so,"" Donna.",So I wrote it on a Postit.,Leslie.,Why don't you take the rest of the day off?,"I mean, you spend so much time worrying about this park, but really, who cares?",I care.,I care a lot.,"It's kind of my thing, remember?","But at the end of the day, what does it matter if the lot becomes a park, or a museum, or a megachurch?",Or a library.,"Nobody said ""library.",""" Ron, have you been talking to Tammy about the lot?",No.,I swear on a grave.,"Oh, my God.","Ron, tell me the truth.",Are you giving her the lot?,Not giving.,We have discussed a trade.,For what?,More Excuse me?,More sex.,Ugh!,"Tammy, can I speak with you for a second?",I know what you're doing.,You don't care about Ron.,You're just using him to get Lot 48 for your library.,"Leslie, that's crazy.",And correct.,Why are you doing this?,"Les, there are two kinds of women in this world.",There are women who work hard and stress out about doing the right thing.,And then there are women who are cool.,You could either be a Cleopatra or you could be an Eleanor Roosevelt.,I'd rather be Cleopatra.,What kind of lunatic would wanna be Cleopatra over Eleanor Roosevelt?,Haven't you ever messed with a man's head just to see what you could get him to do for you?,We do it all the time in the Library Department.,You should come join us sometime.,I would never work at the Library Department.,"I'm gonna tell Ron what you just said, and this little game that you're playing is gonna be over.",Okeydoke.,"Yeah, you better run.",We're no longer government gals.,"Look, we need to talk.","Ron, no.",The Planning Department Reprioritization Document?,"Calm down, I haven't signed it yet.","Yeah, well, you're going to.","Because Tammy wants you to, and you do everything that she wants.",She made some really good points about libraries.,Are you even listening to yourself?,You're defending the library now?,"Ron, the library?","Of all the horrifying, miserable things in the world?",Some people like libraries.,I can't even believe what I'm hearing.,"""Some people like libraries.",""" Ron, she's in your head.","You said that she was a manipulative monster, and you were right.",No.,No.,Tammy's changed.,Look me in the eye and tell me that she's changed.,Look me in the eye.,"I'm so screwed, Knope.",Her hooks are in my brain.,Yep.,She has all the power and I have nothing.,I'm so little.,Why don't you just break up with her?,I don't think I can.,"We would just end up naked, and I'd give her your lot, and my house, and God knows what else.",I have no control over my actions.,It's like she's crawled up inside of me.,"Oh, God, Ron, I don't wanna hear about your disgusting sex anymore.",Okay?,Now sack up.,You are Ron freaking Swanson.,"Not around her, I'm not.","It took years of intense, focused hatred to get over her, and now I've undone all that great work.",You've got to help me break up with her.,I don't think I should get involved in this.,"Oh, now you don't wanna get involved?","""It's just coffee, Ron.",""" ""She's changed, Ron.",""" ""I let Mark nail me and we're still friends.",""" Okay.",I would never use those words.,I never said Point taken.,Let's go dump your ex.,Thank you.,"So, would you like to be in the room when I tell her it's over, or would you rather wait outside?",In the room.,I don't want her to think I'm a wimp.,Here're the ground rules.,Don't talk to her.,Do not make eye contact with her.,Don't believe anything she says.,"Just sit there, like a potted plant.",Can you do that?,Come on.,Do you have any tong Mark.,Hey.,Hey.,Donna.,"So, how's the shoeshine game?","I'm on a break, one of the many advantages of owning your own business.","You know that's not your situation, right?",Yeah.,"Listen, Donna.",Yes.,Quick question.,Ann is trying to decide between Mark and myself.,"No, she's not, actually.","If you had to choose, who would you choose?","Right now, on the spot.",I'm not sure.,Why don't you spin around for me?,You know what?,Can we talk privately?,Sure.,Just out here.,Mmm.,Andy.,"So, Tammy, for that and many other reasons, Ron has decided to end this relationship.",Wait a minute.,Ron brought you here to break up with me for him?,She volunteered.,"Leslie, Ron doesn't wanna break up with me."," What Ron wants to do is leave here right now, go to the sleaziest motel in town, and wrap himself around me like a coiled snake."," No, he doesn't.", I'm pretty sure he does., See? He's completely over you.," Look, I understand that this Ann situation is awkward.", But I like you a lot as a dude.," And I just hope that there is some way that we can both be mature, and maybe be friends.", Yeah., I doubt it.," I mean, I think you're a cool dude, too.", I like you as well., But I'm still in love with Ann., I couldn't have been more upfront about that.," Is punching allowed on the high road? I'm sorry, Leslie.", She wins., I can't resist her.," God, Ron, you have to.", Stay out of this., This is our relationship., He's my man., And we have something twisted and beautiful., Oh., You want Ron., That's what this is all about., No., That's insane.," Fine, I had one dream."," But no, no."," Baby, don't you see what's happening here? She's manipulating you because she's jealous of me, and the things I get to do to your body and face."," I'm here because Ron is my friend, and I don't like seeing my friends miserable."," And you, Tammy, you make him miserable."," So, Ron, you can give her the lot, or don't, whatever."," Just, please, find a way to be happy.", Knope., Wait.," Ron, it's okay.", Just sign the thing.," No, Leslie, it's not okay.", You just put my needs in front of your own., No woman has ever done that for me before., I'm sure that's not true.," You see the kind of women that I choose, right? Look, just wait for me downstairs."," If I'm not down in five minutes, it's only because I'm receiving a pleasure so intense Oh, my God."," What the hell are you doing? ""Andy and Ann's Family Shoeshine""? Andy, Ann, I thought it had a nice ring to it."," Oh, my God."," Look, Mark has been really cool about all this, and you're throwing it in his face."," Look, I still have feelings for you.", Okay? I said it., What do you want me to do? Not mention those feelings to your boyfriend? Yes., Yes., And you might wanna take these pictures down.," Oh, my God.", Take those pictures down., What? Fine., All of them., I'm gonna., Now.," Oh, my God.", Give me the bikini one., The teeny one? Bikini one., You didn't give her the lot., Let's get out of here., Is part of your mustache missing? Yes., Just keep walking., There's a pushpin in your face., Leave it in., Can't you walk faster? My legs are shorter than yours., Mmm., We had a good run., Thank you for saving my future park., I know that must've been hard for you.," You didn't kill Tammy, did you? I'm afraid she can't be killed.", To exes., May they always stay that way., Tammy is a mean person.," Come on, Ron.", You can do better than that., She's a grade-A bitch., There we go.," Every time she laughs, an angel dies.", Even telemarketers avoid her., Her birth was payback for the sins of man., But you know the worst thing about her? She works for the library., She works for the library.,   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 09,Okay.,"As everybody knows, The Spirit of Pawnee was defaced again last night.",What was it this time?,Chocolate pudding.,Huh.,That's new.,The mural that normally resides here is called The Spirit of Pawnee.,And it's very controversial.,"We've had someone throw acid at it, tomato sauce.",Someone tried to stab it once.,We really need better security here.,"We also need better, lessoffensive history.","So, the city council has decided that The Spirit of Pawnee should be changed to something just a little less horrifying.","Now, since the murals were made by government employees back in the 1930s, we thought it might be fun if each department submitted a design for a new mural.",And you'll submit your concepts tomorrow afternoon.,"All righty, folks?",Thank you very much.,"Hey, Leslie.",What's your design going to be?,A tree?,"Joe, you work in Sewage.",Your department literally specializes in crap.,You really want to do this?,I told you before.,"""Crap"" is a slang term.",And I don't like that term.,"But at least we don't specialize in losing, like you guys.",Sewage.,Let's roll.,Damn!,How does Sewage always get the hottest interns?,"Guys, this department has the chance to design something that could be in this building forever.",This could be our legacy.,"I thought building a park on Lot Well, you can have two legacies.",Look at Madonna.,"Great singer, amazing arms.",Look at O.,J.,Simpson.,"Heisman Trophy winner, Naked Gun.",Mmmhmm.,"No offense, Leslie, but I'm not an artist.","Oh, that's not true, Donna.",I've seen your fingernails.,"Um, I pay someone to do this.",Really?,"Oh, well, shoot.","Anyway, I'm ordering all of you to design a mural.","Uh, only Ron can order the whole department to do something.",Ron?,Order them to do this.,Do whatever Leslie says.,Okay.,"So, here are your supplies.",I want you to go and find the spirit of Pawnee.,And make me a sketch.,And it needs to be breathtaking and moving and historical and better than every department.,And you have one hour.,Designers.,Make it work.,Tim Gunn.,"You, my friend, are ready to go dancing.","Thank you, sir.",All right.,Next?,Andrew.,Looking good.,Business is booming.,Yeah.,Hey.,"Ron, how about you?",Need a little dog waxing?,"It's only 5 bucks, and I'll let you cut in front of this guy.",What?,Come on.,Beat it.,This is Ron Swanson we're talking about.,I'm impressed with Andy.,Pulling himself up by his bootstraps.,He reminds me of me.,I got my first job when I was nine.,Worked at a sheet metal factory.,"In two weeks, I was running the floor.",Child labor laws are ruining this country.,Do you have a key in your shoe?,No.,"No, I have a bunion that's practically its own toe.","Normally, the pain howls through my loafers like a banshee on the moors.","But for these past three minutes, it's been reduced to a faint growl.",Okay.,That's neat.,"Well, hey.",We are all finished.,"Well, that was great.","Thank you, son.",No sweat.,Next?,You shouldn't let your friends cut in line.,It's not good business.,You want to know what else isn't good business?,That guy's my friend.,Right.,I'm saying you shouldn't let your friends cut in line.,All right.,"Sorry, pal.",Here.,Give me this.,Next.,"So, what are you looking for exactly?","I don't know, man.","""The spirit of Pawnee.",""" That's all I got.",Here.,Just give me $20 worth of art.,"Just something that seems personal, that only I could have done.",Tell me about yourself.,No.,Just paint.,I have no interest in art.,Let me clarify.,I have no interest in nonnude images.,"Dude, what the hell kind of art is this?",It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles.,I'm an abstract expressionist.,"No, you're a con artist.",And I'm a guy that's out 20 bucks.,Ugh.,Whatever.,I'm a terrible artist.,"But the Parks Department has done so much for me that if I can help them out in any way, I will.","Oh, God.",Maybe I should just give them all free flu shots.,I know everything about this town and these murals.,And that's why this is a dream come true.,Literally.,I have had a dream where I designed a mural.,"But then it turned into a nightmare, because the mural started talking, and it came alive and it was whispering.","And I couldn't hear what it was saying, so I leaned in close, and then it ate me.","At one point, Gina Gershon was there.",My piece is truly going to capture the spirit of Pawnee.,"I never understood the term ""elbow grease.",""" I guess it's not really grease.",Just hard work.,"Oh, hey, Ron.","Nice, shiny shoes you got there.","Oh, hey.","I was just I think Oh, no.",Shoot.,"Actually, it looks like I scuffed this one.","Do you need your money back, Ron?",Because I already spent it.,Really?,How did Never mind.,I think I'll just take another full polish.,Can I cut in line again?,I feel right at home as a shoe shiner.,"I have no idea what I'm doing, but I know I'm doing it really, really well.",Okay!,Let's get going with the spirit of Pawnee.,"Ann, you go first.",Okay.,Um Okay.,"Well, since it's the Parks Department, I thought I would design a pretty park.",With dogs playing.,"And I can't really draw, so I just cut some stuff out of a magazine.",That looks like something a death row convict would make in art therapy.,"Dude, I tried.",And you failed.,It's dogs and people playing in a park.,It's cute.,"It's okay, sweetheart.","You can't make art, because you are art.",You're beautiful.,But that sucks.,Okay.,Let's see yours.,Fine.,Mine is amazing.,It's going to blow your mind.,Okay.,This is some professionalass art right here.,I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at.,"It's abstract, Leslie.","Over here, you've got some shapes.","And then you come over to this side You know, it's actually kind of interesting.",Each shape is its own thing.,"But then when it comes together, it really gives you a sense of completion.",Hmm.,A piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction.,Is that normal?,"So, it's the Last Supper, but with famous people from Indiana.",Mmmhmm.,"John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, uh, David Letterman, Vivica A.",Fox.,"Okay, so, here's where it gets a little dicey.",Because there's not that many celebrities from Indiana.,"So, a NASCAR.","Uh, my friend, Becky.",Ron Swanson.,Donna?,Who's the Jesus?,That would be Greg Kinnear.,I didn't know he was from Indiana.,"Yeah, you know, I read that he was.",Oh.,Do you think he's the best choice for Jesus?,"I mean, he was great on ER.",Greg Kinnear wasn't in ER.,"Yeah, he was.",I don't think that he was.,Who am I thinking of?,Okay.,Next?,Wow.,"Really good, Jerry.","For my murinal, I was inspired by the death of my grandma.","You said ""murinal.",""" She No, I didn't.","Yes, you did.","You said ""murinal.",""" I heard it.","Anyway, she Jerry.",Why don't you put that murinal in the men's room so people can murinate all over it?,Jerry.,Go to the doctor.,You might have a murinary tract infection.,I just wanted to show you my art.,Murinal!,Murinal!,Murinal!,Disqualified!,It's pointillism.,And each dot is a photo of a citizen of the town.,No one cares.,At all.,Okay.,"So, this is a multimedia project.","First, a bunch of rats made out of garbage.",And this is a TV screen.,"It'll be like a big, flatscreen TV, and it will play looped video of knee surgeries.",And then this is a humansized hamster wheel that will be next to the mural if we can get one.,"And it will be spinning and there will be, like, a fat guy in it all the time, like, screaming and, like, eating raw beef and, like, bleeding.","And, like, blood will, like, come out of his mouth and stuff.","And that'll be, like, right next to the mural.",I have one question.,Why?,"If you have to ask, you don't get it.",I don't think they really got the assignment.,"If we're gonna beat all the other departments, we have to choose something that will stand the test of time.",Like the Mona Lisa.,Or the music of Squeeze.,"June 8, 1922.",The Pawnee Bread Factory burned to the ground.,We lost a lot of good bread that day.,As well as several human lives.,And it also made the whole town smell like toast.,"Which one resident described as ""disturbingly enticing.",""" But I digress.",The point is we rebuilt Pawnee to the wonderful town that it is today.,Why would you want a mural that shows people dying when you could have shapes that come alive?,"Well, because it's the most famous event in our town's history.",And people love voting for tragedy.,Look at the Oscars.,This is our Holocaust movie.,This is our English Patient.,It sounds like you're exploiting the tragedy.,"See, Ann gets it.",Okay.,"Time to vote, everybody.",Cast your votes.,"May the best, most tragic project win.","When we started this, we were six different voices with six ideas for a mural.",And then those six voices came together as a team.,There are no losers today.,"But there is one winner, us.",The Parks Department.,"Tom, the results of the vote, please.",Onetoonetoone toonetoonetoone.,"We all voted for ourselves, didn't we?",Yeah.,Okay.,Third time today.,Mmm.,That's a good shoeshine.,What the man?,I I don't know what happened.,Frankly.,I emitted a noise.,The noise was involuntary.,"Sometimes, a sound is just a sound.",You know?,We need to whittle these down.,Can we all agree on eliminating any of these designs?,Ann's blows.,Wow.,Don't hold back.,"No offense, but it's a giant picture of a park.",That's not art.,"Well, at least it's not a fat human hamster eating meat.",You don't even work here.,"Okay, guys, you both have a point.","Ann, yours was a little trite.","And April, yours was hellish and might make someone vomit.",Thank you.,"Look, there's something about those shapes.",There's some emotional art right there.,Any kid could do that.,No kid could do that.,Only God could do that.,What is so great about the shapes?,"He likes the shapes, okay?",And he's part of the team.,"So, here.",Take these scissors and cut out your favorite shapes.,And then we'll put them on a new team mural.,We're going to make a new design that takes the best parts of all of our designs.,It's like if you got Michelangelo and Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis from Garfield to do one painting.,Imagine how good that painting would be.,I think it's really good.,I'll be right back.,Brendanawicz!,We need you for something.,Can it wait?,I am so swamped here.,Ann's in trouble.,We think it might be pills.,What?,No.,That's a lie.,But this is just as important.,We need you to look at a piece of art.,"Oh, God.",What is that?,This is our entry for the mural contest.,"We couldn't decide on one design, so we took parts that we all liked of our designs, and then we just kind of smushed it into a thing.","Well, you made a camel.",You've never heard that saying?,The camel was actually a horse designed by a committee.,And what you guys have here is one ugly camel.,Featuring Bill Paxton.,Greg Kinnear.,Right.,Greg Kinnear.,Oh!,Is Bill Paxton from Indiana?,You have to save us.,You have to design something.,"Leslie, I'm not an artist.","Yes, you are.",I've seen you sketch things.,"Uh, yeah, like poles for stop signs.",That everybody stops and looks at.,"By law, Leslie.",They're required to.,"Look, Mark.",Please.,You're the only one of us who's actually got any talent.,I know you'll do something good.,"And I really, really want to win this.",Please?,What are you going to do tonight?,I was going to go to Arby's and watch Frontline.,Okay.,Here we go.,Okay.,"So, it is an old man feeding pigeons in a park.",Uh The spirit of Pawnee?,Maybe?,You got to be kidding me.,How is that better than my park scene?,It isn't.,And that's saying something.,And who's the man?,Is he famous?,Is it Martin Landau?,"Look, I have no dog in this fight.",I'm just saying that this will win.,It's nothing.,It's mush.,"There's not even one shape in there, Mark.",Where are the shapes?,I'm not saying that this is any good.,I'm saying that this will win.,It's mass appeal.,"It's like what motels put up, and it hangs there for years, and no one ever throws acid at it.",Mmm.,Who did this?,I like it.,Seriously?,I mean Sorry.,Yeah.,It comforts me.,That'll win.,This is garbage.,We've got to go back to the shapes.,No.,This is boring.,We got to go back to the garbage.,I would take the shapes over this.,"I mean, come on.",I wouldn't take the shapes over anything.,I'd take Jerry's murinal over this.,"No, guys.",This is the one.,What?,Sorry.,Mark's right.,This is an outrage.,Mark's not even in the department.,Right.,Neither is Ann.,But Ann's hot.,And that counts for something.,"Whatever happened to, ""We're the Parks Department!",Rahrahrah!,"""Down with the Sewage Department!",""" Yeah, we spent all day here for no reason.",We have a reason.,We're going to win.,That's our reason.,Our designs are not going to win.,Mark's might win.,"How great would it be if we won, you guys?","You'll feel a lot better, I promise you, after you win.",We're going with this one.,All right.,I'll see you at the presentation tomorrow.,"That is an order, team.",Go team!,Team dismissed.,"Yes, we are a team.",But I am the team leader.,"So, I made a bold decision.",We're playing it safe.,"Hey, Knope.",How's life in the Parks Defartment?,Better than life in the Sewage Defartment.,Which makes more sense.,Whatever.,You guys are screwed.,Get used to this.,Because it's going to be hanging on the wall right outside your door for the next 100 years.,That was pretty good.,You think they're going to win?,No.,No.,They went super patriotic.,It's a classic mistake.,"It seems crowdpleasing, but it's still a stance.","And in government, there's always someone who will oppose a stance.",Us?,Old man feeding pigeons?,No stance.,Absolutely no point of view whatsoever.,No point of view.,Smart.,No.,I haven't been back.,I wish him good luck in his business.,"And yes, I will absolutely go back to get my shoes shined soon.","I don't, frankly, see why this is a topic for discussion.","Oh, hey, Ron.",What's up?,"Uh Andy, you know, the thing the other day?","Other day, other day Yeah.","Oh, yesterday?","I am That That was I feel I'm okay You know, I'd be okay if we I'd be okay if we never mentioned it again.",Never mention what again?,"The moan, Ron.",The weird moan you made., That was super weird., Do you not remember that? I talked about it with the lady who went after you for a half an hour., She said she thought it was an animal Okay., It was just an odd moment., Let's just Let's just not talk about it anymore., That's what I was trying to say.," But, yeah.", Okay., Okay., Good time., Ms., Knope., Chief Konner.," What do you got there? Well, we aren't really artists.", But we gave it a shot.," It's your basic dogs playing poker, but with an everything's-on-fire theme.", This is my nephew over here., Hmm., And this is an attractive lady with a hamburger for a head.," Just some stuff we liked, you know? Anyway, we had a lot of fun putting it together."," Well, good luck.", Thanks., We think it's a winner., Go ahead., What? Camel's way more fun., I want my team back.," And my team made this hot, crazy camel mess."," So, this is what we're going to submit.", Even if it means we lose.," God, I hope we win.", But we're definitely going to lose., Probably., All right., Let's get in there and show them how Parks gets it done., Yeah., And Ann., How Ann gets it done.," Yes! Let's go! What are the shapes? The shapes are awesome, is what they are.", You can't handle it.," No, I actually like them.", Forgive me., Is that Michael Jackson? Yes., The pride of Indiana., That's right.," So, it's relevant.", Who is he carrying? Jesus Greg Kinnear.," You know, it looks like he's carrying Kinnear into the burning building."," Oh, well, that's because he's moonwalking."," So, he should be going the other way.", That did not occur to me., Sorry.," So, there you go.", The Spirit of Pawnee., We didn't win., But neither did anyone else., They realized it was going to cost a ton of money to hire a muralist.," So, they're just going to restore the old one.", They're changing the title to The Diversity Express.," Oh, well.", No., No., It's not as good as the other one.," I don't know what you mean by ""good.",""" Neither do I! Just do another one."," You know, I have actual assignments that I have to finish for art school? Shut up and do more art for me.", This one's racist., It's beautiful., I've looked at this for five hours now., I like the green one., And the red circle right here.," I'm tearing up, man.",   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 10,"And I'm like, ""What?",""" It's pretty great having Andy working in the building.",The guy is so much fun.,His new thing?,Piggyback rides!,Anytime you

rezoning of Lot 48?,I have been busy.,I know.,But I think it would be a really great thing for the neighborhood.,I don't doubt it.,But it's really a question of resource allocation.,And I completely understand that.,"But you and I both know that if we wanna find the money, we can.",I'm running late.,"Oh, I'll walk with you.","See, the thing is, when we allocate money for parks Just a reminder.",Tomorrow's a halfday.,"Jerry, Mark and I have to conduct the annual trail survey at Slippery Elm Park.","Ron, I had the trail survey hats made to commemorate the trip.","Nice, Jerry.","Oh, and if you have any questions about the details, feel free to shoot me an email.",The only trails he's gonna be surveying are trails of lies and deception.,Ron has a special deal with the park rangers.,"Every November, they let him use their cabin so he can go on a secret hunting trip with all the guys in the office.",Not all the guys.,He's never taken me.,"Fine, all the men.","Ron, let's cut the bull.","I want me, Tom and all the other ladies included on your hunting trip.",Hunting trip?,"We're doing a trail survey, Leslie.",You're literally listening to turkey calls.,Is this not rap?,Come on.,All right.,"Look, it's not just a hunting trip, it's a tradition.",I am really good at hunting and I'm even better at being one of the guys.,"Well, it's a work event, so legally I can't stop you from coming.",Yes!,This is gonna be so fun!,I'll bring S'mores.,And just like that the one tiny aspect of government I enjoyed was clubbed to death before my eyes.,April!,I need you to do something for me.,"I'm going hunting tomorrow, so call the State Parks Office and get verbal confirmation that our budget documentation is in.",Can I just tell you the or do you want me to write it down?,I'll write it down.,Can you handle this?,You want me to dial a number and then read another number out loud?,Yes.,Can you handle this?,No.,"Well, try, okay?","And if you do it, I will name the first turkey I shoot after you.",Cool.,Ann!,Ready to bag some birds?,Nope.,But I am ready to relax by the fire and get my Real Simple magazine on.,"Well, if you change your mind, you're now officially a licensed Indiana hunter.","Oh, gross.","Hello, you have reached the Indiana State Parks Department.",Your call is very important to

little upset.,I feel a little queasy.,"Yeah, that might be the chew.",You could spit it out.,I swallowed it.,"You're supposed to swallow it, right?",No.,All right.,Poor little buddy.,Why they call it chew and not swallow.,"Am I right, Ron?","Yes, you are right.","All right, safety basics!","Donna, can you tell me why it's bad to look down the barrel of your gun?",Is that a trick question?,"No, Donna, don't!",Please!,"Rule number one, do not point the weapon at a person.","That includes your own face, Donna.","Now, every year, before we go on our first hunt, we do a toast.","So, grab a beer.",To the hunt.,"Here, here.","Here, here.",And to the hunters!,The only way to defeat the beast is to find the beast within.,Pretty good.,"Here, here!","Here, here!",DONNA: Yeah!,Right on!,Cheers.,"Ron, your toast sucked.","The traditional toast is ""To the hunt!",""" And it is said by me.","You all set, Mark?","Oh, I was thinking maybe we could do mixed doubles, you know?","Boygirl, boygirl.","Leslie, you said that we were gonna hunt together.","Oh, Ann, I always forget because you're so pretty, you're not used to rejection.",I have to hunt with Ron.,"Ann, we'll go together.",Perfect!,"All right, I hope you're ready to discuss some college bowl game scenarios!",Bully.,Andy!,Andy!,"Can you come here, please?",Yeah.,What's up?,"I've been on hold for, like, an hour and I really have to pee.","Can you just sit here for two seconds and just listen, please?",Yes.,Please?,Okay.,"And if they answer, can you just read those numbers out loud?",Yeah.,"Okay, thanks.",Now here's the female adolescent turkey.,Could you hear the difference?,No.,Turkeys can.,"Boola, boola, boola!","Boola, boola, boola!","Boola, boola, boola!",We do that the first time one of us hits something.,"Oh, cool!","Boola, boola No, no.",You missed it.,"Look, Ron, I know this weekend, you were looking forward to a lot of manonmanonman action, but I just wanted to say I'm very grateful that you let me come along on this trip.",That's fine.,I'm just glad you didn't end up inviting more of the motor What the hell?,Give me some warning!,I saw a quail.,"Sorry, man, you snooze, you lose.","Boola, boola, boola!","Boola, boola, boola!",I think this is gonna be a really good bonding sesh for me and Ron.,Guys love it when you can show them you're better than they are at something they love.,"Hey, check this out.","I am on hold with the State Parks Department I am on hold, so suck on my butt Nice.",Yeah.,"They didn't answer, obviously.",Where is everyone?,Hunting trip.,Hunting trip?,Did Mark go?,Yeah.,"That's cool, at least he's not with Ann.","No, Ann's there.",God!,How come he gets to do all the things I wanna do?,"Go hunting, Ann.",Maybe a deer will eat him.,That would be really awesome.,"But I don't think that will happen, probably.",You're surprised that my breasts didn't throw my aim off?,"Leslie, please.",I don't care that you're a girl.,I just don't like change.,"I like going to the same place with the same people, telling the same stories and seeing who can bag the most turkeys.",It seems like you like to go hunting with the same people 'cause you know you can beat them.,A hundred bucks says I bag more birds than you.,You're on.,Let's split up.,I do it better alone.,"Yeah, you do!",See?,Just one of the guys.,Your favorite kind of cake can't be birthday cake.,That's like saying your favorite kind of cereal is breakfast cereal.,"Mmm, I love breakfast cereal.",Look!,Some kind of bird!,Let's kill it!,"You talking to me, bitch?",What were you aiming at?,Nothing.,Okay.,Okay.,Okay.,I can understand why people like that.,Right?,Yeah!,Yeah!,Yeah.,And keeping one's eyes open is always a good rule of thumb around guns.,This is such a great day.,"See, at my house, I got a wife and three beautiful daughters.","But this trip, it is the one time of year I get to pee standing up.",I love that sound.,I've been shot!,I've been shot!,Somebody shot me in the head!,"Boola, boola, boola.","Oh, my God!","Oh, my God!","Oh, my God!",I gotta pee.,Over here.,"All right, right there.","Ron, I got your hat!","Ron, I have your hat!","Oh, my God!",Are you in a lot of pain?,I was shot in the head with a shotgun.,"Ron, it's actually not that serious.","I just need you to stay calm, okay?","Yeah, I'm just gonna stay angry.",I find that relaxes me.,"Okay, Ron, we called 911 and they're gonna send a ranger.","Oh, damn!",This is a mess.,The rangers won't let us come back next year.,No!,We're not gonna think about that right now.,"You guys, can you just put him on the day bed in the carcass room?",Day bed?,Yeah.,Sure.,"Okay, now.",Hold on!,Hold on!,Is that Donna?,Donna?,"Okay, easy.",Donna?,Don't worry.,Are you okay?,What?,Is it your heart?,Are you having trouble breathing?,It's my car.,Someone shot my car!,Okay.,"Here's your Scotch, Ron.","Okay, Jerry.",Jerry's here.,Here you go.,"Here's your Scotch, Ron.","There we go, Ron.",Okay.,"Hey, you know what is great?",Ann's gonna take care of you.,And Ann is the best nurse in North America.,All right.,There you go.,What?,You okay?,Did you shoot me?,What?,No!,"There was a bird kind of near me, and I know how desperate you were to prove yourself.",No.,"No, I swear, I didn't.","Ron, I swear to God, I've never shot anyone.","Well, you better find out who it was.","And then, purchase them a coffin, because I'm gonna rip them apart.",Okay.,Marco!,Polo!,Marco!,Polo!,Marco?,Polo!,Marco!,Polo!,Hey.,Okay.,How are you feeling?,How are you feeling?,Are you dizzy?,Are you dizzy or Are you lightheaded?,"When I look at my palm, I see a lady's mouth French kissing a dog.",Is that normal?,Is that normal?,"Well, the pain medication I gave you is pretty strong.",Donna uses it for menstrual cramps.,How many did you take?,Seven.,Eight.,But I washed them down with plenty of fluids.,"No, Ron, you cannot drink Scotch with this.","You're gonna need to purge, right now!",Okay?,No!,"Oh, yeah.","No, I'm not wasting Can you open his mouth?",No.,Leslie?,Open his mouth.,What?,No.,Open his mouth.,Okay.,I'm not making myself throw up.,"Oh, Ron.",I'm sorry we have to do this!,"Ron, you have to.",Ron?,This is for your own good.,I will bite you!,Open your mouth!,"Leslie, get Grab his mustache!","Oh, God!",Open your mouth!,Just a Open your mouth!,His shoulders!,"Well, good news is Ron is resting comfortably.",Is he okay?,Is he gonna live?,I think so.,Although I am hoping that he has some memory loss.,"On a scale of one to Chris Brown, how pissed is he?","Well, he's very curious about who shot him.","So, if you did it, just say, ""I did it.",""" Come on, person who shot Ron.","Look, I think it's a little weird that nobody wants to admit that they shot Ron in the head.",Maybe Ron shot himself.," Hmm, he has seemed really depressed lately.", He was shot in the back of the head., You're right., He loves the back of his head., He would never shoot himself there., It could have been someone else that shot Ron., Someone not in our group., You think someone is hunting us? Man is the most dangerous game., To The Predator., I did smell something out there., And it wasn't human., That was pine trees., The Predator can see heat., We should cover ourselves in mud., It could still be out there.," Did you hear that? Actually, I did hear something.", Okay., There's someone out there., I'm gonna get my gun.," Okay, Tom."," Scare him off and shoot over his head! What's that gonna do? I'm gonna shoot under its head! Don't shoot anyone! Whoa! Where are you going? What are you doing? Tom! Hey! Don't shoot! Hey! It's Craig from Reinhold Mercedes! Craig! Craig, I got you, dog! Craig! Don't worry, I'm coming! Attention, person who shot me in the head! I'm gonna find you, and I'm gonna tear you apart.", Ron! Bed! Now! Okay., Here., That man wasn't my brother., He was my husband.," How was that? That wasn't good? Yeah, you can do better.", All right., Give me another one., Okay., I'm pregnant with Josh Groban's baby., That was good., You do one., Okay., What do you mean the squirrel took the nuts out of the Out of that kid's backpack and ate them? But you have to give me a reason to spit.," To spit! You asked me a Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.", Don't ask me a question., I won't., Okay., Not a question.," Okay, ready? Yeah.", I've lived in Pawnee my whole life., That is a fact., A fact about me., And how Hey., How is he? He's pretty out of it., He's talking about you in his sleep., Good stuff? No., How's it going out there? Terribly., No one will admit they shot Ron., And no one saw it happen., I know what happened.," You do? Listen, I heard about the accident.", And I need to know who is responsible., I don't know., Ron and I saw Jerry That's the problem., I am., I shot Ron Swanson.," You shot my Mercedes? What? No! No! Okay, follow my light."," No, not your whole head.", Just your eyes., Just Yeah., Okay., What month is it? November., Why are you taking the blame for this? Don't worry about it., I know what I'm doing., Just go look after Ron., So what happened? Did you forget to check the entire field? I find a lot of women have problems with tunnel vision., No., I'm an excellent hunter., How did you end up shooting a guy in the head then? Fair enough., I was walking in the woods and then I tripped and my gun went off.," Ah, so you forgot to put the safety on."," No, I always have the safety on."," I'm While I was tripping, I saw a quail and I shot at it."," In mid-trip? No, that's Okay, fine.", I got that tunnel vision that girls get., And that's what happened., End of story.," I think you're hysterical because of all the excitement, obviously."," So, I'm just not following your story.", All right? I let my emotions get the best of me.," I just I would I cared too much, I guess.", I was thinking with my lady parts., I was walking and I felt something icky., I thought there was gonna be chocolate., I don't even remember.," I'm wearing a new bra and it closes in the front, so it popped open and it threw me off."," All I wanna do is have babies! Are you single? I'm just, like, going through a thing right now.", I guess when my life is incomplete I wanna shoot someone., This would not happen if I had a penis., What? Bitches be crazy., I'm good at tolerating pain., I'm bad at math., And I'm stupid., I wonder what they're doing right now., Probably making out on top of a deer carcass., Super romantic.," You know, if I gave you a hickey, it would totally make Ann jealous."," I don't know, I think that would That's pretty gross.", Seems kind of weird.," What's weird about one friend sucking on another friend's neck? When you put it that way, it doesn't sound that weird at all."," Yeah, it's not.", I gave my gay boyfriend's boyfriend a hickey and it totally made my gay boyfriend jealous., Really? All right., Awesome., I'm in., I'm gonna go sterilize my neck., Okay.," What? You know, Leslie, the Super Bowl is in a couple of months.", I usually watch it with my brothers., Maybe you could come by at halftime and shoot me in the head.," Ron, I'm really sorry that I ruined your weekend."," Perhaps next time I'm enjoying some alone time in the men's restroom, you could invite yourself into my stall and shoot me in the head."," Look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you Sure."," How about you shoot me in the head? Oh, wait, you already did that."," Hey, Tom, can I talk to you for a second? Hold on, this is amazing.", Now., I need to talk to you now., Okay.," Okay! Whoa! Ann! Whoa, are we finally gonna do this? Ow! I saw you shoot Ron."," Okay? Leslie covered for you, but I'm not gonna let her take any more crap from Ron on your sorry-ass behalf."," Okay, for the record, I was gonna come forward and I'll do it right now."," But afterwards, can we come back here and talk about us? Maybe the next time I'm at the doctor's office getting my prostate examined, you could come by and shoot me in the head! Excuse me, everyone."," Ron, I have something to say."," Hang on a minute, Tom, I'm not done berating Leslie.", It wasn't Leslie's fault., She was covering for me because I didn't have a hunting license., I was the one who shot you.," You didn't get a license? What kind of moron doesn't get a license? That's reckless endangerment, my son."," That's a $25,000 fine, minimum, and probably jail time."," But she covered for me, and I'm in the clear.", Yeah., That's right., She kept her mouth shut and now you're in the clear.," Well, Ron, you know, I couldn't let I know.", You did good., You're a real stand-up guy., I'm sorry I lost my temper before., It was 'cause I was shot in the head by a moron., Yeah.," Dude, Ron, I'm so sorry."," Apology not accepted, moron."," Pants King! Pants Queen! Hi, Ann.", Hey., Mmm! Turkey's great.," Hey, Ron Swanson! Hey! Ron Swanson! Thank you."," Thank you, all."," Welcome back, Ron."," Oh, hey! ""Welcome back, Ron.",""" That's terrific."," Thanks, you guys.", Let's eat!   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 11,Leslie.,"What's up, Ron?",I'm gonna need you to go up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles on the fourth floor.,We gotta talk ourselves out of this late registration fee for the Parks van.,Come on.,I don't want to go to the fourth floor.,That is the creepiest place on Earth.,The fourth floor is awful.,"The DMV, divorce filings, probation offices.",Ugh!,"They put a popcorn machine up there just to brighten things up, but they used the wrong kind of oil, and a bunch of people had to get their throats replaced.","They'll only talk to you or me, and I can't go, because I don't want to.",Okay.,"Hey, boo.",You're pretty.,"Uh Thank you, sir.","Hey, girl.",Are you on probation?,I got clean urine.,You need female?,I got female.,"I'm good, thank you.","Hey, you clean?","I buy, too.",Order.,Order!,Next case.,"Indiana vs I know, I'm just telling you.",Tom and Wendy?,Popcorn?,"So, Tom, how's everything in your life, generally?",Amazing.,Took a risk.,Bought some shoes online.,"Paid off handsomely, as you can see.",Uhhuh.,"And how are your institutions, that you're a part of?",Ah.,You heard about my divorce?,I saw you on the fourth floor.,"I'm so, so sorry.","Honestly, it's fine.","Lasted longer than Avril Lavigne and the guy from Sum 41, am I right?",I don't know what those are.,"Look, Tom, stop working.",Whoa!,Would have been nice to have saved that.,You should've autosaved that.,Right.,That kind of feels like your fault.,"Look, I've heard your voice when she calls you on the phone.",I've seen you look at her ass when she leaves the room.,You love her.,"Leslie, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but I'm fine.","Look, look at my face.",Are you watching?,"I did a little research, and divorce is the number two most stressful event in a person's life.","Of course, marriage is number seven.","So, watch out, everyone.",It's all bad.,"We have to step up, for Tom's sake.",I think Tom seems fine.,"Well, that is the problem.",Tom always seems like Mr.,"Slickster Cool Guy, but he's actually hiding his emotions underneath a very thick layer of Axe body spray.",We have to help him.,We are his safe bubble.,She's kind of right.,"None of his family lives here, and all of his friends are frat guys and morons.",This seems like none of our business.,"Be supportive, okay?","Don't be all, like, ""No, I don't want to.","""I am a guy and I like fire and playing hockey and eating meat!","""No, no, says I!",""" That was a really good Ron.",Thank you.,"I don't know how to explain Hey, Mark.",The shoeshine stand still doesn't have that syphilis medication you were asking about.,"Ann, hey!",What a coincidence!,Are you in this office purely for business reasons?,"Pleasure, actually.",My boyfriend Mark works here.,He's sitting right next to me.,"Hey, Andy.","What a surprise, running into you all day, every day, every single place that we are.",Likewise.,"Well, I guess I'll see you guys around.",See you.,Oh!,"Uh, also, Mark, again, we don't have those extrasmall condoms you ordered.","I called the factory, it's gonna take a special order.","Not just because of the size, but because of the weird shape as well.",Something they've never dealt with before.,We'll talk.,"Mark never asked me for any small, weirdlyshaped condoms.",I made that up.,"Every day, I subtly chip away at their relationship.","Weakening it, little by little.",Where's Tom Haverford?,For sake.,"So, you had a divorce , of course, of course And no one enjoys a divorce, of course I don't know what to do, man.","I can't be like, ""Hey, Leslie, it's a green card marriage, I'm fine.",""" You know, Leslie just thinks you're a wounded animal, so her female instincts are kicking in.",Here's what you do.,"Act sad, let her pull the thorn out of your paw and wrap a bandage around it.",That'll make her feel better.,She'll get off your jock.,You still can't tell anyone about the green card thing.,Apparently you can get in trouble even after a divorce.,Damn the man.,"Well, hey, your secret's safe with me.","Thanks, Rondoleezza Rice.","Okay, everyone.",The rumors are true.,Wendy and I are splitting up.,"Yeah, I'm really hurt.","I'm so sorry you feel that way, little friend.","Why don't we go out tonight, hit the town after work, huh?",We'll make it Tom's night.,"You can go anywhere you want, our treat.","Oh, I know there's a really fun documentary about tandem bicycles at the art house.",It's supposed to be pretty unapologetic.,Or we could go to a restaurant Strip club?,Did somebody say strip club?,No Did somebody say strip club?,You did.,I definitely heard someone say strip club.,You just did.,Would the Glitter Factory be okay with whoever suggested strip club?,"I don't think that's a good idea, Tom.",There is a great dinosaurthemed restaurant in Patterson.,It is called Jurassic Fork.,I have gone there three times a week for the last 15 years.,Ooh!,"Dinosaurs, huh?",All right.,Sounds okay.,Okay!,"It's gonna be a crazy night, guys!",I will see you at Jurassic Fork at 5:45 p.,Yes.,Hi.,"Welcome to Jurassic Fork, where the only thing that'll be extinct is your appetite.",You ready to order?,Yes.,I will have the Jamaican Jerk Chicken VelociWrap.,"I'm gonna get the Tricerachops, please.",How do you want that cooked?,Medium roar.,Medium rare?,"No, medium roar.","For legal reasons, we're not allowed to make puns about the temperature of the meats anymore.","I'll have the surfandturfasaurus, and a couple of bottles of wine.","I'm gonna need a lot of wine, so keep it flowing.",I'm not gonna be drinking anything.,Just wanted everybody to know that.,I'm not a big fan of group dinners where everybody splits the bill no matter what they get.,"I ordered a TyrannaCaesar salad, and that's all I'm paying for.","Hey, check it out.",They got pool.,"Mark, you want to play a quick game?",Finally settle the debate about who's the better pool player?,"I've never had that debate with anyone, Andy.","Come on, we'll put a little money on it.",Make it a little more interesting.,"Andy, please.","No, I just figured because pool is all about angles and he's a failed architect that he might want to play pool.",Let's do it.,Really?,That worked?,"How to hustle somebody in pool, by Andy Dwyer.","Step one, find the person you want to hustle.",Invite them to play pool.,"Should they accept, you're in.",Here's what I think we should do.,Everyone should go around and say one thing that they love about Tom.,I'll start.,I really wish I could have your body.,What?,Ew!,"Like, tied up, naked, in your basement?","No, no.","I mean, you're in good shape and you can eat whatever you want.","Well, that was weird, Jerry.","Ann, you go ahead.",I think Tom is really nice.,"Also, if you guys want to give me your credit cards, I'll just divide it up myself, I don't mind.","Oh, my God!",Don't worry about it.,The restaurant will just divide it evenly.,Just enjoy yourself.,"April, go ahead.",Tom is the only cool person in the office.,Ridiculous.,Donna?,"I love you, Tom.",You're my little prince.,I just want to put you in a little cape and a little hat and just fly you around.,"Thank you, Donna.","Hey, garon.",I'm still feeling pretty sad.,Can I get two crme brles and another glass of bronto grigio?,"I thought I had Tom all figured out, but it's almost like he's faking being sad.",Why would he do that?,And that's game.,I think you now owe me $25.,Shoot.,"Someone had a pool table growing up, huh?","Hey, no, no.",What do you say we play again?,We'll make it a little more interesting.,Go double or nothing?,Why not?,Step two.,Lose to your opponent intentionally so they gain confidence.,Step two has been completed easily.,Very easily.,Mark is pretty good at pool.,"So, how are you feeling, Tom?",Are you feeling okay?,I like pretending to be sad.,I now see why girls do it.,"So, your arrangement with Wendy, it really was completely platonic?",Yeah.,"Never so much as even kissed, except for a little peck at the wedding ceremony for appearances.","Uh, now that you're getting divorced, I sort of feel like there may be some potential with me and Wendy.","Would it be okay with you if I was to ask her out, once the fake dust settles?","Yeah, why not?",Sure.,"Looking at her, I feel like she might be the perfect spooning size for me.",I'm gonna take a leak.,Oh!,"That would be $6,400.",I accept checks and most major credit cards.,Yeah!,Mark is way better than me.,I'm gonna I'm gonna say that there is at least a chance that I didn't think this through completely.,"I think I'm done, Andy.",Okay.,Forget money.,We'll play for something else.,You have nothing else to give me.,I have a Tshirt I tackled Eddie Vedder in.,It's literally priceless.,"Okay, how about this?","If you win, you don't owe me any money, but if I win, you have to stop bugging me and Ann.",What are you talking about?,"No more comments, no more showing up when we're hanging out together.",You have to leave us alone.,"That doesn't seem like a very fair bet, Mark.","So, if I win, I also get Ann.","Okay, fine.","If you win, then you get Ann.",Rack them up!,Somebody punch someone!,"So, how you doing, buddy?",Want some steak?,Champagne?,Think of something extravagant and we'll get it for you.,What do you want?,A cheese fountain?,A ruby?,A goose heart?,How about a marriage?,How about a nondivorce?,"Tom, I'm sorry.","Maybe you guys just need some time apart, you know, to remember how much you care about each other.","Leslie, think about it.",Does our marriage really make sense to you?,"She's a tall, beautiful surgeon.","I'm a short, beautiful government employeelclub promoter.",You're a club promoter?,Aspiring.,"The point is, I never meant anything to her.",It wasn't even a real marriage.,"Now, the sadness is pouring out of Tom, like blood from a pterodactyl after it's attacked by a TRex.",I have to take him to a place where he can't possibly be sad.,"Oh, crap.",We are going to the Glitter Factory.,What?,Not me.,I can't go back there.,"But if you see Jasmine, tell her she can keep Anthony, but I want my microwave back.","Okay, good.",You're gonna take April home.,"No, I want to go to the Glitter Factory.","Well, drop out of school and start doing meth.","Let's go, everybody.","Leslie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but once you go in there, you will see things you cannot unsee.","I'm a feminist, okay?","I would never, ever go to a strip club.","I've gone on record that if I had to have a stripper's name, it would be ""Equality.",""" But I'm willing to sacrifice all that I've worked for just to put a smile on your perverted little face.",So don't blow this.,All right.,Okay!,Lap dances are on me.,"I mean, I'm paying for them.",They're not gonna actually be on me.,Got it.,"I kind of feel like Jane Goodall studying the chimps, you know?",'Cause there are some feminist scholars who say that stripping is a feminist act.,There is a girl here that also works at Quiznos.,"She's really nice to me here, but really mean to me at Quiznos.","Okay, Tom, go put these in places I do not approve of.","Leslie, I'm gonna put these in places you've never heard of.","Yeah, I've been a little down.",Totally natural.,I'm getting divorced.,"But now, I'm ready to pull myself up by some gstrings.",God!,It is rough in here.,Is it always like this?,I wouldn't know.,Don't like strip clubs.,Smells like a wet mop in here.,And I get the feeling that every one of these women is running a lowgrade fever.,"You're one of the good ones, Ron.",Wait a minute.,"Hello, beautiful.",Strippers do nothing for me.,"I like a strong, saltoftheearth, selfpossessed woman at the top of her field.","Your Steffi Grafs, your Sheryl Swoopeses.","But I will take a free breakfast buffet any time, any place.","Tomcat, pull up a mouth.",This buffet is unstoppable.,"Yeah, I'm not hungry.","By the way, you're doing a bangup job of looking sad about Wendy.",Does she make scrambled eggs?,No.,Take it down a notch.,"You already won your Oscar, DiCaprio.",Coming on stage next is Angel.,Angel!,"Ann, in case I don't sink this, it's been a real pleasure dating you.",Scratch on the eight!,I'm victorious.,I am awesome at pool and I hustled your ass.,"Ann, take a moment to say goodbye.",I don't even know how to say this.,"I am so sorry, and I will do my best to visit you on holidays.","Thanks, you tried.",I guess you're his now.,Do you want to get out of here?,I do.,Yeah.,"Bye, Andy.","I know that, legally, Ann is now mine, but it weirdly doesn't feel that way.","All right, Tom!",This is Seabiscuit.,Sierra.,Sierra.,Sorry.,It's loud in here.,And I gave her money to writhe around on your parts.,"Leslie, I don't want to do that.","Well, I already paid her.",Can I get my money back?,No.,"Okay, so let her do her writhing.",All right.,"I just gotta say, Sierra.","I really don't get why this cheers men up, because it's very insincere and it's very fleeting.","But go crazy, okay?",Give my friend here the works.,Really grind the sorrow out of him.,You got it.,"And then, afterwards, maybe reconsider your profession, but for now, grind away.",Whoo!,Stripper dancing action!,This isn't working.,I don't want to do this.,"Is it because you have a strong, positive female figure watching you?",No.,It's because I'm miserable.,Okay.,Never mind.,"Thank you, Seabiscuit.",That'll be all.,"All Glitter Factory girls, please come backstage.", Tom., I don't know what's wrong with me., This is honestly the saddest I've ever been., Glitter Bomb! Ah! I've been to the Glitter Factory a million times.," That girl up there, she's my emergency contact."," But right now, I hate it here, and I just want to see Wendy."," Tom, it's perfectly normal to feel devastated when something's over.", It's exactly how I felt when that Planet Earth series ended., Sixty days., And then she's free to marry Ron Swanson., What? Ron? He's gonna ask her out., He told me.," But who cares? If it's not him, it'll just be some other guy.", Swanson! Did you tell Tom that you were gonna ask out Wendy? It's complicated.," What is wrong with you? I wish I wasn't alive to hear myself say this, but I am ashamed to be your deputy.", I don't get men.," If they're not wagering their girlfriends in pool, then they're trying to steal each other's wives.", It makes you question the whole notion of those bromance movies., Tom.," Great! Good, okay."," Could you carry him out of here, please? And, you know, also maybe not have sex with his wife? Thanks.", From the knees., He weighs eight pounds., Oh! Oh.," Oh, boy."," Hi, Wendy."," We took Tom out tonight, and he had a little bit too much to drink.", Oh! Okay., Come on in.," Oh, my God.", You insensitive little hussy.," Excuse me?

No.," No, that's his That's his boss.", My husband's the one that's being carried by his boss., How's it going? Good.," You know what, Wendy? You and Ron will be perfect for each other.", You two should get married and start a club for people who betray Tom Haverford., You have a lovely home.," So, where do you want this? So, how you feeling? Rough morning? You know those hangover pills you can order on TV? Mmm.", I threw up a bunch of them this morning., I feel much better.," I know last night was really rough, but all I want for you is to be able to get over this."," Leslie, I need to tell you something.", Okay., Uh The reason I was acting weird yesterday was Wendy and I have a green card marriage.," Oh, my God, because you're a Libyan! No.", Damn it., Wendy's from Canada., Oh! Oh., Okay., Wait., Start again.," This Hey, Ann.", Mark., You guys got a second? It's about last night., I hope I'm not gonna have to explain to you that you don't actually own me., Of course not., I never for one second thought that that was for real.," Look, you don't have to worry about me bothering you anymore."," You clearly have something going, and I should respect that.", Okay.," If you say ""psych"" right now I'm gonna be really pissed."," You remembered how much I like to say ""psych.",""" But no, no.", This is no psych.," Andy, thank you for saying all that just now.", Sure.," Goodbye, A-Cakes."," Hello, Ann."," Goodbye, Ann."," Goodbye, Andy."," Oh, oh."," I thought for a second you were gonna chase after me right there, but you didn't, and that's okay.", I meant every word I said.," Aw, you like your wife? That's a bummer.", Does anyone else know that you like your wife? Does your wife know that you like your wife? I didn't know until yesterday., So don't tell anyone., Don't tell Ron., It's my problem., How could there possibly still be glitter on me? It takes forever to get off., My crotch looks like a disco ball.," Leslie's sorry She called you selfish, of course She just didn't know the full story, of course But now that she does She's sorry, of course She loves being your deputy   ","

God!",Really?,What have you heard?,A lot of things.,"Like, ""Can you believe it?",""" and, ""The Parks lady boned Dexhart,"" and, ""Of course she did, she's totally good to go.",""" And one guy was like, ""I wouldn't hit that.",""" And the other guy was like, ""Me neither.",""" And then this third guy was like, ""I would.",""" So I don't know if that's helpful at all.","Well, keep your ear to the ground.",Okay.,I'll just I'm not gonna let these people intimidate me.,I'm gonna do my job.,I would be lying if I said that I never thought I would be involved in an incident like

I don't know, it's kind of a weird question.","I mean, I joined to put myself through college, and it's I'm just a desk jockey, but it's still It's rewarding.","So, yeah, I guess I'm in love with the Army.","Oh, Leslie?","Well, yeah.","Yeah, that makes a lot more sense.","Yeah, I'm definitely in love with Leslie.",That's affirmative.,"I know this seems kind of fast, but I feel like we

2004, a kid from Pawnee went to the Olympics, and it was reported on for over a year.","He wasn't even competing or anything, he just was going, literally, to watch the Olympics.",It was way too easy to get this guy here.,"Councilman Dexhart, this has gone far enough.",I want you to hold a press conference and clear my name.,"Mmm No, thanks.",Why not?,What's in it for you?,"To be honest, being linked to Leslie is a lot less damning than the real story.",You're like a glass of whole milk.,"What are you, Lutheran?",I love Lutherans.,"Councilman, with all due respect, get a grip.","If you don't hold a press conference, I'm gonna come forward and tell the whole story.",It won't do you any good.,"Take it from me, denying only makes things worse.","Listen, I gotta

first question has to be, when did the affair start?","Joan, I spoke with Councilman Dexhart for the first time that night.","We met for about 15 minutes, and then I went home, alone, and that's the whole story.","Well, Leslie, we all saw the tape from four years ago, and you were flashing some serious ""do me"" eyes.", That's just my opinion., I don't understand why I'm on trial here., You should be grilling Councilman Dexhart., You know what? That's a really good idea.," Let's bring him out! Councilman, come on out! Hi, sweetie.", Why didn't you tell me he was gonna be here? I thought it'd be more exciting! You look great., It's like I'm invisible.," Okay, my name is Ron.", You don't need to know my last name.," Whoever wants to talk, go ahead, and we'll be out of here in a tight 15."," I found a sandwich in one of your parks, and I want to know why it didn't have mayonnaise.", What's so funny?

Wait., There's no mole., There is no mole.," This exclusive story, there is no mole on Miss Knope! I can't believe it's come to this.", This is utterly humiliating.," Well, Councilman? Care to make a comment about No-Mole-Gate? Yes."," I really didn't think that Miss Knope would pull down her pants on TV, but since she did, I will admit that the rumors of our affair are indeed false.", Thank you.," However, I have no plans to resign."," Oh, great."," Okay, Councilman.", You know what? You're a class act., Thank you., I thought you did great.," When you get all feisty like that, it gets my heart racing."," Like I'm on a Stairmaster, except more, like, in a sexual Context.", I can't go to San Diego with you., My life is here.," My friends, my career."," I guess I just thought with everything that happened, you'd want a fresh start.", I know.," I really care about you, Dave.", I just I love this town., I'm sorry., You want your ticket back?

such a pleasure to meet you.,Pleasure.,Pleasure.,"Anyway, Leslie, I have to go.",It has been a super pleasure meeting you.,"I am gonna get into this over the weekend, and I will get back to you on Monday about it.",Okay.,Great.,All right.,"See you, Justin!","Okay, Tom.",Good seeing you.,I've been thinking.,"It has been a while since Dave left, and I think I might be ready to start dating again.",That's great!,"Oh, my God!",I have so many ideas.,"You know, I was only with Mark for one night, and then I was hung up on him for six years.","I dated Dave for three months, so if I continue that pattern, I won't be over him for Five hundred years.",What is your ideal man?,He has the brains of George Clooney in the body of Joe Biden.,Interesting.,Okay.,"Just off the bat, there's a couple of doctors I think you would love.",What about Justin?,"I mean, I feel like we kind of hit it off in there.","Yeah, I don't I have to think about that.",I don't I'm not sure that would work.,Really?,Is there something wrong with him?,"No, no, he's really, really, really great, and you're so great, obviously.",I just I don't I don't know.,"But I will find you someone, I promise, and he'll be awesome.",I'm gonna go do it right now.,"Oh, good, great, yes!","Go, Ann, go!","Oh, just one rule.","I don't want to date a twin, 'cause I've been tricked before.",Okay.,Yes.,I understand your complaint.,I have to go now.,Please.,Thank you.,Ron Solo!,"Hello, Tom.",I want to help you with your assistant search.,Why?,Just want to do my boy Ron a solid.,"I know exactly what you're looking for, and I will find you a reliable person.",Now get out there and find me an assistant.,Okay.,I left you three messages.,Did you get them?,"No, I've been running around all day.",What's up?,"I found the perfect guy to set you up with, but he's going out of town, so he can only do tonight, so I came over here right after work.",Is that his blood?,What?,"Oh, damn, now I have to go back.",Who is he?,"His name is Chris and he's an MRI technician, and he's really cute, and he's very passionate about his job, and I told him all about you, and he's really interested.","So, dinner tonight, and here's the info.",Thanks!,Wait!,How's he gonna know it's me?,I'll wear a red rose in my hair.,"No, I'll wear a giant red hat.","No, I don't have one of those.",What should I wear?,It's gotta be red.,I will just tell him what you look like.,Good call.,Hi.,I'm Leslie.,Are you Chris?,Yeah.,Sorry I'm late.,"Oh, don't worry about it.",You look beautiful.,Thank you.,"Oh, here, let me take your coat.",Thanks.,Sure.,"Well done, Ann.",I actually heard that.,What?,"Well, I went to Wisconsin for both undergrad and grad school.",Go Badgers!,Boo!,Indiana Hoosiers!,No.,Badgers.,Oh.,It's not important.,I'm just glad that we could make this happen.,"Ann kept going on about how wonderful you are, and I just had to see for myself.","Well, she's my numberone best friend.","I wish she'd told me that you went to Indiana, but whatever.","So, you're in charge of amusement parks, right?","God, that's exciting!","Actually, it's regular parks.",Like swings and slides and stuff.,Strike two.,"You know, isn't it funny how these setups are always just so awkward?","Hey, watch this.",I will now extinguish this candle with my bare hand.,Okay.,That really hurt!,Are you okay?,"Oh, God!",It looked so much easier on the Internet.,"God, I gotta borrow some of your ice!",German?,"Oh, my God.","All right, later.","Was that, uh, Justin?",Yes.,We are going to lunch tomorrow.,Great.,Did you guys ever date?,No.,We never did.,"He's just, like, a really amazing person.",Awesome.,Let's do this!,Yes.,Marley and Me!,Let's do it.,"Puppies, puppies, puppies!",I know.,Let's watch Marley and Me.,Brian.,"Technically, you'd be assisting Ron, but Ron really doesn't do much government work, so you'd really be working for me.",I'm interested in real world expertise.,I got a nightclub opening to go to.,Which tie do I wear?,I like the one on the left.,That was a trick question.,The answer's this one.,Tell me about you.,Tell me about your friends.,Be as superficial as possible.,I meet a girl at a bar.,"She seems kind of into me, could go either way.","I get her number, it's two days later, what do I text her?","""It was nice meeting you.",""" No, Zack!","I don't text her, ""It was nice meeting you.",""" I wait eight weeks and I text her, ""What's cracking?",""" So, do you enjoy it, being an MRI technician?",Great question.,Someone steps into the room.,"Imagine a mother of three, maybe she's a teacher.","She knows something's wrong, but she doesn't know what it is.",She's scared.,"In less than an hour, I know what it is.",What's wrong with her?,I don't know.,"But the best part about being an MRI technician is, I can see inside everything.",See that guy over there?,Lmagine being able to look inside his head.,Wow.,I know.,You could look inside this steak or this butter or this bread.,You can look inside anything.,"Well, if you look inside this bread, all you're gonna find is more bread.",I don't know.,I'd have to do an MRI.,"Anyway, it's good that you found your calling.","I mean, I've never even had an MRI before.",What?,I don't know about this.,"Well, I'm offering you a free scan.","It usually costs up to $2,000.",I'm kind of spoiling you here.,"Well, I am a little curious.",Good.,"Frankly, I don't want to invest in someone who only has three months to live.",Oh.,"I'm just trying to think of this as an adventure, you know?","Just getting right back on that horse, even if that horse is crazy and wants to peer inside my body.",How's that feel?,"Uh, weird.",Perfect.,"Oh, you're not on your period, are you?",No.,Does that matter?,"Well, not for this.",Okay.,It's gonna be a little crammed in there.,"Don't worry, I'll be right on the other side of that glass.",Just your basic assistant stuff.,"Taking messages, wakeup calls, Muscle Milk runs, condom runs, bottle service at the Snakehole Lounge.",That kind of stuff.,Sorry.,What do I get out of this?,Connections.,"Plus 19 grand a year, minus my 10% headhunters' fee.",I have to pay you two grand if I get hired?,I have a job to offer.,"In the immortal words of Rod Blagojevich, ""It's a valuable thing.",You just don't give it away for nothing.,""" So you never told me where you're from.",I'm from Pawnee.,"Keep still, please.",What kind of music do you like?,Can I answer that?,Sure.,Keep still.,All kinds.,"Very important that you keep still at this moment, Leslie.",I've told you that a thousand times.,Did you ever break your arm?,You can answer that.,"Here, I'll turn it off.","One time I was on my bike and some boys were making fun of me, so I chased them and I lost control.",I'm surprised you can see that.,"It was, like, three years ago.",I can't believe I turned the machine off for that.,"You never had any kids, right, Leslie?",No.,You've got a great oven.,"Okay, time to go.",You got ample room in there.,"Honestly, if you wanted to, you could go triplets right off the bat, Leslie.","You got a big, industrialsized oven.","So we're done, right?",Sorry.,I gotta get that.,Hey!,How's the date going?,Good!,We just finished the MRI.,What?,"Look, I know I said that I wanted to get back out there, but this guy is nuts.","Sorry, Les.","I'll find you somebody else, okay?",Just don't let this sour you on dating.,"Yeah, okay.",Hey!,No cell phones!,What was that about?,I set Leslie up on a date.,I don't think it's going that well.,"Oh, no.",With Justin?,"Oh, no.",This guy I know from the hospital.,Why not Justin?,I don't really see them together.,You know?,"Plus, Leslie just got out of a relationship, so I didn't want Justin to be, like, her rebound guy or anything, you know?","Yeah, that makes sense.",Leslie is a notoriously cruel and thoughtless person.,Why are we talking about this?,We're not.,You've got a large brain.,Thank you.,Yeah.,"Well, it looks pretty Hang on.",That's weird.,What?,What's weird?,Your brain.,See that shadow right there?,"Oh, my God!",What?,Is that bad?,I don't know.,I'd have a doctor look at that immediately if I were you.,Are you serious?,"Oh, wait.",Oh.,"It's, like, a smudge or something.",Crazy.,Thank God I was here.,"Mark, I've never gone out with him.",I swear!,"I'm sorry, but there's just something weird about the way you talk about him.",I don't know.,There was definitely times when we thought maybe we would go out someday.,That's why you didn't set Leslie up.,Because you're saving him.,"No, I'm not.","Oh, yeah, you are.","Okay, fine.","You don't have someone in your life that you think, ""I don't know, maybe if things were different, maybe, some day"" You know what?",You can't save somebody for the future while you're in a relationship.,Even I know that.,"Come on, don't go.",I'll talk to you later.,"And by the way, the dog dies at the end.","So, did you want to go back to your place?","Yeah, actually, Chris, it was nice to meet you, but I think this is gonna be our last date.",I get it.,"Get your MRI and get out, huh?",This was your idea.,Clever lady.,I guess I'm not as good a tech as I thought I was.,I should have noticed that you're missing a heart.,Ew.,"Goodbye, Leslie.",Right.,I drove us here.,Goodie.,"Hey, do you mind if we pick up my son Nate at his basketball game on the way back?",Wow!,This is really good.,"""Cease and desist.",""" ""Burden of proof.",""" Check out paragraph two.",I drop the Fbomb.,"""Frivolous.",""" Definitely have the city attorney look at that, but that should be enough to do the trick.","Well, Justin, I just I can't thank you enough.",It's my pleasure.,Maybe I'll see you around sometime.,Yeah!,I would love Mmmhmm.,I'll see you.,Okay.,Bye.,Bye.,Damn!,He is all right.,Why don't you hit that?,"Well, frankly, I would like to hit that, but Ann's being a little weird about it.","When you were dating Ann, did you know this guy Justin?"," Oh, Justin?", I hate Justin., Ann was so obviously into him., It was so annoying., Right.," I would say, in terms of guys that she's in love with, Justin's up here, I'm up here, and then you're down here."," Well, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't crazy, so, naturally, I came to you for reassurance.", Do me a favor., Don't tell Ann that we talked about this., Will do., Ann Perkins! You should be ashamed of yourself., What you're doing to Mark is not cool., Why are you guys talking to each other? You know what? Forget it., I'm not getting into this with you., You did something wrong? No! I didn't do anything wrong., Yeah., Come here., This is none of your business., You don't know what you're talking about.," Actually, I do know what I'm talking about."," Every time I used to sit around all afternoon playing video games wearing only my slippers, all of a sudden, I would start to feel bad about myself, and do you know why? Didn't you just explain why? I would feel bad about myself because I would start to think about this perfect guy."," Anytime you would talk about Justin, I didn't feel very important.", That was rough.," Well, I didn't know that."," Maybe if you had, I wouldn't have left."," But you do know now, so you have to choose.", It's either me or Justin., I'm not gonna choose., Wait.," I'm dating Mark! Are you, though? Yes! Ah! That close."," Ronald, I've done it."," I've found your assistant, and he's dope.", His name is Jean-Ralphio., Jean-Ralphio! Big T., What up? Mr.," Swanson, two things."," One, it is an absolute honor to meet you."," Two, who is that hot intern chick out there? Because honestly, damn! Take a seat.", Right., Here we go.," So, Jean-Ralphio You got him right here.", Leave a message after the beep.," Why do I want you as my assistant? For starters, access to the illest clubs.", And that's just for starters., I will work for you., I'll be on you 24I7., I'll be like your family., I'm here when you get here in the morning.," Sure enough, I'll be there tucking you into bed at night."," Don't worry, it's not gay."," Do we have questions? I think our only question is, when can you start? Right now, let's do it! Thank you for coming in.", We will talk., Cool., I feel good about this.," And, you know, you can hit me up on Facebook anytime, day or night."," You know that, right? Take care, buddy.", Boom., So what do you think of your new assistant? I want to punch you in the face so bad right now., What? Okay., Message received., I'll keep looking., Thank you., Bring me the opposite of him.," What kind of music is this? It's rock and roll, my friend."," Fast, smooth, handsome rock.", That band is really blowing up right now., They're number one on iTunes., Okay., I'll take one., There's your change., You are amazing! I like when you hang out here., I want to be your assistant., Really? You hate it here., So do you., I'll make sure you don't have to go to any meetings.," If anyone comes to see you, I'll scare them away."," Wait, April, if you had to choose between these two ties You're hired.", I just figured I might as well get paid for being here., Hi., Hey! I was just calling you., Here., This is a prescription for Denise Dogan.," Oh, my God, I'm sorry.", I'm so out of sorts., Here., Porter's Grill at 7:00., Justin's gonna meet you there., I'm sorry Chris was such a jerk., You deserve way better than that., If this situation is weird or if you feel weird It's not weird., You guys will really like each other., Thanks., I gotta run., I have another stop on the pride-swallowing tour of City Hall., Go get him., That's where I never find things., Hey.," Hi, Ann."," So, I just set up Justin and Leslie.", And I'm sorry.," I rented District 9, if you maybe wanted to spoil that for me tonight."," Oh, my God! Dark ending, right? I'm back on the horse, and this horse is a lawyer, so I'm looking forward to riding him."," No, wait."," Ten months ago, she was an intern who could give a C- R-A-P about local government."," Now, she's our newest employee."," To April! Cheers! Cheers! Yay! Jerry, come and celebrate! No, thanks."," Well, everybody, let's get back to work.", Where are you going? I want to talk to Ron about the size of my desk.," Jerry, you have to schedule an appointment.", Okay., How about now? Ron's not here., He's right there., I can see him., I'll let you know when he's available., Attagirl.,   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 14,"And it's because of you, our teachers, that every one of these recreation classes in this catalog shines like a jewel in Pawnee's beautiful crown.","Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, this year we will have to remove five jewels from that crown.",Excuse me?,Are you cutting our classes?,Yeah.,"The city took away $1,000 from our budget.","So, I'm very sorry.",How will you decide which classes to cut?,By attendance and student evaluations.,"So, just make sure your students leave with a smile.","My class is called ""Coping with Terminal Illness.",""" Hopefully your attendance is good!","Actually, no, hopefully it's bad.",Nobody's more upset about this than me.,I've been taking these rec center classes since I was in high school.,"It's where I learned hair braiding, and how to make biscuits, and French kissing.","The French kissing was just from a boy in my biscuits class, but either way, lesson learned.","Oh, my God!",You have never been to Carnival?,I want to go!,"We have to get tickets in February to go to Rio de Janeiro, Leslie Knope.",Okay.,I am on a date with Justin in Indianapolis.,"We've only been out a few times, but every one of them has been amazing.",Cheers.,"Last time, we had a private tour and cocktails at the Indianapolis Aquarium.",That fish over there kind of reminds me of my mom.,Why?,It's just being really withholding.,Justin is definitely the most interesting guy I've ever dated.,All I did was a little paperwork.,"He's being modest, it is thanks to him my family remains in this country.",And it was all pro bono.,"Oh, Justin.",You've got to try this.,"Oh, that's really good!",Isn't it great?,It's camel stomach.,Is it?,"I'm teasing, I'm teasing.",It's chicken.,Would you like to try the camel stomach?,No.,This is me.,"So, when am I gonna see you again?",Oh!,"You know what, I'm gonna be near Pawnee on Tuesday.","Excellent, yeah.",I'll plan something exciting.,"In fact, our date in Pawnee is gonna blow Indianapolis out of the water.",All right.,I'm gonna hold you to that.,Good!,You better.,I will!,I've racked my brain and I can't come up with one exciting idea.,"I mean, he once ate fried cockatoo with a member of the Thai Royal Family.","Well, maybe just have him over and cook him some chicken and tell him it's Pawnee cockatoo.",A dinner party!,That's genius.,"I'll invite all my most interesting friends over, we'll have this big rambling party.","No, I actually meant more like a oneonone thing.","I know what you meant, but I took your idea and I made it better.","It's called a think tank, Ann.",What is?,Our lunches.,Our lunches are like think tanks.,"Okay, I want you to come over to my house at 2:00 and help me get ready.",And make sure that Mark is coming.,So much work to do!,You're my best friend.,"Now, get out of here!",How many courses will there be?,Three.,Hmm Four.,Not including dessert.,"So, five courses.",Yes.,"Now, it will be five courses.","If I wanted to bring a large number of deviled eggs, but I didn't want to share them with anyone else, can you guarantee fridge space?",Just be there at 8:00.,"Oh, hey, Tom!",I'm having an A list dinner party for Justin.,"And you, out of all my friends, come from the most distant and exotic land.",South Carolina?,Save it for the party.,Can you make it?,For Justin?,Are you kidding?,I'm there.,Just don't invite any boring people like Jerry.,What are you guys talking about?,Nothing.,Don't worry about it.,What?,Leslie.,Hey!,Hey!,Check it out.,Just practicing.,Isn't that polish gonna get on people's butts when they sit down?,No.,"Okay, listen.",I'm having a party Mmmhmm.,And I thought maybe you could help me with serving and taking people's coats.,"I'd pay you, like, 10 bucks an hour.",My guardian angel!,I would love to!,Who's going to be there?,Really fun people.,"Ron, Tom, Mark and Ann.",That's great.,What's the occasion?,Justin is coming into town.,"Hey, it's me, Justin.",Take my coat.,"But please, be careful.",I got it from the king of Africa when we were walking on the Berlin Wall together.,"Really, Justin?",What instruments do you play?,"Actually, he's a pretty sick keyboardist.",Good.,I'm good to go.,That sounds great.,Great.,All right.,I'll see you there.,"Afternoon, Andy.","Hi, Kyle.","You know, right before you sat down, I noticed, did you have some kind of stain on your ass, or something?",What was that?,What?,"No, no, no.",You're good.,"Hey, Ann.",Hey!,"Welcome to my house, for the very first time.",I know!,I can't believe you've never had me over.,"Now, I can believe it.","I know, I know.",It's a little messy.,But I have a system.,"So, I just need you to help me put the finishing touches on everything.","This newspaper's from November, 1986.","Oh, the first rumblings of IranContra!",Don't throw that out!,I think I need to call Child Services and have Leslie taken away from herself.,"Leslie, don't take this the wrong way, but your house is like a crazy person's garage.",What do you need this birdhouse for?,Can we get rid of it?,I might need it.,What about this one?,"Well, if two birds come along?",Leslie.,"Andy's gonna come over soon, he can help us with all this stuff.",Andy?,No.,"No, no, no.",You need a team of professionals to help.,I have an idea.,"Hi, is this Maria Portlesman from ""Organize Your Life, with Maria Portlesman""?","April, come here.",What?,Shake my hand.,Why?,I can't tell if I've exfoliated too much.,I don't want to creep Justin out.,I want him to respect my handshake.,Why do you care about him?,Justin is hip.,Pawnee is the opposite of hip.,People in this town are just now getting into Nirvana.,I don't have the heart to tell them what's going to happen to Kurt Cobain in 1994.,"Hey, Justin.",Ew!,It's like touching raw chicken.,Damn it.,Gonna have to refoliate them.,"I'll need some help moving the boxes, but it's doable.","Oh, thank God.",How much do I owe you?,Please.,No charge.,I just appreciate the chance to demonstrate how valuable my class is to the rec center.,And I hope you'll keep that in mind.,Oh!,"No, no, I insist on paying.","No, no, I insist on demonstrating.",This is not gonna affect my decision at all.,"Oh, of course not.",Stop winking.,"Hey, Leslie, I forgot to ask you.",What are you cooking?,Five courses.,Of what?,Huh?,Of what?,"Oh, God.","So, how's it looking?",It smells great.,"Okay, the appetizers are almost ready.","And I think that they are a very good sampling of what my level one class does, which I hope you'll keep in mind when you're making your decisions.","Tania, like I said over the phone I know.",It won't influence your decision.,It's just that learning to cook is very important in this day and age.,Is it?,"Hey, Andy.",Hey!,"Are you gonna be all right, tonight?","What, 'cause of Mark and Justin?",They are just guests at a really awesome dinner party.,And I will treat them as such.,That sounds very professional.,Thank you.,"I promise I will not spit in anyone's food, unless they should request that I do.",Good.,Did I do this right?,I don't know.,"Hey, Mark.",Hey.,Welcome to my humble abode.,"Well, thank you.",Whoa!,This is way cleaner than the last time I was here.,You've been here?,Right.,When was Mark here before?,Oh!,Sex.,I can't wait to talk to Justin again.,Last time he told me about how he snorkeled with whale sharks in Madagascar.,That was after I told him that I sometimes go swimming at the Y.,"Oh, thank you, son.",Leslie Knope.,I believe you've arranged accommodations for these.,"Yes, I have.","Hey, Ron Swanson.","You didn't happen to hear about the incident with Mayor Gunderson's dog, did you?","Oh, my God.","It was a blood bath No, no, no!",No talking.,Everybody stop talking until Justin gets here.,Don't use up your stories.,"Well, I think somebody from Animal Services is gonna get canned.","Oh, my God.",What part of not talking do you not understand?,"Please, have a good time and shut your mouth.",I just want this dinner party to go well.,There are very few things I've asked for in this world.,To build a new park from scratch.,To eventually become president.,And to one day solve a murder on a train.,I think it's fair to add this to the list.,"Guys, Justin's here!",That's Justin.,Everybody start talking.,Hey!,Hey.,Hi.,Sorry I'm a little bit late.,That's okay.,Welcome to my very interesting party.,Andy Dwyer!,Can't wait to catch up with this guy.,"All right, Justin.","May I take your coat, sir?","Why, yeah.",Thank you.,"I can't wait, I'm gonna get to hang out with all your friends tonight.","I know, it's gonna be super fun.",It's gonna be a blast.,"Really, really, just like the best, most exciting night of your life.",I cannot overhype it enough.,All right.,Let's get started!,Okay!,Good.,Yeah.,"What's up, J?","How you doing, man?",How are you?,Justin.,I have the swine flu.,"Oh No, she doesn't.",Yo.,Yo.,Is that Justin's coat?,"Oh, yeah.",Isn't it awesome?,"He got it in Cambodia, when he was hiking Mount Everest.",Let's put chewed up gum in his pockets.,That's genius.,But I can't.,"Leslie's being super cool to me, and I can't screw over her boyfriend's jacket.",I'll do it when you're not in the room then.,That would be terrible.,I'm being sarcastic.,That would be awesome.,"God, India is so amazing.",Let me tell you something.,That is my absolute favorite place to travel.,Where did you say your parents were from?,The south part.,The southern part's always the best part of anything.,"Have you ever been to the Kaniman Mosque, down in Tamil Nadu?",Are you kidding?,My uncle practically runs the place.,I've prayed there.,It's sick.,"Tell me everything, right now.","One sec, I just got to hit the loo, as those bastard British lmperialists would say.","The last time I was in India, I was eight years old and I stayed inside the whole time playing video games.",I got to bone up.,Fourth largest coal reserves in the world.,This is the best Old Fashioned I have ever had.,Where'd you find this bartender?,Oh I think I don't know.,"Like, maybe the Yellow Pages.",There's no way that you're paying him enough.,"Well, if you want, I could teach you the secret to great Leslie.","Ann, get over here!",I'm here.,Already.,Good.,"Okay, do you think this party's going well?","I mean, can you see Justin?",Is he having fun?,Justin is over there talking to Mark.,Happily.,"Okay, good.","Yeah, good.","I'm just gonna casually make my So my face is literally on fire, but it's this weird chemical, so no one can see the flames.","I'm dancing around, freaking out.",I end up having to dunk my face into a bucket of sand.,Unreal!,Unreal!,"Oh, my God, that is unbelievable.","Oh, my God, that's Isn't it, Ann?",Unbelievable.,Didn't happen to me.,It was a kid I knew from camp.,But a great story's a great story.,"Well, plus, the kid can't tell it, his mouth melted.",Dinner is served!,Oh!,Excellent!,Hey.,I'm sorry.,Are we late?,What the hell are you doing?,How could you invite Wendy when Ron's here?,He's gonna wrap her up in his moustache and take her home.,"We agreed that we should invite interesting people for Justin, and Wendy is an interesting person!",I've been telling you for weeks that you should tell her how you feel.,Now's your chance!,"Oh, yeah.",That makes sense.,"No, it doesn't!","Not cool, at all!",He'll get over it.,"No, I won't.",The first course is a Mexican bean soup.,Are these peppers for consuming?,I wouldn't.,They're very hot.,I'm gonna give it a try.,Hot.,You're very brave.,"Please, that was one of the tiny ones.",This is how you eat it!,"Don't do that, Tom!","This is something, Justin.","Derek and Ben are gay, but often, on occasion, April will have relations with Derek.",Right?,Crazy stuff.,Discuss that.,There's not much more to discuss.,You kind of explained it all.,Who else is gay?,"Tom, I need your help.",There was a lull.,I saw Justin yawn.,Please tell me that yawning is a sign of excitement in India or something.,"Tom, focus!","God, you're no help.","Yes, just to be clear, this will in no way influence me.",It won't affect my decision.,And it has no bearing on the future of your class.,"Hey, little buddy!",Everything okay?,That took a long time.,Poor Tommy.,He has a very frail colon.,"I feel your pain, brother.",The hottest thing I ever put into my mouth was in this remote village in Southern Brazil.,This sounds good.,Yeah.,They take a little bit of scorpion poison and they serve I wonder who that is.,Who could that be?,More people?,A belly dancer?,What?,"It's weird, but she just showed up.","I mean, I'm not the kind of person that's gonna throw someone out, or, you know, not let them in if they randomly show up.",I don't know how they all got here.,"You know, people hear about a killer party at Knope's house, they all come running.","You don't do origami every day, do ya?"," They brought in a little entertainment, thank God."," That Justin, he's so boring.", What are you talking about? He's incredible., Yeah.," He's not gay, but if he were, I would totally break up with Ben for him."," Yeah, I would understand."," He's amazing, right, April? Right, April? Don't we love him? Yeah.", He's actually kind of awesome., You're underage.," I could lose my liquor license, I'm sorry.", Andy., Hey.," Are you having fun? All I can say is, this is not what I was expecting.", I cannot believe there's more., There's not.," Miss Knopes, I understand that you're currently evaluating the rec center teachers."," You're doing what, Leslie? I demand an evaluation.", Okay.," What course do you teach? When it comes to choosing accounting software, there's no accounting for taste."," The advantage of QuickBooks Pro is that it's easy to assemble a list of vendors Well, this is great."," I'm heading home, so as not to have to be here anymore."," My office, first thing tomorrow."," Yeah, I think we're probably gonna take off, too.", The demonstration takes another 45 minutes.," Yeah, guys, please."," Everybody, can you just stay? Okay? Justin, would you Oh, my God."," I promise you, Miss Knope, this disciplinary committee will go over every detail of what happened last night.", And we will determine whether you are guilty of abusing your power., Do you have anything to say before we begin? Just that I am looking forward to the truth coming out., I would like to say that Leslie is incapable of using people for her own gain.," Thank you, Tom."," But I can't, because Leslie loves using people for her own gain."," If I may, Phil, I'd like to say something to Tom on the record.", This has all been on the record., I'm very sorry that I invited Wendy to the party.," Is Wendy one of the teachers? No, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife.", And hopefully-then-to-be future-wife.," Look, I'm really sorry.", I put a new romance in front of an old friendship., Okay., I put a beautiful man in front of an adorable man-child., You're ruining it., I put a big white stallion in front of a little brown pony., Totally uncalled for., Ron Swanson will be next.," When it comes to government hearings, the only type of witness I enjoy being is a hostile one.", That's why I intend to answer every one of their questions with a question.," Were you aware that all of the entertainment and food was provided by rec center teachers? Would I have stayed if I knew that? I don't know, would you have? Would you have? No.", I wouldn't have., Did you hear Leslie make any promises? What constitutes a promise? A quid pro quo., Oh! Do you know Latin? Okay.," Thank you, Ron.", Are we done? Can I get a shine? Oh., No., I'm sorry.," We're closed, due to betrayment."," Well, I'm sorry.", But I don't know what you're talking about.," Why don't you ask your new best friend, whose name is Justin.", Justin? Yes., I would., But he's probably too busy cleaning gum out of his coat pockets., Wow., Unbetrayed.," So, you don't work for the government and you had no idea that these people were teachers from the local rec center? No.", I was simply attending a dinner party at my friend's house.," Why is he here, Miss Knope? That will become clear.", Mr.," Anderson, could you please describe that evening? Well, I had a very pleasant time."," And from my perspective, there was no abuse of power with respect to Miss Knope and any of her various guests."," Could you define pleasant? Did you have a good time? Did you have a great time? Be specific, and do remember that you're under oath.", I had an amazing time., But you fell asleep.," Oh, God.", I'm so sorry.," You know, look, I'd been given a case the night before, so I had to stay up all night working on it and I didn't want to cancel.", You should've told me., I would've rescheduled., Are you kidding me? I was looking forward to it., I had an awesome time which had nothing to do with the rec center teachers., No further questions., Okay.," We're going to take a break, and we'll let you know what we decide in about an hour.", Great., I will see you later.," I'm in the middle of official business, so I can't talk about it right now.", Okay., Okay.," But, yes, yes, you will."," So, did you get that? He said amazing and awesome."," So, I'm gonna drive up and see him next weekend.", There's some Kabuki theater festival happening., Great., You're so relaxed.," You're not freaking out about this at all? Okay, Leslie.", We've reached our decision., We're not going to take any further action at this time., Thank you., It really helped that you asked for this hearing yourself., And that you made financial restitution out of your own pocket., But I think we both know you skirted a line here.," You turned yourself in? Why? Well, I did something wrong, and I felt bad."," So, this morning I donated $1,000 to the rec center, so everybody could keep teaching their classes."," Okay, so why did you ask for the hearing? Are you kidding, Ann? It's every girl's dream to ask a dude how their date went under penalty of perjury.", I'm not proud of my actions.," But the most important thing is, there is now an official government document that proves my dinner party kicked ass.", Tommy Hav.," J Train! What's up, brother? This might be none of my business, but you need to ask Wendy out."," For reals, this time.", Did Leslie tell you No., She didn't need to., I saw it.," I'm not gay, but you're the most incredible man I've ever met.", That doesn't sound gay at all., See you around., Take care.," Bye, brother.", You sure you don't want to come hang out for a minute?   ,"

your company made 30 years ago.","I'm Nick Newport, president of Sweetums, giving you a look inside our corn syrup factory.","This is allnew, highfructose corn syrup, a miracle product that's sweeter than sugar, but cheaper to produce!","Cheap, delicious, sugary corn is currently being used by farms to fatten up their cows and pigs.",Look how fat those cows are!,"Fat, happy and docile, the way we like them.","So, you still want to claim that corn syrup is healthy?","Corn syrup is natural, and it's fine in moderation.",But don't take my word for it.,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.","Nick Newport, Jr!",All right!,What's going on?,Yeah!,How you doing?,Yeah!,Yeah!,That's what I'm saying!,"My kids, Denver and Dakota!","Come on down, guys!",I just wanna get That's

grindstone.,"Awesome seeing you, dudes.",See you.,"Later, bro.", Hi., Hi.," God, this is so weird."," It's, like, end of an era, huh? It's kind of sad."," Yeah, we'll still be friends.", Yeah.," Well, hey, you guys must be starving."," You want me to order you pizza or something? Oh, that'd be great, yeah.", Okay.," Why don't you get some Canadian bacon on it, since you're from Canada.", Mmm-hmm.," And sausage, 'cause I am brown and spicy."," Okay, all right."," Well, I will see you around, I guess.", Yeah., Right? I'm around., I'll see you around., Bye., Bye., Wow., Mr.," Newport, Jr."," , thank you so much for coming."," But don't you think that every person has a right to know what they're putting in their bodies? Right, everybody? Is Shoelace here? Where's Shoelace? Shoelace couldn't make it.", Aw! But I do agree with this nice lady., That's why I say we should let the people be the judge.," Denver? Everybody! Check under your seats! Look, look! I got chocolate! Denver, you little son of a bitch.", Mmm.," There's no pizza left? Sorry, Jer.", Too slow.," Do you want my crusts? Here, take this.", Nobody even told me the pizza was here., Jerry! You stepped on DJ Roomba! That was an accident., You killed him! I built him myself., He was like a son to me., Okay., Time to vote.," All those who would like the bloated corpse of the government to keep running the snack bars at taxpayer expense, raise your hands.", That seems like an unfair phrasing.," And all those in favor of letting this heartless corporation, Sweetums, stuff your children with sugary crap, raise your hand."," Thank you, everybody.", I can't believe this., You know what? We did our job., We informed the public., That's all we can do.," I'm sorry, man.", There's nothing we can do.," Are you serious? Look, we'll get it fixed and I'll see you Monday.", I just got off the phone with my new landlord.," Apparently, there's been some sort of gas leak and I can't move into my place until Monday now."," Are you telling us we have to unload this and move it back in the house? No, I can't put it there.", I promised Wendy I'd be out of here tonight., I got it.," Everybody go home, pack away my stuff in your own houses."," Then on Monday, pack it back up, meet me at my new place, unload it there."," Come on, guys."," See you, Tom.", Bye., Later.," Hey, bro, wanna go get our grub on?

Okay.", I'm leaving., We're just kidding., Let's go to dinner., I'm not hungry., And you guys aren't being funny., Why are you being weird? We make fun of people like that., That's what we do.," You know, for a gay couple, you guys are being really gay."," I said, ""Of course I remember you."," You're Chastity, right?"" Leslie! Even though I didn't invite you, you came here anyway."," I respect that, because you made a choice as a free American."," What are you eating? I call this ""turf and turf.",""" It's a 16-ounce T-bone and a 24-ounce porterhouse."," Also, whiskey and a cigar.", I'm gonna consume all of this at the same time because I am a free American.," No cigars inside, sir.", Fine., I will smoke the entire thing outside.," Even though it is bad for me, I am going to do it.", Why is he being such an ass?

No.," If you're gonna drink, you should use it, okay? I'm gonna head out."," By the way, maybe it's none of my business, but if you eat three pounds of steak every day, you're gonna die, and although I've already written your eulogy, and it's incredibly touching, I would prefer not to give it for a while."," The first line, by the way?

I didn't have time to have breakfast., I'm gonna toss these in the dumpster outside., And I don't wanna see you digging around in there later., I am sorry., I have been a horse's ass., And that is the end of what I have to say., Apology accepted., Put a coat on., It's freezing outside., Jerry!

said, ""I am now.",""" So they sneak out to meet each other and walk on the beach.","And two weeks later, he asked her to marry him and move to Illinois.","But her parents thought she was too young, so she said no.","And then they lost touch, and a few years later she met my dad.",I gotta take one of those lifeguard courses.,Those guys get all the action.,"Am I right, Justin?",We gotta find this guy.,Frank?,He's probably married or dead.,What's the difference?,"Am I right, Justin?","Well, at least let me try and find him.",Imagine how much better that story would be if we actually reunited them?,I think Justin's right.,You should let him do this.,Okay.,Do it.,"But if you find him and he's weird, like a ventriloquist, or a puppeteer, or anyone who pretends toys are people, then abort the mission.",Absolutely.,Absolutely.,"You, you're the best girlfriend ever.",Aw!,Happy Valentine's Day.,"I knew, eventually, somehow, being in a relationship with you would totally pay off.",I bought him some actual towels.,He was using a bathrobe.,"And I bought him some other things that humans usually use, like shampoo.","Troops, gather around.",Great news.,"The Senior Center Valentine's Dance is tomorrow, from 5:00 to 9:00.",Are we talking a.,m.,or p.,m?,Those people are old.,"Am I right, Justin?",Oh!,Justin's not here.,"It isn't just a job, gang, we're gonna learn a lot from these seniors.",Some of them have been married for half a century.,"And no offense, but everybody here is terrible at love.","Divorced, dating a gay guy, divorced twice, jury's still out on you two.","And Jerry, who knows.",I've been happily married for 28 years.,"You've met my wife, Gayle, many times.",Whatever.,"Finally, Ann and Mark are our special volunteers, and they will be available whenever needed.",I didn't volunteer.,"Yeah, too bad.",You got drafted.,"Ask not what your old people could do for you, ask what you could do for your old people.",Terminator.,What?,"No, JFK.",This meeting has been terminated.,That is the Terminator.,Nice.,Where am I going?,"Well, hello there.","Well, hey.",I got your message.,You wanted to talk?,"Yes, I do.",Oh.,Have a seat.,Mmm.,Some champagne?,"Uh, no, thanks.",Come on.,This is Armand de Brignac.,JayZ drinks this.,"Yeah, well, JayZ doesn't have to perform surgery in an hour.",You don't know JayZ's schedule.,He's a renaissance man.,"Okay, fine.","Well, this is for you.",Oh!,"Well, it's almost Valentine's Day, so I thought it would be a good day to tell you that Okay.",Let me just stop you right there.,"Look, Tommy, I just want you to know I'm so grateful for everything you did for me, but I only see us as friends.",For now.,But think about how much better our friendship would be if we added doing it.,"Seriously, I know our marriage was fake, but there's something between us.","And I think we should give it a shot, for real.",I just don't feel that way about you.,I'm sorry.,"Each time I do Just the thought of you makes me stop before I begin I've got you Under my skin So, there's that one, I guess.",All right.,You guys sound ready for the dance tomorrow.,"I don't know about these old fogy songs, Leslie.",Why can't we just do our originals?,"I just wrote a new song, okay?","Bottom line, it's called Sex Hair.",It's about how you can tell when someone's just had sex 'cause of how their hair gets matted up in the back.,It's awesome.,Think of it this way.,"These songs are exactly like the songs you usually play, except instead of modern rock, they're old jazzy standards from the '40s.","Okay, yeah.",You got a point.,Yeah.,You're gonna do great.,"All right, guys.","Andy, I've been here for half an hour.",Can I get my shoes shined?,"Kyle, I'm gonna lose my on you if you ask me one more time.",Found him.,"Frank Beckerson, 63.","Lives in a little town called Bridgeport, Illinois.","Divorced, no kids, worked as a lifeguard when he was 20.","Ron, I need a half a day off for a secret mission of love.",You're asking my permission to take a nooner?,Sure.,"Well, I don't know.",Maybe.,Justin and I need to go on a romanticallyinspired road trip.,So it is a nooner?,"Well, we're planning to leave around noon, so I'm not quite sure That's No, Leslie, that is not a nooner.",I tracked down this old flame of Leslie's mom.,We're gonna go pick him up.,We're gonna reunite them on Valentine's Day.,Is that a great story or what?,"Yeah, great story indeed.",Enjoy your half day off.,Thank you.,Pick you up tomorrow around noon.,For our nooner.,Which is a cute word.,Explain it to her later.,Explain what?,Happy Valentine's Day.,"First off, a bear in a paper bag and a heartshaped balloon.",I love bears in bags.,"Well, you will like this, then.",Because this is a giant teddy bear holding a red heart.,Aw!,Festive.,What's this?,"Oh, I don't know.",It's a heartshaped box of chocolates.,That's a dozen red roses in a heartshaped arrangement.,See that?,Perfume.,For the lady.,Yeah.,Ooh!,Ooh!,"""Yearning, by Dennis Feinstein.",""" Mmm.",Ooh!,Dennis.,"No, no, Dennis.","Finally, The Heart of the Ocean.",Gorgeous.,I never had a chance to get a girl a clichd Valentine's Day gift before.,So I got you all of them.,Thank you.,That was very sweet.,Do you think they'll get married?,"Oh, my God, what if they get married?",That would be amazing.,"Would I call him ""Dad"" then?",Hmm.,Hmm.,"No, that'd be too much.","Maybe I'll call him ""Pappy.",""" Pop?",Poppy?,PawPaw?,Look at me.,I'm getting ahead of myself.,Hey.,You never know.,"I'm gonna call him ""PooPaw.",""" How often do you get to reunite soul mates?",What if I told you that you could reunite Romeo and Juliet?,Or Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston?,"Oh, Jen.",I really want you to be happy.,Stay away from John Mayer.,I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Frank Beckerson.,I feel like I've known him my whole life.,Frank?,My God.,Marlene.,"Oh, no.",PooPaw.,"PooPaw, no.",I'm not Marlene.,Oh!,So sorry.,I should really wear my glasses.,Come on in.,"Frank, I was wondering.",My mom always said that you wanted to be a lawyer.,Did that work out?,No.,Never did.,Though I did once act as my own lawyer.,Oh!,I found some old pictures of Marlene and me.,Look.,Look how young she is.,These are amazing.,Probably shouldn't show you this one.,"No, thank you.",Your mom was such a firecracker.,"Smart, funny, sharp as a tack.",Such firm breasts.,"Oh, that was inappropriate.",Wow.,"I am just, all of a sudden, so nervous to see her again.",I'm gonna throw up real quick and then we can leave.,Hi.,Hi.,Valentine's bash at The Bulge tonight.,We can get you a drink bracelet.,I can't.,I've gotta work at the Senior Center Valentine's Day Dance thing.,That sounds amazing.,Can we come?,I guess.,I don't know why you would want to.,Because old people are funny.,"Yeah, it'll be like The Golden Girls.",I have to go get ready.,"So, Frank, where have you been for the past 40 years?",Oh!,"You know, here and there.",You know?,"Grenada, for a while.","Then Panama, then Afghanistan.",So you were in the military?,Nope.,"You know, I always wonder how different my life would've been if your mother had married me.",It would've been better.,I'll tell you that much.,Frank?,"Frank, are you okay?",I'm fine.,I'm good.,I am just so nervous to see her.,There is nothing to be nervous about.,Have you got a bag or something?,A what?,Do you have a bag?,I have a purse.,"Well, give him the purse then.",All right.,"You like potato and I like potahto You like tomato and I like tomahto Potato, potahto Tomato, tomahto Let's call the whole thing off.","Uh I mean, that sucked, didn't it?",Maybe if you sang it like Louis Armstrong.,"Maybe, yeah.","I mean, here's the thing, though.",Who is that?,My problem is I don't know how to tell if we're doing good.,"Because when you play a rock show, it's really easy to know if you're doing great because chicks will flash their boobs at you when you're up onstage.","And you're like, ""Oh!",That must've sounded pretty good.,""" If that happens here, my eyes will fall out of my head and I'll die.",Frank?,"Frank, are you okay?",Maybe we should Yeah.,Frank.,Frank.,Frank.,Frank.,"But I can't see anybody but you Flip flop You know, I might be crazy, but I have this weird suspicion that things are going well with us.","You know, I have that same suspicion.","But having never been in something like this before, I feel the need to ask, how am I doing?",Come on.,"No, I'm sort of serious.","All right, fine, forget it.","I'm just saying, you know, it seems to me, on paper, that this thing we have is pretty great.","Yes, nerd.","On paper, this thing we have is pretty great.",Mark is a great boyfriend.,I have no complaints at all.,Everything is good.,I don't know.,I don't feel right about this.,Are you kidding me?,This is so much fun.,"Look, we took a road trip today.",We chased your mom's long lost love down a freeway.,"He's a loon, Justin.",So he freaked out a little bit.,He got nervous.,"I mean, you would, too.",He was fine by the time we got him back inside the car.,"Yeah, well, he cried himself to sleep.","I mean, I don't know why you're pushing.",Why do you want him to spend time with my mom?,How would that help her?,I don't like this.,I don't think this is gonna work.,I'm calling this off.,Come on.,"No, no, no.","Look, we're here.",Let's just see what happens.,"What happens is, I drive him home.","Now, look.",You need to breathe.,I'm breathing.,Okay?,Mom.,Oh!,There you are.,"So, what's the big surprise?",You gonna try to check me into an old folks home?,It's a long story.,"One that we'd love to tell you over a cup of coffee, somewhere far from this place.",Frank.,"Hello, Marlene.",My gosh.,I can't believe it's really you.,Wanna catch up?,Sure.,"Oh, boy.","Oh, boy.",Do you think we should stand by She's fine.,Let's just let this unfold.,"Come here, sonny.",Let me tell you about the Civil War.,"Grandpa, leave me alone.",You smell like death.,I'm gonna get some punch.,Excuse me.,You guys are really adorable.,It's really nice.,"So Leslie's like, ""That's it, I'm taking him home.",""" So, we look over, and he's not even in the car anymore.",You're kidding.,No.,It's insane.,What does Leslie think about all this?,"Oh, God, Leslie.",I don't even know.,I think I just lost track of her in all the chaos.,"Anyway, so, now he and Marlene are off somewhere, doing God knows what.",I don't wanna You're suing me for alimony?,Yes.,"When we were married, I got accustomed to a certain lifestyle.",And I'm entitled to money to maintain that lifestyle.,This is insane.,"Yeah, it's insane, but it's all I got.",And you can make it all go away if you just gave me a chance.,What?,Three dates.,One date.,Coffee?,"So your plan was to sue me, and then to use that to blackmail me into falling in love with you.",Yeah.,Hey.,You guys sound good.,You really think so?,It's impossible to tell.,It's like Bizarro Land out there.,"As soon as we finish a song, it's dead silence.","Well, what do you expect, you know.",They're like a million years old.,"Well, I'm glad you like it.",You were always a big supporter of the band.,Hey.,Break's over.,"Ludgate, cracking the whip.","Yeah, well, these old bags paid for some entertainment.",So get up there.,"No, you're right.",Okay.,"Hey, you should play that song The Way You Look Tonight.",Hmm.,It's a good one.,The next one's going out to a special little lady named April Ludgate.,Someday When I'm all alone Are you guys Never mind., Why do you care? I don't.," Just thinking of you And the way you look tonight What about you? What do you do for a living? Well, it's been an interesting ride.", Yeah? I got a job at a grocery store right out of college just for a way to make money.," And here I am, 40 years later, completely unemployed.", Wow.," What do you say we pick up where we left off? You're not serious, right? I'm serious as a heart attack.", Of which I've had four.," And the world is cold I will feel a glow Just thinking of you And the way you look tonight Hey, Mom, are you okay? Did Frank leave? Uh, yeah.", He just stepped away for a second., I'm so sorry we brought him here.," Oh, it's okay."," It was very thoughtful, sweetheart.", It's not your fault that he turned out to be Excuse me., Hi.," Excuse me, hi.", My name is Frank Beckerson.," Marlene, you blew it."," Take one last look, Marlene, because you'll never see this body again."," Marlene, what happened between you two? Tell me everything.", I want every detail.," Hey, we're almost done, so we can leave soon.", Yes.," I'll take you for an ice cream malted, and then we can go choose our caskets."," God, why does everything we do have to be cloaked in, like, 15 layers of irony? Here's something un-ironic."," Ever since you've been hanging out with that meathead, you've become completely lame.", You know what? We're breaking up.," Fine, then you can't make out with me when you're drunk anymore."," Fine, then I'll make out with Ben.", Pass.," No, he's my boyfriend.", You can either make out with both of us or none of us.," Fine, none of you.", Fine.," I've got you Under my skin Everything okay, Knope? My boyfriend is a lawyer, and he's smart and interesting, and there's a lot of things about him I like.", But he acted like a real jerk today., I don't know., There's something about the way he treats people or something., He's a tourist.," He vacations in people's lives, takes pictures, puts them in his scrapbook, and moves on.", All he's interested in are stories., Huh.," Basically, Leslie, he's selfish.", And you're not., And that's why you don't like him., I told you so., It's Duke Silver.," Duke, can I have your autograph? I love your music."," You're mistaken, ladies.", Move along., I got you under my skin Yeah., Go Mouse Rat., I thought you were just terrific., Seriously? You sound like Dean Martin., If I were 50 years younger What? Wait.," Who's Dean Martin? If I'm not mistaken, that was the old-lady version of flashing.", Nailed the gig.," Look, it's sad, I know.", But we'll still be friends., We're gonna see each other all the time.," I come into town, like, every other weekend.", No., You guys can't break up., We can fix this., Let me talk to Leslie.," Tom, it's over.", She doesn't wanna see me anymore., Is it my fault? Did I do something wrong? No.," Seriously, this has nothing to do with you.", Can we still go suit shopping? Of course., Armani's having a sale right now., I'm gonna get you a pocket square., All right.,   ,"

to act in front of children.","You're not only coaches, you're also role models.",I would hardly call what he does coaching.,Wow.,Excellent role modeling.,"Apparently, the girls' team does not have a field assigned to them for practice, but the boys' team does.",No.,Not on my watch.,"Every child has the right to play, no matter how boring the sport.",Okay.,"Could you just share the field with the girls today, please?",I'm the girls' coach.,She's the boys' coach.,Oh.,Okay.,Sorry.,That's sexist.,"No, it's not.",Yeah.,It kind of is.,"Okay, why don't the boys take the field today.",And then I will make sure that the girls get a place to practice by the end of the week.,"And that, little lady, is a Leslie Knope promise!",I'm a boy.,Good.,Yeah.,'Cause I wasn't talking to you.,I was talking to you.,"You're a girl, right?",Yeah.,Yeah.,She.,Mail's here.,Hey.,Now what?,Jerry!,You got soup all over our mail!,You jerk.,"Oh, my God.",It's an envelope from the IOW Awards Office!,Nobody freak out!,Do you know what this means?,I am Pawnee's Woman of the Year!,The IOW is the Indiana Organization of Women.,I have been a duespaying member since I was nine.,"And every year, they choose one woman to win the Dorothy Everton Smythe Female Empowerment Award.",Winning is every girl's dream.,But it's my destiny.,And my dream.,"Can you read it, please?",Where are my ladies at?,Here we go.,"""The IOW is proud to announce this year's Dorothy Everton Smythe ""Female Empowerment Award Winner, Ronald Swanson.",""" Haha.","Okay, pretty funny.",It says Ronald Swanson.,What?,"No, no.","No, it doesn't.",I That No.,That What?,They only honor women.,And Ron's the opposite of a woman.,What's going on?,"You're Pawnee's Woman of the Year, it looks like.","Well, it's about time.","No, no, no.",They've obviously made some sort of mistake.,Bully for me!,"Congratulations, Ron.","Yeah, congratulations.",Congrats.,That's awesome.,It's very exciting.,"Awards are stupid, which is why I fully intend to decline this nonsense, and recommend it go to Leslie because she works really hard, and I don't.","However, she cares way too much about crap like this, which is why I can't pass up this opportunity to tease her about it.","Well, we can't stand around all day congratulating me on receiving an award from some lousy women's organization.","Back to work, everyone.","Hey, Freddy.",Good news!,"Your liquor license renewal got got, yo.",What do you mean by that?,I got you temporary approval from the liquor board pending fullboard authorization and council review.,Got got.,Thank you.,Thank you so much.,No worries.,You know the Snakehole's my favorite Pawnee hot spot.,I want to open up my own club one day.,"Maybe call it something like ClubaDubDub or The Clubmarine, sort of a submarinethemed club.",Or Tom's Bistro.,"The word ""bistro"" is classy as.","Tom, we are looking for a few topquality guys like yourself to become partowners.","A guy like you, with your political connections, I think you'd make a great asset.",I agree.,That's why I got into public service.,To help me.,All right.,"$10,000 a share.",I need the money by Friday.,"$10,000.00 ",That's chump change.,"I will see you Friday with $10,000.","All right, partner.",I just don't get why the IOW would give that award to Ron.,"Yeah, it's a bummer.","One, he's not a woman.","And two, they mentioned the Camp Athena project in that letter.",That's my project.,I started that.,It was my brainchild.,Why would Ron start a camp for troubled girls?,He wouldn't?,Exactly.,I deserve that award.,That award is mine.,Not his.,It's mine.,You know what you should do?,"I know, I already started a list.","""Write an email to Barack Obama.","""Lock myself in my office and scream until I lose my voice.",""" That's all I have so far.",I was gonna suggest maybe you just go and talk to him.,You're only gonna get more resentful if you don't.,Hmm.,"Hey, Ann.",How Ann.,I have so much I need to tell you right now.,"Hey, Ann.",Leslie would like to talk to you for a moment.,Is that all right?,Good.,JeanRalphio.,Big T!,"What it do, nephew?","JeanRalphio, I have a hot investment opportunity that you are gonna wanna jump all over.","Hit me with it, daddy.",The Snakehole Lounge Heard of it.,Is looking for investors.,No way.,"Yesterday, if you would have asked me, I would've said no, but thank God, my grandfather just died, so I am a flush with cash!",Awesome.,"I have 4,000 bucks.",All I need you to do is kick in six G's.,Six G's.,And then you and I are partowners of the hottest nightclub in Pawnee.,"Also, sorry about your grandpa.",No worries.,He was a dick.,Here's the thing.,I can kick in five G's.,"That should be enough, right?","No, it's not enough.",I just said I need six G's.,What about your trust fund?,My parents had it amended.,"I don't get anything until I'm 50, which is a waste, 'cause I'm gonna be a billionaire in Costa Rica by then, eating dolphins and hanging out with lady singers.",It's not a huge deal.,Just sit tight.,I'll take care of it.,You wanna come home with me?,Don't you work at Lady Foot Locker?,"Look, if you're not gonna pay rent, at least clean up your dishes.",Is that all?,No.,"Also, The Bag of Smells was a fun experiment, but it has to stop.",Come on!,No.,We're finally starting to get serious results.,"Andy, dude, I love you, but shape up or move out.",What's going on?,The guitarist from my band is driving me crazy.,He's such a control freak.,"""That's not a working fireplace, Andy.",""" ""Stop writing phone messages on the wall, Andy.",""" ""Dude, seriously, I love you ""but stop digging that weird hole in the backyard.",""" Is Mouse Rat gonna break up?","Well, we're not Mouse Rat anymore.",We changed it to Tackleshaft.,Oh.,I should just get my own place.,You should.,I'll help you.,You can help me?,"Yeah, that'd be fun.","April, you're like an angel with no wings.","So, like, a person?",Hey.,What's in the envelope?,Nothing.,You wanted to see me?,I think the Pawnee Chapter of the IOW has made a little mistake.,Really?,You're saying a women's organization made a mistake?,I was as surprised as you were.,"But the fact is, they only give that award to women.",Hmm.,"Well, it definitely said Ron Swanson in the letter.","Yeah, but it also mentioned my camp project.",Yes.,Camp Xena.,Athena.,Camp Athena.,You don't even know the name.,I almost got it.,I was pretty close.,No.,"Look, Leslie, your job, which you're great at, is making me look good.",Which you've clearly done well because I'm getting an award.,Right?,Yeah.,Be proud of yourself.,You deserve an award.,"Not this one, obviously, this one belongs to me, but some other one.",Some other lesser award.,"And if the shoe were on the other foot and you won the award, I would've congratulated you.","Congratulations, Ron.",What's that?,You heard me.,You promised the girls a field by the end of this week.,"Well, it's a man's world, Winston.",Get used to it.,I'm a man.,You know who you should talk to?,Ron Swanson.,He's an awardwinning public servant.,He's the guy that's gonna help you out.,Go on in there.,Excuse me?,"Ron, someone's coming in.",Hi.,Leslie said I should come over here.,"If you don't get credit for your work, why bother doing it?",Because I love it!,But I'm going to make a point!,This VIP card gives you exclusive access to the investment opportunity of a lifetime.,Where?,Multipurpose Room F.,When?,3:00 PM,m.,Dress code?,Black tie optional.,Just like life.,"Hey, you wanted to see me?","Yes, yes.",Just hang on one second.,I'm doing my official portrait for the IUD Awards Dinner Program.,IOW.,"No, this portrait is not official in any way.",I'm paying for it myself.,Did you need me?,Because some of us actually do work around here.,Work that often goes unrewarded.,I need your opinion.,Which of these objects most represents women for this portrait?,A pot?,Or this Deputy Director Barbie?,Isn't it adorable?,"She's got a little briefcase, her cell phone.","""I'm going to help my boss win an award.",""" How's the scheduling conflict with the soccer teams going?","Take care of that, did you?",Nope.,Passed the buck to Donna.,That's not really the attitude I'd expect from an award winner.,Everything I do is the attitude of an award winner because I've won an award.,"So, what kind of place are you looking for?","I can afford, like, I've always wanted a doorman named Ernie.",That'd be awesome.,Or Kipp.,I'm pretty flexible on that.,Here's a great one.,It's a Tudor mansion.,"It's got seven rooms, four bathrooms.","It's got a tennis court, a pool and a threecar garage.",What?,"And it's only $20,000 a month.",And it's in Chicago.,Ah!,That close!,It was almost perfect.,"Actually, there are a couple of cool places in here.",Let's go look at them!,Now?,Let's roll.,Okay.,Thank you all so much for joining me today.,I have two questions for you.,"One, are you ready for the investment opportunity of a lifetime?","And two, do any of you have pacemakers or a history of epilepsy?","Yes, both.",Anybody?,No?,Both.,All right.,Ladies!,JayZ.,Rihanna.,Audrina Patridge.,Jon Gosselin.,Lady Gaga.,Snooki.,Are these real people?,Cash Warren and Dennis Rodman.,These are just a few of the celebrities that wish they could invest in Pawnee's hottest club.,But they can't.,And you can.,"For the small price of only one, one, one, thousand, thousand, thousand dollars, dollars, dollars!","The only question is, who's gonna be my partner?","Mark, I'm talking to you!","Donna, I'm talking to you!",Jerry!,I'm talking to you!,Mark!,I'm talking to you!,"Twentysix certificates , plaques, ribbons, trophies, medals and miscellany certifying that I am the kind of person who deserves recognition for her achievements.","What do you have, Ron?",I have the Dorothy Every Time Smurf Girl Trophy for excellence in female stuff.,Dorothy Everton Smythe.,"I swear to God, I would Leslie.","Before you continue, please read this.",Another organization giving you credit for something you didn't do?,"""I, Ron Swanson, recognize that ""Leslie Knope should have received the IOW Award ""for all the hard work she has done, ""especially for the Camp Athena project.","""However, in my opinion, ""she is far too concerned with institutional gratification.",""" No, I'm not.","""So, I am going to let her dangle ""in order to show her that awards are bull crap.",""" Come on, Leslie, you know I'm not sexist.",I love powerful women.,You do attend a shocking number of WNBA games.,"I'm just saying that awards are political, and everybody has an agenda.","If you spend your life chasing them, you'll drive yourself nuts.","Yeah, all right.",But Dorothy Everton Smythe was a trailblazing feminist.,She was the first woman in Pawnee to wear

are insane.,"So, how much is this one again?","This one is $425 a month, plus utilities.",I like it.,"It seems to have a lot of potential and a lot of ""advantages,"" per se.",I could definitely picture myself doing something over there.,Can you hear that?,What is that?,It's still on.,You can light a match to get rid of that smell.,I feel really good about this.,Really?,It screams Andy Dwyer.,And I live nearby.,"So, we could, like, carpool to work or something.",Are you serious?,Yeah.,The scream just got louder.,"So, what do you think?",I don't know.,Make me an offer.,Okay.,"First come, first served.",Who's in?,Jerry?,"Jeez, Tom, if I spend any more than 25 bucks, I gotta ask my wife.","Jerry, get out.",Okay.,"""Mark?",What are we doing tonight?,""" ""I don't know, Ann.","""We could do the usual boring stuff like eat some chicken salad ""with some crackers, or watch the payperview, ""or we could go to my nightclub and do some dancing.",""" I don't think so, man.",You'd never have to beg for sex again.,"I don't wanna get into this, really, but I don't beg for sex now.","Forget about that, Mark.",Are you in or out?,It's just not really my thing.,"Bye, Mark.",Cindi.,Donna?,Maybe.,I like The Snakehole.,"Plus, I would look good pulling into my owner's parking space in my Mercedes.","Just to be clear, you wouldn't be an owner, per se.","You, me and my boy, JeanRalphio, would each own part of a share.",Will that be cash or check?,Not so fast.,I like to know who I'm in business with.,I want to meet your boy.,In here.,This lady's here.,"Hi, I'm Elise Yarktin, I'm with the IOW.","I'm Woman of the Year, Ron Swanson.","Yes, I know.",We are very excited to be presenting you with the Smythe Award.,That's what I called you to talk about.,I don't know if I can take all of the excitement.,"So, I think the award should go to Miss Knope, here.",Hello.,She's the one who really deserves it.,Camp Athena was her idea.,She did all the work.,You made a mistake.,We didn't make a mistake.,We made a very conscious decision this year to choose a man.,Why?,"Well, every year, we give it to a woman, and, frankly, nobody cares.","Yeah, the media has all but written us off as a niche interest group.","But if you give a women's award to a mustachioed, masculine man, such as yourself, well, then, eventually, people take notice.",I don't want the damn thing.,"Well, we're giving it to you.","So, you're gonna take it, like a man.",So congratulations.,"The IOW is a bunch of sexist jerks who need to get back in the kitchen where they belong, and leave the real feminist work to actual feminists like Ron Swanson!","Oh, my God!",What is happening?, Now do you see how silly these things are?, Unbelievable.," Obviously, I'm just gonna decline it."," No, I want you to accept it.", I want you to go to the podium and talk about how stupid awards are., And how they are superficial and meaningless., I want you to rip awards a new a-hole! Now we're talking., I tell you what., You write the speech., Don't pull your punches., I won't., I'm gonna push my punches as far as my fists can extend! Attagirl., Kind of.," What up, Big T!

You want this.", I definitely want this., T.,H., wants this.," Let's seal this devil's three-way right here, right now."," Step one, we buy into this club."," Step two, we roll over to the club, either in your Mercedes Benz or my pre-owned Acura Legend."," Step three, I dagger you on the dance floor."," Just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce Now, all the ladies say it Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce What do you say, sexy? I'm out.", Why? I hate that guy., Mr., Swanson.," Hi, welcome to the IOW Awards, and congratulations on winning."," Yay! Well, here is your awards packet, and if you will just follow me, we're gonna have a little meet-and-greet before the ceremony.", Okay., Great.," No, I'm sorry.", This area is for award winners only.," Get over yourself, Elise.", Work on the speech., Let's nail these women., You know what I mean., Yeah.," I don't know, Andy.", What's it all about? What's the secret? Yeah.," Why's it so hard to become a mogul? All I want in life is to own a nightclub on every continent, have my own line of upscale sweat suits, and a cologne called Tommy Fresh."," And I fell $1,000 short."," Seriously? That's all you needed? Tom, I have $1,000.", You can have it.," Thanks, Andy, but I can't take your money.", I'm a singerlsongwriter.," The two lines I've put into every song I've ever sang, ""Spread your wings and fly,"" and ""You deserve to be a champion.",""" If you're telling me that all you need is $1,000 to do your dreams, then I want you to have it.", Are you sure about this?

Okay, I'll take it.", Who do I speak to about getting this changed? Get off the stage! Yeah! I still think awards are stupid., But they'd be less stupid if they went to the right people.," You gave Tom all your money? Yeah, well, I'm investing.", I'm like Warren Buffay., I kind of feel like it would have been good for you to have your own place.," Yeah, I know."," But I feel like Tom really needed the money, and small sacrifice to see one of your best friends' dreams come true.", They cropped you out., Figures.," So, where are you gonna put it?

Valentine's Day.,Valentine's Day was a month ago.,Why are you giving it to me now?,Whatever.,Happy early Valentine's Day.,I saw this and I thought of you.,Hope you keep that somewhere special.,Okay.,"This is one of those nannycam teddy bears, isn't it?",What?,No.,"It's a regular, cameraless teddy bear.","Just put it in your bedroom, don't even think about it.",It's a robot bear.,It's programmed to snuggle!,I'll take it.,"Donna, there's a camera in it.",I know.,All right.,That's basically it.,"Water the plants, get the mail.",Can I read your mail?,No.,"Please, don't.",Fine.,Oh.,"And here are the keys, and remember I know.",Don't let Tom make a copy.,That's right.,Good.,I'm paying April 50 bucks to watch my house while I'm away.,"I would have asked Leslie, but I've seen the way she takes care of her house.","Plus, there's always been a little distance between me and April.","And I thought this would maybe, I don't know, give us a chance to get a little closer.",Maybe even I don't like Ann.,Become friends.,Who knows?,"Leslie, this is Evelyn Rowshlind, from the mayor's office.","Oh, hello!",I've always dreamed of you.,Excuse me?,Meeting you.,What can I do for you?,Have a seat.,I prefer to stand.,Okay.,I have kind of an odd favor to ask.,"Mayor Gunderson was playing golf last week at Pawnee Municipal, and he brought his dog and Rufus.",We all know Rufus.,Everybody loves Rufus.,He's a great dog.,Continue.,"Well, they were out on the sixth hole when suddenly, out of nowhere Rufus was bitten by a possum?",Yes.,How did you know that?,It was Fairway Frank.,Fairway Frank is this awful possum who lives near the sixth hole of the public golf course.,"And he's actually number three on the Parks Department's Most Wanted Pest List, right behind the bats, who like to poop on the bell tower, and Poopy, the raccoon who poops all over the high school cafeteria.",Shouldn't you take this up with Animal Control?,Let's be honest.,Animal Control is not the most effective branch of our government.,They're a bunch of burnedout morons.,"Well, you have the reputation as a person who gets things done, so we'd like you to form a little task force, find the animal and put it down.",A task force?,"Needless to say, the mayor will be very grateful for your help.","Ma'am, the next time we speak, we shall be dancing on the grave of a possum.",Great.,Ron will show you around.,Right this way is the exit.,"Yo, police!","No, you're not.",Coffee!,You always know what to bring me.,I only ever bring you coffee.,"And it is my very favorite nonalcoholic hot drink, except for hot tea.","And hot orange juice, weirdly delicious.","Anyways, thank you so much.",I need it.,I got a really bad case of shoeshine head today.,"Andy recently diagnosed himself with what he calls ""shoeshine head.",""" It's when you shine too many shoes and the fumes create a thunderstorm in your brain.","Cures include coffee, cheeseburgers and napping on the floor.",Mark Brendanawicz!,"Hey, Ron, what's up?","I have a woodshop, and I'm planning a little expansion.","Need my buddy, Mark the city planner, to sign off on the plans.","Sure, I just need to schedule an inspection.",That's not really necessary.,"Yes, it is.",But you'll be fine as long as you don't have any code violations.,"You don't have any code violations, do you?",Nope.,Eugene!,"Boy, we have a really important job for you.",We'll get to it first thing Monday.,Today's Wednesday.,"Look, this is not a request.",We're acting under direct orders from Mayor Gunderson's dog.,Office.,I need your two best guys to join me and be part of my task force.,That would be Harris and Brett.,But they're not here.,"Isn't that them, there?",Nope.,"Hey, Brett.",Yeah?,Dude.,"Listen, that stupid possum is on the golf course again.","Would you rather I capture it myself, and then just call you, so you can come and pick it up?",Okay.,"Hey, guys.",Cool!,"Hey, you want your ball back?",Want your ball back?,Come with me.,"Oh, man!","How you know my name, homie?","Stop, man!",Stop hanging yourself.,I'm gonna hang yourself.,Stop hanging yourself.,"It's quite a crack team you've assembled, Leslie.","Yeah, well, there's five of us and only one possum.",How hard can it be?,Excuse us!,Task force coming through!,Task force clear.,Resume golfing.,I used to love Tiger Woods because he was a great champion.,But after that sex scandal?,The man is a god!,"Hey, Mark.",Welcome to my haven.,Thank you.,You are the first nonme to set foot in this building in 10 years.,"Ron, none of this is up to code.",Sure it is.,It's up to the Swanson Code.,There's no drainage.,Doesn't seem to be any ventilation.,You've got hazardous chemicals over here.,"Yeah, which only I'm breathing.",It's the same liberty that gives me the right to fart in my own car.,Are you gonna tell a man that he can't fart in his own car?,There is a basket of oilsoaked rags above a woodburning stove.,"Good thing I've got a fire extinguisher, which, I can assure you, is totally up to your precious code.",This says it should be recharged June of 1996.,Those dates are arbitrary.,They're like those expiration dates that the government forces companies to put on yogurt and medicine.,Observe.,Watch yourself.,Yeah.,Okay.,I'll replace this.,Happy?,"How long do you think it would take me to learn golf, Leslie?",I could teach you.,I have a 16 handicap.,"But, you know, it takes a lot of practice.","You have to get up early, hit the range, practice reading greens.","Yeah, I don't want to do all that.",I think I just want some of those dope pants.,"Oh, my God!","Oh, my God!",It's Fairway Frank!,Wow.,Okay.,All right.,"Tom, I want you to very slowly Move!",Get out of the way!,"Five, Come on, Brendanawicz, relax.",Let me make you a canoe.,"Well, I don't need a canoe, Ron.",I need you to fix this place up.,"So, I'll give you Okay, we may only get one chance to catch this thing, so we have to play it smart.","You two, flank the left.",I'll flank the right.,Andy will come in to Andy!,I got it!,"Oh, my God!","Task force, engage!",I got him!,He's got it.,He's good.,I got him.,"Come on, you cowards!",Let me see his face.,Let me see his face!,That's him!,That's him!,We got him!,It's okay.,He's on my neck!,"Okay, okay, okay, okay!",He's on my neck!,"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.","All right, it's okay.","You're next, Poopy.","Very impressive, Leslie.","Oh, thank you.",I had a great task force.,I was just the simple mastermind who planned the whole operation and executed it to perfection.,"This is Andy Dwyer, he actually caught the thing.",Mr.,Dwyer.,"Please, my friends call me Andy Radical.","No, we don't.","By day, Andy Dwyer, shoeshineist.","By a different time of day, Andy Radical, possum tackler.","And by night, I do whatever I want.",No job.,We think that this is a great PR opportunity.,"So, we've arranged for a reporter from the Journal to stop by to interview, get some pictures of the team.",Task force.,Great!,"And next time you need a special favor from the mayor's office, give me a call.","Oh, my God, I will!",I need so many special favors.,Which one should I choose?,"Well, you don't have to choose right How about an extra recycling can?",No.,Laminated bus pass?,No.,What time do you usually go to sleep?,Because my best ideas usually come to me at night.,"Let's stick to business hours, shall we?","Yeah, all right.","See you in hell, buddy.",Am I sure the possum we caught is Fairway Frank?,Yes.,Am I quite sure?,No.,Am I sure enough?,Maybe.,"If it wasn't Fairway Frank, would I feel badly?",Of course.,Could I live with myself?,That depends.,"As a city official, it's important that I ask myself a lot of questions.",Does doing so help me make decisions?,"Uh Oh, hey, Shauna.","Hi, Leslie.",Hi!,Andy.,"You remember Shauna MalweeTweep, from the Pawnee Journal?",How could I forget?,You wrote the article when I fell in the pit.,"And then afterwards, had sex with Mark and everyone talked about it.","So, you're on the golf course, and you see Fairway Frank.","Well, we see a possum that we believe to be Fairway Frank.","So, for right now, let's just refer to it as a possum.","Let me explain something to you, Tweep.","When you're in a situation, you don't have time to think.","So, I thought to myself, ""Don't think, Andy, act.",""" So, you weren't thinking?",Not at all.,I cannot emphasize enough how little I was thinking.,Were you scared?,No.,"No, I wasn't.","Well, I I lived in the pit for the better part of last year, and made some vermin friends.",You know what?,"""Friends"" sounds stupid.",Colleagues.,"They are bad at sharing, but they are good at tag.","Well, your family must be very proud.",What does your girlfriend think?,The nurse.,I broke up with Ann.,Yeah.,Shortly after she kicked me out and told me we wouldn't be together anymore.,"Well, maybe this article will change her mind.",What now?,I hadn't even thought of that.,Wow.,"Of all the things I thought would bring us back together, catching a possum was never on that list.","Well, let's go take some pictures of Fairway Frank.",Of the possum.,"Seriously, man, when you wear these clothes, you just feel better than everyone else.",You know?,Yeah.,Busy?,No.,What's up?,"Just wanted to tell you, I understand that city codes exist, and I know why they exist.",And I understand that you enforce them.,Okay.,Okay.,Good talk.,Can you sign off on my plans now?,Did you get everything up to code?,Yup.,"No, you didn't!",You clearly didn't!,"It's my property, my land, my shop.",Ooh.,Tommy needs a banana.,You guys good?,"Ron, you're asking me to do a bad job at my job, and I'm just not gonna do that.","So, if you don't mind, would you please just get out of my office?",Ooh.,Silly me.,There was this little pompom on my glove and it fell off.,Have you seen it?,Could you help me look for it real quick?,It should be on the ground somewhere.,When I was putting it up.,See.,"So, how's your hole?",Excuse me?,The pit.,Lot 48.,"Oh, we're making really good progress on the park.","In fact, there may be some big news on that front coming soon, all because of this very important business card.","So, this isn't a really big story, right?",Nobody cares about this very much.,"Well, Fairway Frank did bite the mayor's dog.","So, this could be on the front page.","Fairway Frank You're gonna die You're gonna fry, oh, yeah You guilty son of a bitch You're gonna fry When they flip that switch Hey, April, can I talk to you about this situation with the possum?",No.,Okay.,"Hypothetically, if you were going on a mission to, say, catch a guilty whale.","And while you were catching the whale, you saw something else that may also be another whale, and you were like, ""What?",""" But then yout hought, maybe it's not a whale.",Maybe it's a big fish.,Maybe it's a submarine with a face painted on it.,"The point is, if I kill the first whale, am I technically a murderer?",I don't know what you're talking about.,I saw a second possum!,There was another possum!,Wait.,"Andy's in there talking to a reporter, literally kissing his own biceps and you're telling me he might not be a hero, but just some jerk that goes around tackling random possums?",No.,I've gotta help Leslie find the truth.,"Not because I'm pissed at Andy, which I'm not.",Because I care so deeply about possums.,Because they're so adorable.,April!,Did you see my photo shoot?,I think I nailed it.,"I fell off the stool once when I was trying to look serious, but I'm okay.",That's cool.,I'm really happy for you.,You are?,"Man, our happy reactions are super different.","So, he said he's gonna email me the photos in, like, six hours.",Do you want to wait with me?,"Yeah, that sounds good, but I can't because I have to go do something that actually matters.",Fairway Frank's been haunting the sixth hole for a while now.,You must know him pretty well.,Sure do.,I've chased that little sucker off more times than I can count.,Can you just take a look at these photos and make sure that it's Fairway Frank?,"Yup, that's him.",Mr.,"Campopiano, those are photos of three different possums.",Huh.,You guys want something to drink?,"Hey, boss.",There's a possum wandering around on the 14th green.,Should I call Animal Control again?,Yeah.,"Oh, my God.",Those idiots are here from Animal Control.,They're gonna take it away.,Okay.,We need a little bit more time to figure out the truth.,"Look, I have an idea.",I'm gonna distract everybody and then you get that possum out of here.,"Can you do that, April?","April, can you do that?",Can you get the possum out of here?,Can you sneak it out of here?,"April, can you do it?",Can you do it?,"Please, April, tell me you can do it!",Yes.,"Yes, I can do it.", God.," I can't kill the possum, because it might be innocent."," I can't let the possum go, because it might be guilty."," I can't make a good soup, can't do a handstand in a pool, can't spell the word ""lieutenant.",""" There's a lot of can'ts in my life right now."," Let's make it happen, Captain.", Don't call me that.," You know what smells? Help! Help, my arm looks like it's bleeding! Holy cow! Leslie! Oh, boy."," Oh, look how much it's bleeding.", Everybody look at it., Everybody look over here! I need everyone's full attention during this., That's a lot of blood.," It is, it's so It's ketchup! Is it? Jerry.", Jerry., Yes., It's ketchup., Sentry duty is usually approximately one hour long., Baby meerkats do not start foraging for food until about one month old.," Do you know them? What do you mean that Fairway Frank is not here? Here's the thing, Evelyn, we're not sure that the possum we caught is, in fact, Fairway Frank."," Leslie, whoever it is, it's a possum."," And the sooner it's dead, the sooner the mayor can do what he wants with it.", Does he want to have sex with a dead possum? No! No., He's not a monster., He wants to stuff it and hang it above the urinal in his office bathroom so that little flecks of pee can get on it forever.," Ew! Now, Leslie, you did a great job, and the mayor knows that you did a great job."," Now, where is the possum? I'm sorry, but he's somewhere you'll never find it and he's gonna stay there until the truth comes out."," And I will not reveal his location, no matter how much you ask me."," But I'm going to stop talking now because I'm afraid I may accidentally say where it is, so please go.", This is interesting., They put down a raccoon that bit a jogger in a park in Staten Island., Wow.," And in Walnut Creek, California, they put down a duck that bit a kid.", But security footage later revealed that it was actually a goose., That's great.," No, it's awful, Tom.", How would you feel if you killed an innocent duck and let a vicious goose waddle free? Tom Haverford.," Tom! It's April, I'm at Ann's house and the possum's loose! Okay? I need your help! Oh, my God! It's chewing on everything! Don't tell Leslie.", You got it., The possum got loose at Ann's house.," Oh, my God! April! April, it's Leslie Knope, from the Parks Department."," Stop ringing the doorbell, it's making him mad."," Oh, my God! How did this happen? I let it out of its cage because it needed water, and I thought it would just drink out of the toilet or something, but then it ran off and I couldn't get it back in."," He did that, too."," Oh, boy."," Yeah, and then I opened all the doors because I thought it would just go outside, but it won't leave the house! It must love tacky pictures of flowers."," Okay, okay, okay.", I'm gonna fix this., Let me just think for a second., Uh-oh.," What? Where is it? I can't see it! No! Okay, where did it go? I don't know! I don't know."," Here's what we do, we just go outside.", All right? Let's just go outside! Get in here! I haven't even started yet., I know., Thought you could use some help., Those city planning guys can be real pains in the ass., Okay.," I just want you to know that I still don't think city codes Ron, shut up."," Would you, please? I'm taking a half-day off to come and help you out because you're my friend, so just shut up."," No, I am bringing my workshop up to the Swanson Code.", And if the Swanson Code happens to overlap with the City Government Code Shut up.," I know there's a door there, but I kind of feel like it's going to chew through the door and come and jump on my face and bite me.", Ew.," I know! What if it's in here? What if it laid eggs in the bed? Okay, there There are no eggs! You know, we should've killed it.", It's so huge., I'm gonna call Andy., No., Yeah.," He tackled it once before, he can do it again."," No, please don't, okay? He's gonna be pissed at me."," I already ruined his big day, and it's my fault that it's in Ann's house, who he's obviously still in love with."," I just I don't want him to be mad at me, okay? Oh.", April., He'll forgive you., You think so? Yeah., We don't have to call Andy., We can just call Animal Control., Okay.," And, April, any time you want to talk about boys Oh, my God! Stop! Yo."," So, I feel like you were mad at me yesterday and I don't know why."," So, I made a list of everything I did and I'm gonna try not to do any of them again."," Also, I got you this coffee.", And then there's this., Fourth paragraph down.," ""But Dwyer had some help catching the possum."," ""'I wouldn't have been able to do it ""without an early-morning caffeine boost ""'from the amazing April Ludgate."," ""'She gave me the liquid courage I needed ""'to wrestle that beast to the ground.","""' Well, Miss Knope.", I have to say I'm very disappointed.," You didn't have to say that, you could've just thought it."," What did you do with the possum, exactly? Well, I'm proud to say that it's somewhere the mayor can never pee on it.", It's okay., Honestly.," I mean, look."," When I retire and I'm attending some gala honoring the first three female presidents in history, myself and two other women I've inspired, I want to be looking back at my distinguished legacy and not thinking that I owe my career to some possum."," And I want to be wearing a huge, beautiful, blue hat! Thank you so much.", Sure., It made me feel so happy that I knew somebody was here taking care of my house., Cool.," So, did the neighbors give you any problems? No.", Anything in Possum., There was a possum., We captured a possum and we brought it into your house and it got out and it might have laid eggs in your bed.," What? And it went into your laundry and your kitchen, and it touched all your bras and I'm so sorry.", It's our fault., We captured it and it got out and it ran around and it was a possum.," Okay? April, run! Run, April."," Sorry, Ann! I love you! I'm gonna go.", I think that would be best.,   ,"

buddy.","Next time, I'm sure it will definitely be one of us.",But it won't be me.,Because I always write Yeah.,Yep.,"No, I always write my own name.","But just to be safe, I do add 20 extra ""Jerry""s.","And finally, we are going to kick off the Children's Concert Series this weekend with a performance by Freddy Spaghetti.",I thought Freddy Spaghetti OD'd.,No.,That's Mr.,Funny Noodle.,"And he didn't OD, his drummer shot him.",Oh.,"Where is Jerry, by the way?",Why isn't he back?,How long does it take to fill bird feeders?,Maybe he fell into the toilet.,Remember when he fell into the toilet?,"""Oh, sorry, guys.",Sorry I'm late.,"""I got confused and took a shower, ""after I got dressed, because I'm Jerry.",""" David Meyers, the Jewish guy who works at City Hall, once told me something.","A ""schlemiel"" is the guy who spills soup at a fancy party.","A ""schlimazel"" is the guy he spills it on.","Jerry is both the ""schlemiel"" and the ""schlimazel"" of our office.","""And then I put my underwear on my head instead of my butt.",""" Okay.","Okay, guys.",That's enough.,Unless somebody has another good one.,Oh.,"Hi, Ann.","Oh, no.",Jerry.,"Jerry, are you okay?","Ann, is Jerry okay?",What's wrong with your arm?,"Ann, tell me what's wrong with Jerry's arm.","Jerry, talk to me.","Ann, get Jerry to talk to me.",Okay.,He's okay.,He's got a couple of scrapes and a dislocated shoulder.,Oh!,What happened?,You guys are just going to laugh.,Why?,Did you throw out your shoulder trying to swing a honey pot off your hand?,I was mugged.,Oh.,"Oh, my God.","Oh, I'm so sorry, Jerry.",I was on my way to the hummingbird feeders and I was walking Lord Sheldon.,Ew!,Is that code for some kind of weird sex act?,Lord Sheldon is my dog.,My wife named him.,Ew!,"Anyway, these kids, they came out of nowhere, they pinned my arm back, they grabbed my wallet, and they knocked me to the ground.",How did you counterattack?,Fist to the throat?,Did you hit him in the beanbag?,There's no shame in attacking a criminal's beanbag.,"No, I just curled up and laid still until they left.","Well, that's another way to play it.",Did any of them have weird tattoos or scars or anything?,"If even one of them had a unique scar, we got them.",I didn't get a good look.,"Damn it, Jerry.",Sorry.,You're the victim.,Sorry.,Sorry.,I feel like we're responsible for this.,Why?,We didn't mug Jerry.,"Well, why was he in the park in the first place?",Because we tricked him into going there.,I don't see the connection.,I don't know.,This is on us.,It's karma.,Wouldn't it be karma if we were the ones that got mugged?,Yeah.,That's how pathetic Jerry is.,He can't even get karma right.,"No, that's not funny.",Our friend got mugged this morning.,And we will not let that happen in vain.,He doesn't have a black eye.,"Well, frankly, the whole department has a black eye.","This is our wakeup call, guys.",Jerry's face is the symbol of failure.,Our failure to keep the parks safe.,I have some folders.,Inside are some assignments.,And some homemade taffy.,Mmm.,Mmmhmm.,"April, I want you to check in with our police liaison.","Donna, I need you to go to Ramsett Park.","Tom, you're with me.","So, when you say that you want me to check in with the police liaison, you mean hook up with him, right?",No.,Just check in with him.,Everybody dismissed.,Wait.,I want to help.,What?,"I'm going to teach everybody selfdefense, so you can defend yourselves.",We need it.,Because we certainly are a bunch of weaklings.,Especially Tom.,I am not a weakling.,Arm wrestle me right now.,Okay.,"I think I'm more than holding my own here Three, four, five Hey.",Six.,Hey!,How you doing?,Not too bad.,I was just dropping off Jerry from the hospital.,He was mugged in the park.,No.,Jerry?,The black guy with the Looney Tunes ties?,I love him.,No.,Jerry who works with Leslie.,That Jerry?,Yeah.,He got mugged?,Oh.,"Well, I mean, that's kind of a bummer, too.","Hey, while I have you here, what do you think of this?",Uh Scrotation Marks.,"I don't know what you're talking about, but my gut says no.",New band name.,"Because ""Mouse Rat,"" it's a great name, but at the same time, it sucks.","So, I think we have to change it just one more time Dude, you've got to stop doing that.",How are people going to become fans if they literally don't know the name of the band they're listening to?,That is a really good point.,I always had fun with Andy.,"The problem is, when you're his girlfriend, you're also his mother, and his maid and his nurse.",He's completely helpless.,He's like a baby in a straightjacket.,Ooh!,"""Baby in a Straightjacket.",""" That's a good band name.",I should tell him that.,"Haha, guys.",Really funny.,Where's the real banner?,We only had an hour.,So did I.,Look what I did.,"Hey, guys.",Jerry!,Welcome back.,Really.,"My gosh, you should not have gone to all this trouble.",Oh.,It's no trouble for our buddy.,Here you go.,Listen.,Today is Jerry Day.,We'll do whatever you want to do.,Anything at all.,"Honestly, what I would like to do is just have everything go back to normal.",That sounds good to me.,Okay.,I believe you were going to do a presentation.,"Yes, sir, I was.",I will go set up.,Okay.,"Remember, you guys.",No jokes.,No comments.,Nothing but support.,He needs a lot of support.,Tom.,Talking about a bra for a man.,"Okay, seriously.",That was the last one.,"So, as we know, Spring Hunting Season is upon us.","Uh, anyway, here's the info about the new licensing system.",Um Jerry?,I don't I don't think your computer is plugged in.,"I'm sorry, guys.",Just got to power up.,First thing we should have is my graph about the season.,What?,Wait a minute.,No.,That is not the graph.,That's a picture from my vacation to Muncie.,"You went on a vacation and you chose Muncie, Indiana?",Yeah.,My wife and I have a timeshare.,In Muncie?,"Tom, Muncie is a lovely city.","Anyway, Hunting and Fishing Season is winding down.",Okay?,"And we all know that it's already closed season on ""twout.",""" So, now I said ""twout"" instead of ""trout.",""" It happens to everyone.",My marbles are full of mouth today.,You know what?,Has anybody seen my glasses?,"I don't even think I can It says here ""1:00 meeting.",""" And who are we meeting with?",Don't worry about it.,"Oh, no.","Please, no.","Tom, it's important to meet with the Park Rangers.",They are the first line of defense.,Leslie Knope!,"Hey, Carl.","What's up, pencil pushers?",Haverford.,"Good to see you, man.",Is it hot in here?,I feel hot.,Are you guys hot?,How you guys doing?,I'm good.,You guys got any snacks?,Carl is the head of all outdoor security.,"Why was he transferred from his indoor desk job, you ask.",Listen.,"Hey, Leslie.",Have you seen Avatar?,I never saw Avatar.,"I wanted to read the book first, but then I realized there's no book version of Avatar.",What did you guys do for St.,Patty's Day?,"I was wearing this tshirt that said ""Kiss me, I'm Irish.",""" But no one would kiss me.",So.,You're too important for me until one of your own gets attacked.,I just feel like there's more we can do to keep the parks safe.,"Oh, you think you know how to do my job?","Well, you might not be so confident once you've walked a mile in my size sevens.",Kind of small feet.,"Actually, seven is the worldwide average.",Boom!,Welcome to the emergency selfdefense class.,"I'll be showing you how to escape from a variety of situations, while inflicting maximum damage on your attackers.","Ron, do you think that maybe I should put Mark in a headlock?","That way, I can show everyone how to escape a pervert?","In the scenario you just laid out, you're the pervert.","You understand that, right?",You wish.,Enough.,"I'm going to start off simple, and demonstrate how to extract oneself from a wrist grab.",Andy.,Ann.,Step up here.,I watch a lot of Lifetime movies.,"There was this one, How Far is Too Far Enough: The Teri Palliber Lonergan Story.","This woman had agoraphobia and her therapist was obsessed with her, and he hid in her house.",And then he attacked her and tried to eat her toes.,"Also, her daughter was having sex way too young.","So, yeah.",Free selfdefense class?,I'm there.,And then just twist away.,Very good.,Very good.,Well done.,Oh!,"What's up now, mugger?","Ann, that was awesome.",That was really good.,"I don't know, Leslie.",I'd rather be back at the office.,"I know this is painful for you, Jerry, but you have to be strong.",You guys ready?,"Oh, boy.","Yeah, okay.",We're ready.,I'm going to show you guys all the problems we've been facing.,I'm going to show you that we've been doing everything we can.,"Well, I'm looking forward to working together, Carl.","And after that, I'm going to show you this log I found.","It's got, like, fifty worms on it.","I call it ""worm log.",""" Yeah, I've always been a bit of an outdoorsman.","When I was a kid, my parents used to make me hang out in the backyard a lot and just run around until I got tired.","But if there's any criminals out there watching, I never get tired.","And ladies, too.",This thing is a mess.,"We used to have three carts, actually.",The first one got pushed into the creek by some kids.,"The second one, raccoons got onto.",There was urine everywhere.,And the third one was recently stolen.,What's this one?,This is the second one.,The raccoon piss one.,All right.,So we're going to just head out.,"Oh, no.",You know what?,I think we've got too much weight.,Oh.,"That's Tom, probably.",Are you serious?,"Tom, can you get off, please?","Just run alongside the cart, okay?",Okay.,Here we go.,Whoa!,"So, I want to tell you a little bit about the park.",Up here on the left is one of our most beautiful grass fields.,It's primarily grass.,"All right, I'm going to make a hard left here.","Stick with us, Tom.",Okay.,Lesson learned.,Thank you.,Next.,Andy.,Impressive.,"I'm going to engage Andy in an attack hold, and he's going to try and break free.",Cool.,"Now, I don't want to hurt you, Ron.",Don't worry about that.,Just try to escape my attack.,"Now, when I get out, am I allowed to counterstrike?",Sure.,"When you get out, you may counterattack.","But just promise me you'll be ready, because, I mean, I don't want to destroy you.",Okay.,"I see where we're going with this Now, when your arms are pinned to your sides, use your legs to break free, instead of your neck, which is what Andy is trying to do.","Okay, hold up.",Get off!,Let him go.,Andy.,"Oh, God.",Oops.,Any of this looking familiar?,Yeah.,It happened right over there.,"Oh, yeah.",I'm not surprised.,Take a look at this path.,"With budget cuts, we can't afford a single safety light.",There's been 10 assaults already this year.,Wow.,Really?,Can't you station a Park Ranger out here?,We have!,Who do you think they're assaulting?,I'm sorry.,I didn't mean to yell.,"One way or another, I'm going to get money so you can protect Jerry, and all the other helpless, pathetic people in this town.",You guys have got to slow down.,Can I just take a rest for a minute?,"No, Tom.",Sorry.,No can do.,Sun's going down and it's real dangerous out here.,"Let's roll, Carl.",Okay.,Going fast.,"Okay, what day is it today?",I don't know.,"Okay, but to be fair, you never know.",That's kind of true.,I'm super bad at days.,"But honestly, I'm fine.","Sorry I squeezed your lights out there, son.",No worries.,"Will you show me how to do that move, though?",Sure.,"I can teach you right now No, no, no.","Andy, you should really just take it easy, I think.",Do you want some more water?,Or maybe some pancakes?,No.,"No, I'm fine.",Thank you.,What is the first move in any fight?,Punch to the balls.,We've all heard the old saying.,"""Parks are supposed to be fun.",""" But sometimes, muggers have their own ideas.",Leslie Knope is with us again from the Parks Department.,"Leslie, tell us your story.","This is my coworker, Jerry Gergich.",Diabetic.,Sloppily out of shape.,Friend.,He was mugged this morning in Ramsett Park.,Who's next?,Your frumpy uncle?,Your simple neighbor?,Your unpopular coworker?,"Head of security, Carl Lorthner, is doing his best to keep the parks safe, but he's failing.","So, what is the solution to fix this?",To make it right.,And not bad.,We need money from City Hall.,And it's not coming through.,"And Pawnee, I am sorry to say this, but your government is failing you.","Up next, 10 objects you didn't know you can eat.",What possessed you to do that?,"I'm sorry, Paul, but one of my guys got mugged in the park.",I don't care how upset you are.,You do not badmouth your own government on TV.,I'm sure you'll be happy to know your little stunt worked.,The Mayor is going to divert $2500 to the Parks for security upgrades.,There's going to be an announcement tomorrow at 10:00 in the press room.,So Make sure you bring the doofus who got his ass kicked.,I don't know who you're referring to.,We treat everyone with respect around here.,Okay.,Good morning.,"As many of you know, there was an incident involving a government employee in Ramsett Park.","Jerry, are you nervous?",Just talk about how hard it was for you.,Speak from the heart.,You'll be fine.,Leslie?,I wasn't mugged.,safety of our citizens.,That's why we're here today to give Pawnee Jerry?,Why don't you step on up here?,"No, I will.",Get up here.,I'm going to speak for Jerry.,He can't talk right now because he has hysterical muteness from trauma.,Correct.,Jerry.,What about this?,Is this fake?,Huh?,Is this fake?,This is real.,I really dislocated my shoulder.,Were you even in the park yesterday?," Look, I was on my way to feed the hummingbirds, and I stopped for a breakfast burrito.", The farting., Yeah.," And Lord Sheldon He lunged at a bird, I dropped the burrito, and it landed on a log in the creek."," So, I go to reach for it, I lose my balance, and I fall on my shoulder really weird."," Well, why didn't you just tell everybody the truth? Are you kidding me? Imagine what Tom would have said."," Damn, Jerry! You jumped in a creek for a burrito? What would you do for a Klondike Bar? Kill your wife? Block the opponent's punch and counter-punch to the jaw.", Shoeshine? Hey.," Oh! Hey! Ann Perkins, in the ""shoe-shouse.",""" I wanted to check in.", I brought some stuff from the hospital.," Water, a compress, aspirin, some lollipops, I know you love those."," Ann, you know, thank you."," But really, I'm feeling great.", I took a couple of aspirin and slept right through the night., And Hold on a second., Ludgate., What the hell? I got you one of those veggie muffins that you're always eating., Score., Yeah., It tastes like a rug., Shut up., Don't hit me., Good.," Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.", I am., Thank you for that., That's so cool.," Since when did he start doing stuff for other people? Now, I actually am worried that something happened to his brain."," People change, I guess Wouldn't you rather the money go to keeping the parks safe? Yes, but now, we have the money under false pretenses.", I actually think that you have a bigger problem than the money.," What? There is someone in your department who is willing to lie about being mugged, because he's afraid of his co-workers.", Knope., Yep., No., Carl.," What are you doing? Oh, Leslie."," Well, since you decided to drag my name through the mud on TV, I figured why not return the favor."," Carl, could you quietly quiet down for a second, and please tell me what is going on, quietly? Okay? In a quiet voice.", A citizen handed in a very interesting home video that I think the people of Pawnee will find very interesting., Take a peek at this., Keep your eyes on the creek., There he is., This is my favorite part., Not willing to share with a dog.," So, it would appear that Park Security was not to blame after all."," Okay, look.", I have a proposition for you., Fine., I'll have sex with you in exchange for the tape., That's not what I am saying., Okay? Just listen to what I have to say., The Ramsett Park mugging story continues with a shiny new twist., Ranger Carl Lorthner is here today.," Now, I understand that you have a bombshell to drop that you are just sitting on."," Yes, that's correct.", I came on today because I have some very important information to share., I finally saw Avatar and I thought it lived up to the hype.," Well, I'm not sure what that has to do with the mugging.", Uh Leslie., Counterpoint., I disagree with Carl., Okay.," I have seen Avatar as well, and I think it exceeded the hype."," What? Oh boy, we Disagreement."," Well, things are really heating up in here, aren't they? We should probably take some calls.", That segment was a disaster., Don't you ever me like that again., This is Pawnee Today.," Do you know that I bumped a cat that can stand up on its hinders for you? You disgust me, Knope.", Get out of my sight.," Yes, ma'am.", Go., Go on.," Oh, no, no, no.", Don't make me chase you., You want to go eat something? Okay., I am part of a great team.," And sometimes, the best way to maintain a strong team is just by letting someone know that he is still a part of it."," This is the only copy, and I am going to destroy it.", Right after I watch it one more time.," I'm sorry, but it is so good."," Hey, Jerry.", Hmm., I got you a peppermint latte., Seriously? My goodness., I love a peppermint I know.," Oh, geez.", Go ahead., We should just directly apply the food to your clothes., Making fun of Jerry is back! They can laugh at me all they want., Because two more years until I retire with full benefits and pension.," And the wife and I, we have bought a little cottage on a lake."," And I am going to get myself a stack of mystery novels, a box of cigars, and I am going to sit back and enjoy my life."," Hey, Jerry? April was just double-checking the lunch order."," Do you want the salmon or the ""twout""? Twout! Twout! Twout! Twout!   ","
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 20,Good morning.,Whoo!,Swiss Family Ronbinson!,That hat is dope.,"Thanks, Tom.",You mind if I rock that bad Larry on my dome?,Wear it on my head?,Try it on the ladies?,Be my guest.,"Hi, I'm Tom.",I have a raccoon on my head.,Excuse me?,My friend over here was digging through your trash and I think we may have a lot in common.,I'm Tom.,Would you like to see a movie sometime?,Are you a raccoon?,Because you've been running around my hat all day Head all day.,"Girl, you're more precious than Precious.",Uhuh.,"""Nice hat.",Wanna bone?,""" That's you, talking to me.",No.,"How about, ""Yes, I am a hunter, and it's you season.",""" Whoa, that's great.",I gotta get back out there.,"You know what they say, animal on the head, manimal in the bed.","Damn, girl!",Your hotness killed my raccoon!,I have a raccoon hat.,I'm an interesting person.,Hello!,Any luck?,Nope.,Didn't work out as well as I thought it would.,"Well, better luck next time.",I tried.,It just didn't seem like Wow.,I love that hat.,"Thank you, ma'am.","Hey, Ron.",I have a surprise for you.,Meet me at Harvey James Park at 11:30.,Why?,It's a surprise!,What's the surprise?,"If I told you, it would ruin the surprise.",What's the surprise it would ruin?,I cannot tell you that.,"Leslie, my first wife, Tammy, tried throwing me a surprise birthday party.","When I saw my friends hiding through the window, I drove to a gas station, called the cops and told them people had broken into my home.",I'm not big on surprises.,"Okay, but you're gonna like this one.",What is it?,I'm not telling you.,And I'm not gonna tell anybody!,Okay.,I'll tell you.,We're putting together the Parks Department Summer Catalog.,"And the big surprise is I am going to reunite all the living former Parks Directors at a picnic, record the whole thing, and then write about it in the ""Welcome Letter.",""" It's the biggest catalog of the year.",Think of the September issue of Vogue.,But it's more important to Pawnee.,Mainly because we don't get Vogue here.,"I'm gonna move this ""Yearning"" ad to the centerfold.","Centerfold, always the best part.","Am I right, Justin?","Damn, they broke up six weeks ago.",Yeah.,"Jerry, I need to see your softball pictures.","Here you go, Chief.","Wow, good job.",Nice work.,Whoa!,Wait a minute.,Isn't that that creepy guy?,Morgan?,The pedophile?,"Yeah, it is.","Oh, my God.","Oh, Jerry!",Come on!,I didn't know that!,He seemed okay.,We had dinner together.,"Guys, I don't know if I made it clear, but I don't want any sex offenders in our Parks catalog.","Okay, I will Photoshop his face.","Can you Photoshop your life with better decisions, Jerry?","Okay, April.",Enough.,Cover photo.,"Tom, you're up.","This catalog is basically, like, an ad for the Parks Department, and I love ads.","I love magazine ads for flavored vodkas, billboards for designer jeans.",I TiVo through shows to get to the ads.,I love ads.,What are we trying to do with this catalog?,We're trying to sell Pawnee on our summer classes.,How do we do that?,"With one perfect, captivating image.",April?,Modern life.,Where are we running?,"Sometimes, what we want is not always where we are.",Next slide.,Are we alone?,Is the real winter inside our hearts?,We are all struggling for definition in a world that resists our inquiries.,"Okay, this isn't gonna work for a number of reasons.","One, this is a summer catalog.","Two, that was complete gibberish.","And three, that child looks like it's abandoned.","So, basically, boo.",Next slide.,"Oh, God.",Weird.,How did that That's a personal photo.,"That's Shouldn't be This must've You know, I gotta say, I think that could actually work as our cover photo.","I'm cool with it, if you guys are.",It's a highres photo.,"I don't know if I have time for this, guys, so, let's just pick a good photo, okay?","What do you want, Leslie?",A picture of parents pushing a kid on a swing?,Yeah.,Exactly.,Get me that.,Okay.,I gotta go.,What is he thinking?,"""Why is my cup so tiny?",""" Hey.",What are you doing here?,Happy sixmonth anniversary.,I got you a gift.,It's a chicken salad sandwich.,"And I don't want you to feel bad about not getting me anything, because I would never expect Swiss Army Watch, mofo.",Well done.,Perkins.,Wow!,You like it?,Thank you so much.,That's so nice.,Are you allowed to kiss me in a hospital room?,"Oh, don't worry about it.",He's dead.,"Oh, my God.","Oh, no, I'm just kidding, he's sleeping.","Oh, okay.","Yeah, our relationship is going well.",Really well.,That guy really seemed dead.,Nice!,"Here, catch this.",You got me in the face!,Oh!,That one hurt.,You've a good arm.,I know.,I used to play softball in high school.,Shut up!,I played baseball in high school.,Shut up!,"Yeah, that's like, the boy version of softball.","Guys, don't play with the food, okay?",We need this for the picnic.,Do we have everything?,"Yes, ma'am.","Three picnic baskets, assorted cheeses, grapes, wine.",Smoked salmon?,April threw the smoked salmon on the roof.,I'm sorry.,Where's Leslie?,She just texted me from your phone and said she left her phone at home and that I should come here immediately.,And why did I believe that?,"Maybe in your heart you knew it was from me, but you came anyway.",Nope.,"Tom, would you please stop texting me that you're having a city planning emergency?",There's no such thing as a city planning emergency.,"Hi, there.",Hi.,Look at you two.,"Ann Perkins, Mark Brendanawicz.","""Anndanawicz.",""" Or ""Merkins.",""" No, ""Anndanawicz.",""" You two should be models.",Maybe on the cover of the Parks Department Summer Catalog?,"That's not the reason you called me in here, right?",'Cause I just finished a 12hour shift.,"If that's the reason Come on, Ann.",It'd be a huge favor for Leslie.,You know how important this is to her.,"Well, I am in.",Dude!,I am.,We don't have any pictures of just the two of us.,"Plus, I've always said we should go on more dates with Tom.","Yeah, you have.",And thank God an opportunity presented itself.,See?,Winwin.,"Now, Ann, you're gonna change, right?",I guess.,Would it kill you to maybe put on some lipstick?,Do you even own lipstick?,This is probably the first time in history these four great men have been in the same place at the same time.,It kind of makes you What is this?,Sweater swap!,She noticed!,You were right.,"Oh, my God.",Somebody's here.,Okay.,"Guys, just act normal.",Please?,Just be like normal people.,Hello!,Hi!,David Moser!,I'm Leslie Knope.,It is such an honor to meet you.,Right.,How long is this gonna take?,"Oh, not very long.","I realize, of course, you're a very busy man.",I love parks.,I don't know if that's something I've communicated before.,"So, having a picnic with all the former living Parks Department Directors Guess who just checked something off her bucket list?","Clarence Carrington, David Moser, Michael Tansley, Ron Swanson, gathered together on a beautiful day in this beautiful park.",I think we should just take a moment and appreciate how lucky we are.,"I thought you were dead, Clarence.",No.,"I'm gonna outlive you, then I'm gonna nail your wife.","Screw you, you old coot.",Classic David.,You're worse than Ron.,"Shut your damn mouth, Tansley.",Okay!,Great!,Let's go!,"When I say ""parks,"" you say ""department!",""" Parks!",Parks!,Apartment!,"Oh, boy.",This is taking a lot longer than I thought it would.,Can you guys run up ahead and set up the picnic?,Sure.,Oh.,Where are they going with the food?,I'm starving.,I only had one breakfast.,"Okay, relax.","Look, what was going on back there?",Why all the sniping?,Not exactly sure.,"The only one I know is Michael, and we're not exactly best friends.",Hmm.,I'm hungry.,"Okay, well, don't be such a baby.",I cooked you some bacon for a trail snack.,I ate it already.,What?,I could smell it in your purse before I even parked my car.,And now it's gone.,And I hate everything.,"Good, good, good.",All right.,I think we got the boring clichd shot that Leslie wanted.,That's it?,We're done?,Not even close.,Now the real art begins.,"Step one, nail this photo shoot with an amazing, iconic image.","Step two, book some outside gigs.","Step three, have sex with a model.","Step four, step in front of the camera, become a model.","Go, yes!",Keep slithering!,Keep slithering!,"Ann, can you give me something, anything, in the face?",What do you want me to do?,Do what Mark's doing.,He's doing great!,Keep slithering!,"I'm not doing anything, so Okay, Clarence, um, why don't you describe the first Summer Pawnee Catalog.",I remember.,That first year we offered four classes.,I actually taught Homemaking.,Women were not allowed to teach back then.,Really?,I thought there were female teachers way before then.,Not in my department.,"Well, times have changed.","I'm Deputy Director now, but I'm hoping someday to be the first female director of the department.","Oh, I don't think that's a good idea.","Women need a lot of blood to flow through to their baby centers, which leaves less to the brain, you see.",Yeah.,Mmmhmm.,Sure.,"I'd stay away from leadership roles, for your own safety.",No!,No!,Maybe I should write a song about a picnic.,"Ooh, where'd you come up with that idea?",The picnic we're having.,"I already have the perfect title, Life is a Picnic.",That's good.,How about Life is a Picnic with You?,Whoa!,Then it could be about a girl.,Or Peyton Manning!,Hmm.,You wanna help me write the lyrics?,"Yeah, totally.",We should grab a drink after this at Tucker's.,"Yeah, I would do that.",That sounds fun.,I just have to get my stuff from the office.,But that's That'd be cool.,"David, what was it exactly that called you to the Parks Department?","Well, I was in Public Works for eight years.",But the director was pretty young.,Clarence was old and weak.,"So, I put in for a transfer, swooped in and pushed him out.",There was no other reason you wanted the job?,No.,Just the money and the pension.,The actual job's a nightmare.,"I mean, who gives a crap about this crap.","Well, David, I think we've talked enough.","Mark, that's great.","Bobby, great.","Ann, you look miserable!",Terrible.,Terrible!,"Come on, Ann.",What are we doing?,Maxim or Good Housekeeping?,I'm not sure which one is the insult.,"Hey, if there's anyone out there that's doing a photo shoot about the dangers of eating undercooked chicken, I can give you Ann's phone number.","Okay, let's stop for a second.","Bobby, I love how you work.",Yay!,You can have as many juice boxes as you want.,"In fact, grab me one, too.",Make it an apple.,"Mark, great job, you can have a juice box, too.","Ann, take a walk with me.","In a million years, I never thought you would be the problem with this photo shoot.","Didn't you just plan this, like, two hours ago?",I just don't get it.,How could someone so hot be so bad at looking hot?,I'm sorry I'm not a professional model.,"And screaming, ""Make your face better!",""" doesn't help.","Well, I'm sorry, your face just isn't working.",And we need to do something to distract from this boring area.,"Now, I didn't want to have to do this, but we may have to go nude.","Goodbye, Tom!",Fair enough.,I totally understand.,But we should get one for safety.,"Okay, guys.",We're almost there.,It's right up here.,You really shouldn't be leading us.,"If you're menstruating, you'll attract bears.",Holy God.,Okay.,Here we are.,Eat.,"Well, it hasn't gone exactly as I've hoped.",But I got them all here and we're gonna have a beautiful picnic.,It's gonna It's gonna be good.,Hey.,I just whizzed on a butterfly!,"Well, gentlemen, as you know, I'm working on my welcome letter for the Summer Catalog.",You should just copy the Eagleton one.,I used to just copy the Eagleton one.,Did you?,I was hoping that maybe you could talk to me a little bit about how the department has changed since you ran it.,"Well, I think you've done a wonderful job maintaining the parks.","Thank you, Michael.",I appreciate that.,Did you enjoy your turn at the helm?,"Oh, in a way.","Pencil pushing wasn't really my thing, but I did love the parks themselves.",That was the best part of the job.,"Oh, isn't it?",I totally agree.,"Well, thank goodness for you.","Yes, thank goodness for Michael.","Are you still on parole, by the way?","Oh, ha, ha.","Very funny, Ron.",Yes.,"Yes, Ron, I am.",What?,He smoked pot.,In the office.,And in all the parks.,Constantly.,"In fairness to me, it was a different time.",It was the early '90s.,"But also, it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal.",Thomas Jefferson grew hemp.,"Alcohol is legal, but pot isn't?","That makes sense to you, Ron?","I'm sorry, I can't hear hippies.","So, if you had to sleep with one of the old guys, who would it be?",The superold one.,Really?,Mmmhmm.,I'm an eyebrow girl.,I wanna make out with him and chew his eyebrows off.,That is really gross.,Anybody got any water?,I want water.,"I'm so old, I need to drink water.","Oh, stop it, stop taunting him.","I don't need your help, jailbird.","If there's any unclaimed meat or cheese, I would like to claim it.",Yeah.,Like you claimed my job?,Yes.,"Exactly like that, in that I wanted it, and then I took it.","Okay, guys, you know what I would love?","I would love if anybody just said something positive about, oh, I don't know, anything.",I agree.,"Let's just relax, smoke another J, and all calm down.",Another?,"By the way, it's ridiculous that pot is illegal.",It grows in the ground!,"I've planted marijuana in community gardens all over the city, and it hasn't hurt anyone!",What?,"You know, Michael?",You are one potloving mother pain in the rectum.,"Okay, stop it!",Stop it!,"You're all being awful, horrible men!", Uhoh.," Your little friend come to visit? Clarence, if you mention anything about women, or menstruation, or anything, I'm gonna take your face and I'm gonna shove it in those brambles."," Yes! No! You're next, buddy.", Andy! Let's take this picture.," Come on! Get out of your seats, turds.", What? Line up over there., Come on., Just please try to look human.," All right, and not so evil.", Everybody looking here.," One, two, three.", Thank you so much for the wonderful memories., Everybody take their stuff and go.," Ooh, ooh, ooh.", Can we do one funny-face one? Do you have that picture that Andy took? Maybe I'll run it without any text., Yeah., I tried to Photoshop it to make it look like they were happy., It was really hard., Their mouths are so old., God! Look at these horrible men.," You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog."," Would you like these men in your catalog? Oh, my God, April.", That's disgusting., What? Look how generous they're being with each other.," And here's the ""Obstruction"" series."," What do you think? Amazing, right? I call this one ""The Future.",""" It's completely blurry."," Yes, it is, Ann."," What about the ones we took on the swing? The normal ones? You mean the ""Unhappy Wife"" photos? Oh, my God."," These are even worse, somehow.", I look miserable., You do look kind of miserable.," Now you know what I meant by, ""Make your face better.",""" Was there something wrong, Ann? Well, I had just gotten off a long shift.", He was being really annoying., Mark looks happy.," Just please don't use these, okay? Let's grab some dinner.", Sure.," Hey, Ron.", You want me to read you what I have so far in my welcome letter? Nothing., Because you and your jerk predecessors didn't give me anything to work with., Did you print this out? I heard the printer going., Yes., You could've just handed me a blank piece of paper., Oh! Wisdom! Finally., Thank you so much., You can also keep the photo., Thanks for the memories., Good God., I don't remember this., That That's the wrong one., But the real one's very bad as well.," I want you to know that I'm replacing the ""Welcome Letter"" with this ad for Yearning by Dennis Feinstein."," So goodbye, distilled wisdom of 50 years of experience."," Hello, disgusting fragrance flap.", Let me buy you dinner., No., I insist you buy me dinner., Get a drink., Whatever., It's cool., ANDY: Okay., ID., I'm 24.," No, you're not."," Okay, I'm 25."," No old jokes, please.", ID., It says right here you're 20., You're not even gonna show me a fake? Sometimes the confidence confuses people.," You're good, bro."," You know what? I think I'll just I'm gonna Hey, I know another bar that always lets me in, if you just wanna go there."," Uh Yeah, actually, I should get going home.", I have a lot of stuff to do.," So, I should go home.", Clean and stuff.," But Yeah, okay, cool."," Yeah, I gotta go home, too.", So All right., See you! Later.," The usual, Marta."," Me, too, Marta.", You got it.," Oh, Ron, I really made love to the pooch on this one.", Screwed the pooch? I don't like that term., It's so vulgar.," Ron! That sucked, today.", I'm sorry., There's no other way to say it., They're a bunch of career bureaucrats.," What did you think they were gonna say to you? ""Leslie, you are the next link in a wonderful chain ""that stretches back to when our town was founded, ""and we believe in you and we support you ""and we'll be following your career."," ""You are the chosen one.",""" Or something."," Well, okay, so, that was the problem.", No., You know what the worst part is is I wanna be Parks Director., But every single person who was Parks Director hated their job and hated everyone they worked with., Are we gonna hate each other someday? I don't think so., I think we're gonna be fine.," Anyway, the point's moot, because you're Park Director now and you're not going anywhere and I'm not making you go anywhere."," I'm not gonna stab you in the back or anything, so Maybe I should go somewhere."," Maybe I should move, to Eagleton."," Oh, God, the thought of that."," Leslie, you don't have to move to Eagleton."," When I become City Manager, my job is yours."," Of course, my first act as City Manager will be to propose eliminating the Parks Department.", Although I expect a spirited debate with Leslie., Who knows what the future holds for me? Maybe I'll leapfrog Ron's job and become City Manager.," Of course, my first act as City Manager would be to double the size of the Parks Department."," Although, I do expect a fight from Ron.", But I'll win.," Mmm! Thank you, darling."," Why would anybody ever eat anything besides breakfast food? People are idiots, Leslie."," The wait is over! Oh, yeah! Yeah! Look what's here."," We got ""My fellow Pawneeans Yes, it's here! ""The Parks Department's Summer Catalog has arrived ""and for the first time in 20 years, tennis is back! ""Peruse this wondrous book at your leisure ""and take advantage of everything this great town has to offer."," ""Time is fleeting, my fellow Pawneeans."," ""Make the most of it, while you can."," ""I recently had the honor of spending an afternoon ""with every living former Parks Director, ""and they taught me a valuable lesson, ""there is nothing more important than friendship.",""" It's a little flowery.", Shut up., I gotta hand it to Michael., His water-pipe-making skills were most impressive., I once saw him smoke pot out of a 20-foot length of garden hose and a milk jug., That guy made a water pipe out of a stuffed raccoon., No way.," No, I'm not kidding.", He made a bong out of a taxidermied raccoon? I caught him smoking pot out of it not three feet from where we're standing.," Oh, nice shot.", Right in Clarence's ancient junk., In the neck!   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 21,"Leslie, can I run something by you really quick?",Sure!,I love having things run by me.,I feel like you're being sarcastic right now.,"No, no.",I'm not.,I genuinely love it.,Run it by me.,Go ahead!,"Go, go, go.","Okay, so I've been a little worried that Ann maybe thinks that our relationship isn't moving forward fast enough.",And so I'm wondering if maybe I should ask her if she would like to move in with me.,Good idea?,Bad idea?,You tell me.,"I would say that some women won't consider moving in with someone unless they think marriage is in the future, which I know, for you is I intend to marry her.",For realskies?,I'm not really quite sure how I feel.,I It's a little weird.,"I mean, I'm happy for them.",They're my friends.,It makes me a little nauseous.,"If I could just sum it up in one word, it would be Parks and Rec.",Confirming what?,That's not possible.,"Oh, no!",Hey!,Good morning.,Why are there six people outside who say they're waiting to meet with me?,"So, you know how you love me because you haven't had a single meeting with anyone since I became your assistant?","That's because every time someone calls and requests a meeting with you, I always schedule it for March 31st.",Why?,Because I didn't think March 31st existed.,"Thirty days has September, April, March and November June and November.",Today is March 31st.,I know.,"So, then, how many meetings do I have today?",Ninetythree.,Okay.,Okay.,"Well, you know what to do.",Right.,"To me, this situation is a bloodsoaked, nightmarish hellscape.","However, to Leslie Knope Oh, how fun!",Yay!,"Why don't you take as many as you can, and I'll cover the rest.",I have a better idea.,"Why don't I try to rustle up seven more meetings, 'cause I think it would be cooler if there were an even 100 Just Why don't we just stick to these 93 and see how it goes?","Yeah, okay.",This is the perfect distraction for me.,"Okay, so I have everything I need, right?","I have a fresh cup of coffee, comfy furlined boots.",I'm gonna need those boots back by the end of the day.,"Yeah, no problem.",They're actually a little narrow for me.,"Leslie, here's a guy.","Hi, I'm Leslie Knope, Deputy Director.","Bill Haggerty, Pawnee Historical Society.",I'm supposed to be meeting with Ron Swanson.,I understand that.,He's tied up right now.,What a shocker.,"I've been trying to meet with him for three months, and now he's not available.","It's probably too late now, but, some rich woman, Jessica Wicks, has rented out Turnbill Mansion for a party, and she's making alterations.","""Alterations""?",Turnbill Mansion is one of the most beloved historical sites in Pawnee.,"In 1867, the progressive Reverend Turnbill officiated a wedding between a white woman and a Wamapoke Indian chief.",The secret ceremony was beautiful and romantic.,"But then word got out, and the reception was a bloodbath.","Fortunately, there were two survivors.","Unfortunately, they were both horses.",Hold up.,Former beauty queen Jessica Wicks?,Yes.,I'm Tom Haverford.,"I'm gonna be running point on this, Bill.","Hey, why didn't you try to stop her?",Her husband is Nick Newport Sr.,From Sweetums.,Everyone in this town is afraid to say no to him.,"Okay, everybody just relax.",What alterations is she trying to make?,"Drilling holes, painting, removing wainscoting, she's tearing down the gazebo What?",She's what?,"No, she's not.",Okay.,"Tom, go get the car.",Ow!,Sorry.,Don't throw things at me.,"God, these are tight!",I'll devise an action plan to help us coordinate better among the departments.,Will you?,Great.,Thanks for coming in.,Yeah.,Who's next?,"Tom, I'll meet you at the car.",Where the hell are you going?,We have 91 more meetings!,"I'm sorry, Ron, as much as I would like to go for the ""alltime City Hall single day meetings record,"" there is an emergency.",Someone is trying to alter a gazebo.,Hey.,"Oh, hey, Ann.",Sorry I can't hang out.,I kind of have an emergency.,"Oh, I'm actually here to see Mark.",Right.,"Well, thanks for the coffee.",That's also for Mark.,"I really need it, though.","But next time more sugar, okay?","Thanks, bye.",Do you want me to postpone the rest?,Or I could set myself on fire and create a diversion?,No.,I'm gonna do all of these today.,Round up whoever's free.,I'm gonna need more Ron Swansons.,Look at that.,It's gorgeous.,What kind of monster would wanna change this?,Prezit.,Do you have any brown concealer by any chance?,I need to look good for Jessica.,"You know, they may be rich, but they can't just destroy history.",Let's go.,I'm right behind you.,I just need to spend a minute in my cologne cloud.,What is that?,Attack by Dennis Feinstein.,When you wanna attack the senses of the lady you wanna bed.,"Oh, my God!",Door!,Door!,"Door, door!",Close it!,"So basically, we're completely swamped.",All hands on deck.,I don't even work in this building.,Don't care.,I need anyone with a pulse and a brain to pitch in.,"Ron, do you need help with anything?","No, we're good.",Thanks.,"In fact, you can head home early.","Right, now the four of us are gonna divvy up all these meetings.",Just make them feel like they've been heard.,Understood?,"Yes, sir.","Bert Macklin, FBI, on the case.","April, you take Leslie's office.","Andy, you're in the conference room.","Ann, take your meetings in the courtyard.",Just sit there and don't ruin the city.,Dismissed.,What are you doing?,Can I get a badge?,"Hey, I brought you a coffee, help you get through the day.","Thanks, dude!","No problem, lady!",I'm gonna go.,Okay.,April is the best but she's 20.,"When April was born, I was already in third grade, which means if we were friends back then, I'd have been hanging out with a baby.",I don't know anything about infant care.,"My God, I could have killed her!","Ah, Mr.",Newport Sr.,I've just been informed that you plan on altering this mansion.,"And as a member of the Parks Department, as a Pawneean and an American, I ask you to refrain from harming this historic structure.",What?,"I'll take care of this, love nut.",Biscuit.,Yeah.,"Hi, I'm Jessica Wicks, Miss Pawnee 1994.","Hello, yes.",We've met before.,We were both judges at the pageant last year.,Leslie Knorp.,Of course!,How are you?,Jessica Wicks.,"Hey, boo!",Are you aging in reverse?,'Cause you look barely legal.,Tom Haverford.,If you're not the most charming man in Indiana.,And this must be the luckiest man in Indiana.,"Sir, it is an honor to meet you.","Come here, you!","Tell me straight, are you a Chinese?",No!,I'm one of the Indian people.,That floppy old bag of money is gonna be dead in like a month.,And who's going to comfort Jessica and her millions of dollars?,"Yeah, Jessica is a golddigger.",But I'm a golddiggerdigger.,"So, how did you and Mr.",Newport meet?,"I was doing a ribboncutting at the hospital, and he was there because his blood doesn't work.","And we started talking, and then I realized who he was.","Oh, my gosh!",It was love at first sight!,"Oh, that sounds so romantic.","Um, Jessica, I know you've rented out this house for a party.","But it's on the historical register, so we can't allow any changes.",I'm so sorry.,"It's a little late for that, sweetheart.",I told them what I was doing months ago.,"Where I come from, there's a saying, ""What's done is done.",""" That's a saying everywhere.",I've never heard it before and I think it's a great saying.,"Well, maybe we can just limit the damage.",How much have you done?,You painted this?,Uhhuh.,Miami Teal is Nicky's favorite color.,"We also replaced some of the sconces, got rid of the furniture, painted these floors black Oh, no.",These were the original hardwood floors.,Yeah.,They were all scratched up.,I did you a favor.,Come on in here.,I'll show you guys what we did in the sitting room.,I can't After you.,I'd hate to miss the view.,You little devil.,I should just pay you to follow me around.,"If that's a job offer, I accept.","Oh, my God!",Why did you have to drill holes in the wall?,To hang my birthday present to Nicky.,My heavens!,"Isn't there a way that you could've Oh, my!",History is important.,You just can't go around changing everything all of the time.,"Or else next thing you know, they'll be painting the White House not white.","I'm so angry, I can't think of another color.",Green.,"So, your department banned me from attending games just because I yell ""you suck"" at the players!","According to the complaint, you yelled it at fiveyearold girls.",Who suck!,Why is that so hard to understand?,I thought I was having this meeting with Ron Swanson.,I'm afraid that Ron Swanson's currently dead.,Oh.,"I'm his daughter, April Swanson.",And it's his last wish that I have this meeting with you.,I represent the Ultimate Frisbee league.,And Pawnee has an Ultimate league?,"Yes, and we keep running into conflicts with You won me over.",I will join your team.,"I'm sorry, what we need When does practice start?",And do you provide the jerseys?,"What color are the jerseys, by the way?",What's our team name?,Are we the Lightning?,"Now, I have to tell you, I don't actually work in the Parks Department.",I'm a nurse.,Seriously?,That's great news.,I have the weirdest thing on my arm.,Can you see this?,Every time.,"Oh, thank God you haven't torn down the gazebo yet.",Don't remind me.,The demolition people couldn't get here until this afternoon.,I've had to look at that ugly thing all day long.,Ugly thing?,"Let me tell you a little something about this ""ugly thing,"" ma'am.","A hundred and fifty years ago, an interracial couple was married here, and then slaughtered by their own families.",It's one of the most beautiful stories in Pawnee's history.,Why are you trying to destroy it?,Don't tell me about Pawnee history.,The Newports made this town.,"And tonight, we're gonna celebrate my husband's 85th birthday, without this mushy old pile of rot.",Your husband's a mushy old pile of rot.,"You were a stickinthemud when we judged that beauty pageant, and you're being a stickinthemud now.",I am not a stickinthemud!,I just want to stop a party from happening.,Ron?,"I have a gazebo update, so ignore all my previous voicemails and emails.","Leslie, I haven't relieved myself in five hours, so, if you'll excuse me.","Ron, I'm sorry, but this can't wait.","Jessica Wicks refuses to Leslie, what the Hey!",Miss Knope?,Councilman Howser!,Nice to see you again.,"Not that I saw anything, other than your face, and I would like to talk to you a little bit about this gazebo thing.","You know, the problem Okay, okay.",Enough of this.,Do whatever you want.,Alert the media.,"Call FEMA, I don't care.",Do not bother me with this again.,Miss Knope.,Councilman Howser.,I saw your penis.,There are eight swings at Ramsett Park and every single one of them is broken.,Can you please just fix one of them?,Ron told me I can't say yes to anything.,But it's such a reasonable request.,I can't just say no.,"So, that's a yes?",Are you saying yes?,"Just say out loud, yes or no.",Boop!,"Yeah, they do look a little bit swollen.",Just follow the pen.,Follow the pen to Does that hurt?,There's no way this ordinance goes through.,There's too much red tape.,Mmm.,This gridlock drives me nuts.,Tell me about it.,Yeah.,I think you're gonna have to make an end run.,You know?,Go right to the Commissioner on this one.,"You know what, I hadn't thought of that.",That is a really great idea.,Yeah?,I'm gonna do that.,Okay.,Your last resort is probably gonna be City Council.,Good luck there!,Yeah!,My thoughts exactly.,I have no idea what I was saying.,I ask you.,Is this too revealing for a public pool?,Kindly get your groin off my desk.,"So my body makes you uncomfortable, too?","Hey, Mark.",I'm kind of freaking out about this historical mansion thing.,Can I talk to you for a second?,I'm actually headed right out the door.,You're going on a date with Ann.,Yeah.,"I was gonna surprise her, take her to a nice restaurant.",Don't worry about it.,Are you sure now?,"Yeah, have a good time.",How we doing?,Pretty good.,I may have promised a new aquatic center to somebody.,Is that a problem?,I diagnosed two melanomas.,They're both benign.,How many more meetings?,Twenty.,April was supposed to be the moat that kept the citizen barbarians away from Swanson Castle.,Instead she blew up the castle and stabbed me in the face.,I hired you to do one thing.,Just one.,I don't care that you text all day and sleep at your desk.,"In fact, I encourage it.",But only because you were doing that one thing.,Keeping this crap off my desk.,Give me five minutes before the next one.,That guy is scary when he's angry.,Yeah!,"God, I know.",Hey.,"Sorry, dude.",I don't need your sympathy.,Or yours.,I wasn't offering my sympathy.,Thank you for meeting me here.,Sure.,What's up?,Okay.,I need you to get this word for word.,It's a tape recorder.,So it will.,"""Gazebo?",""" More like ""Gazoinksbo.",""" She may be a former beauty queen, but today she's the king of destroying history!","Okay, could you just maybe talk normally?","Okay, fine.","""Gazoinksbo.",""" Jessica Wicks is throwing a birthday party for her husband Nick Newport Sr.",At the Turnbill Mansion tonight Okay.,I'm gonna stop you right there.,Nick Newport Sr.,Is the former CEO of Sweetums.,So?,Sweetums owns The Pawnee Journal.,Crap on the cob!,I will take it into consideration.,Thank God!,"That was it, right?",No.,There's one more.,Damn it to hell!,It's with me and it's right now and it's about me quitting.,I quit.,"I have no other choice, okay?",This is the only rational way I know to prevent this tragedy.,"Oh, my God!",Here they come.,"Tom, throw away the key!",Seriously?,Yes!,Throw it!, Out of the way!," Sir, I'm sorry, but you're a little late."," So, you're gonna have to turn this thing around, 'cause you're not getting in here."," Oh, God! Tom! Stop him! Jump in front of it! Sacrifice your tiny body! I really thought that gate would open in the middle."," Well, the gazebo has been destroyed."," And the thing that bothers me the most Cut it out, Tom.", It never gets old.," Hey, Ann and Mark are coming."," Guys, not so close.", You're gonna You're gonna Don't go past the sensor., Sensor? Sorry if I ruined your evening.," Leslie, it's totally fine.", I chained myself to a gate., I can see that., Are you okay? Nothing's bruised but my ego.," And my arm, a little, from the mechanized gate.", Thanks again for letting me take those meetings today., I've never really had a meeting before., They're awesome., You're welcome.," Hey, have you seen April around? She usually comes by at the end of the day.", You might want to check her house., She quit on me., What? Why? She screwed up my entire life today., That was one mistake., She's perfect for you.," Come on, there's no one in the world who's gonna do a better job for you than April.", Either you hire her back or I quit., You don't work for me.," And I never will, sir.", Good day., So what'd you guys talk about at dinner?

Knope.,It is fantastic to be here.,Would you gentlemen like a tour?,There is quite literally nothing I would rather have in the world than a tour of the Parks and Recreation Department of the great City of Pawnee led by Ron Swanson and Leslie Knope.,Okay.,Ben?,I don't think that's a great idea.,Let's do it!,Great!,Chris is the most positive state budget auditing consultant I have ever met.,"I mean, I made eye contact with him, and it was like staring into the sun.","People, we are here from the state budget office from Indianapolis.",Ooh.,What does that mean?,"Look, simply we are here to tinker with your budget.",Think of the government as a brokendown carousel.,"We're going to slap on a new coat of paint, we are going to fix that broken speaker system, and we are going to get those happy kids back up on the horses where they belong!",Okay?,Yeah.,Okay?,Okay.,"Yeah, that's not bad.",There it is.,"My partner, Ben, is going to stick around for a little bit, and I will see you all later.",Adis!,Do you have a second?,I really like your shirt.,So I'd like to talk about where you think there's waste within your department.,Where do I start?,There is none.,What exactly will you be cutting?,And how much of it?,And can I watch you do it while eating pork cracklings?,"Okay, let's start with personnel.",What can you tell me about Jerry Gergich?,He is one of the best people on the planet.,He's universally adored here.,"If you fired him, there would be a revolt.","Okay, you need to understand that just to keep this town afloat, we probably have to cut the budget of every department by 40 or 50%.",Okay?,"Well, but Chris said that you just had to, you know, tinker with things.","Yeah, he said that because that sounds a lot better than ""We're going to gut it with a machete.",""" Okay?",You're a jerk.,I'm sorry?,Easy.,I'm sorry.,"These are real people in a real town, working in a real building, with real feelings.",This building has feelings?,Maybe.,There's a lot of history in this one.,Maybe it does.,How can you be so blas about this?,"Because I didn't cause these problems, Ms.",Knope.,Your government did.,I'll get what I need from the spreadsheets.,Thanks.,What's a not gay way to ask him to go camping with me?,JeanRalphio.,"Looking hot, Big T.",Throw them bows What?,"Damn, girl, who are you trying to impress?",Just kidding.,I know.,Walk away.,"Yep, you got it.",Got you a birthday shot.,"Thanks, but now that it's legal, I've kind of lost interest.",Suit yourself.,I guess our awesome new park is on hold.,You have any idea what they're going to cut?,Nope.,I don't know.,It's just been a really crappy day.,Where were you earlier when I called?,Talking to Mark.,Again?,Yeah.,You want to get super drunk?,I really do.,Yeah.,Where's our lady?,Hey!,Hey.,I hope you all know I was instrumental in getting Trish crowned Miss Pawnee.,What was your talent again?,"Oh, yeah.",Looking amazing.,"Hey, ladies, is there anything you desire at all, besides me?",So funny.,You are so funny!,"I'm serious, though.",Are you into me?,What?,"Chug that, bitch!",Rules are rules.,"Hey, April.","Oh, my gosh.",You look amazing.,Let me see you.,No.,Give me a twirl.,No.,This is beautiful.,Don't look at me.,"No, look at me.",Happy birthday.,Thank you.,Can I get you a drink?,Or wait.,"Yeah, I can swing it.",Can I get you a drink?,Whiskey.,Neat.,Wow.,You're not messing around.,No.,I'm not.,Barkeep.,Andy Dwyer!,It's so awesome to see you.,"Hey, you, too.",How are you?,Let me ask you a question.,Was I a good girlfriend?,"Ann, you were an awesome girlfriend.",Really?,Yeah.,Aw!,"I mean, I was the screwup.","Yeah, you were.","We had a good relationship, right?","God, I think so.","I mean, we fought a lot.",I know.,I know.,I know that.,Let me ask you something.,I'm hot.,Is that a question?,When we were together I can't see.,When we were together.,Yes.,"Were there times that you were like, ""If I don't see Ann in, like, Yes, all the time.",I loved Andy.,Loved him.,Loved Andy.,He was a totally helpless baby when we met.,I dated him for three years.,"Now, he's an adult with a job.",And some other girl is going to reap the rewards of my hard work?,That's bull.,"And I'm reading this, and I'm like, ""How could they hurt those gorillas like that?",""" They're such gentle, magnificent creatures, you know?",I'm an animal lover.,I don't know.,"Hey, I want you to keep this bottle cap.",So you always remember me and the first time we met.,Classic game.,Plant the seed.,"Harvest, like, a half hour later.",Here you go.,Sorry that took forever.,God.,"Hey, baby, you miss me?",Because I missed you.,"Oh, look at this.",JeanRalphio.,Hey.,Hey.,Andy.,Andy.,That's an all right name.,That's an all right name.,Thank you.,Yeah.,Are you guys Are you guys hanging out together?,"Yeah, maybe.",Yep.,"You know, he asked me out so many times.",I guess he wore me down.,I'm very persistent.,Come over here.,Come over here.,I can hear you.,I can hear you.,Come on.,"One time, I waited outside a woman's house for five days just to show her how serious I was about wanting to drill her.",Turns out it was the wrong house.,"She loved the story, anyway.",We got to third base.,Over the pants.,That's so cute.,"Yeah, super cute.",Wow.,Right?,Do you want a Rmy Martin?,Probably good.,"Okay, I'll get you one.",Two Rmy Martins!,Here we go!,You can have my Rmy Martin for your birthday.,I thought she liked me.,I guess I'm super bad at picking up signals.,That Ralph Macchio guy is a total douche.,Did I give you a bottle cap?,"Excuse me, did I give you a bottle cap?",What?,Did I give any of you guys a bottle cap?,You sure?,Who the did I give a bottle cap to?,This party sucks.,Let's get out of here.,It's my birthday party.,It is?,Yes.,"I'm sorry, boo.",You know what's thirsty?,What?,You know what's weird?,How thirsty I get when I'm weird.,When I'm drunk.,"Ben, the jerk, is here.",Who are?,That one.,The one coming over here.,Get ready.,"Okay, Leslie, be professional.",Hi.,"Hello, Ben.","Look, I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot.",So I just wanted to stop by and Yeah.,"Well, save your breath.",Okay?,Just get out of here.,"Because this is a party with my friends, and you're trying to fire all my friends.","I Plus, I just talked to everybody in this bar, and nobody wants you here.",Okay.,Then I'll just see you tomorrow.,Sorry to bother you.,Get out of here.,Leslie?,That was so professional.,I'm so proud of you.,Thank you.,You have to help me.,Ow.,I know.,"Me, too.",But you have to help me.,I think I may have made out with someone last night.,"Oh, no.",Who?,I don't remember.,I don't even know if it happened.,I just had this feeling when I woke up this morning like I definitely kissed somebody.,No.,"Hey, Ann.","Wow, that was a crazy night last night.","Yeah, crazy.","I mean, I left at 11:15, and you were still raging pretty hard.",I was.,I was.,Good.,Yeah.,So it's not Jerry.,Help me.,I'll keep an ear to the ground.,"But right now, I have to go swallow my pride.","Leslie, Leslie.","Welcome, welcome, welcome.",Wow.,You have a lot of bottles there.,Yeah.,Would you like a vitamin?,B12?,Evening primrose oil?,Willow bark?,Magnesium?,"No, thank you.",You sure?,Really good for hangovers.,"Okay, I'll take one.",I take care of my body above all else.,"Diet, exercise, supplements, and positive thinking.",Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born.,I believe I am that human being.,So what brings you here so early?,"I'm here to speak to Ben, actually.",Great.,I'm gonna listen to some ocean sounds and do some chinups.,So I'd like to apologize for yesterday.,Don't worry about it.,"No, what I did was out of line.",Twice.,"And I was worked up, because obviously, you represent a threat to my department.",Your City Council and your Mayor are the threats to your department.,"We didn't do anything to get you into this situation, okay?",Okay.,"Look, Ben, I don't appreciate your callous attitude, okay?",Really?,"Yeah, really.",Okay.,"You may hold my fate in your hands like a small bird, but I still think you're an ass.",You want to get a beer?,It's like 10:30 in the morning.,Yeah.,And you seem like you could use a beer.,Let's get a beer.,"Well Oh, oh, oh.",Don't keep him too long.,I need someone to be here when I take my multivitamin.,There's a choking hazard.,"Okay, can we go?","Oh, my God.","You don't remember anything that happened last night, do you?",No.,Wow.,"For once, it's Ann who blacked out drunk and not Andy.",Okay.,"Oh, my gosh.",That's really dangerous.,Please tell me.,This is going to be so fun letting you dangle until I finally reveal that we did not make out.,Oh.,Damn it.,Good.,See you.,All right.," Hey, I need to settle my bill from last night.", Tom Haverford., Okay., Wow.," You had 47 drinks last night? Ten cosmos, eight Smirnoff Ices, and everything else starts with the word pomegranate."," Was it your bachelorette party? No, I invited a bunch of girls here last night, and they all put drinks on my tab.", And then I went home alone., I'm not sure what happened.," You invited a bunch of girls here, and then you tried to hit on all of them.", Fair enough.," I mean, what were you expecting was gonna happen, a 43-way? That would have been a little out of control.", But awesome.," Yeah, the problem is I only have 15 penises, so There would have been 28 girls that were really upset with me.", Yeah.," All right, well, thanks."," Hey, would you wanna get a drink tomorrow night? Does it have to be here? No."," Then, sure.", I'm Lucy., Let me give you my phone number.," Wow, that tastes really good.", How's your head? Mushy., I'm sorry that I yelled at you., All three times., But I don't think you know anything about my department.," Have you ever been part of a government body before? I have, yeah."," Small town called Partridge, Minnesota.", Why does that sound familiar? You're Benji Wyatt? I am.," When I was 18, I ran for mayor of my small town.", And won.," A little bit of anti-establishment voter rebellion, I guess."," Here's the thing, though, about 18 year-olds.", They're idiots., So I pretty much ran the place into the ground after two months and got impeached., The worst part was my parents grounded me.," Oh, my God.", You were so cute.," Well, thank you.", What was that song you played at the swearing-in ceremony? Whoomp!., Yes., That's what it was., Yeah.," God, I was so jealous of you.", You shouldn't have been.," I mean, it ended up kind of ruining my life."," And now, I'm balancing budgets so I can show people I'm responsible."," So I can run for office again someday and not be laughed at, you know."," I mean, you want to run for office someday, right? Yeah."," How did you know? Well, you have to be able to make decisions like this, Leslie."," You have to be harsh, you know? No one's going to elect you to do anything if you don't show that you're a responsible grown-up.", Yeah.," Oh, no."," Please, Mr."," Mayor, let me.", Whoomp there it is Okay., Mmm., Mmm., Everything okay? Hmm? Mmm., No., You ready? Yeah.," Hey, Ron, did we make out last night? Good God, woman.", No., Okay.," Well, that's it.", That's all the men that I know., You guys just knocked it completely out of the park.," And I appreciate it, and we will see you later."," Hey, Ann Perkins.", Hey.," Hey, well April's party? April's party? Yeah."," Hey, man.", How's it going? Hi., Hey.," Yeah, Tom.", Hey., Come here.," There's no reason not to love him, but I didn't.", Highway to the Danger Zone I've called you a cab.," You know, I just Okay, let's get you in the cab.", Come on., Boo., Fancy this.," Listen, I have meetings all day, but I'd love to chat with you."," Can I call you? You have my phone number? No, you couldn't remember your phone number, but you gave me your phone.", Terrific., That's great., We'll talk later., Okay.," Danger zone Come on, guys.", We'll talk later., This suggested plan reduces our overall budget by 35%.," And it contains very practical, deep cuts in many of our services."," Wow, Leslie.", This is amazing., But it's moot., Why? Our investigation has revealed that things in Pawnee are much worse than we anticipated.," Meaning what? Well, effective tomorrow morning, the entire government will be shut down until further notice.", I'm sorry., I just started hearing really loud circus music in my head.," What did you say? November, your bangs are cute November, your voice is a flute November, let's pretend the sky is for us Let's spread our wings and fly on a date I want to go on a date with you, November That song is about April.",   ,"
                ",Season: 2 Episode: 24,Ron!,"Hello, Andy.",It's quiet in here.,Where is everyone?,The government is shut down.,It's in every newspaper.,How long is it going to last?,"Well, if we're lucky, this building will be empty for months.",Wow.,That is really bad timing.,I just got this super sweetass rad crotch rocket.,I've always wanted one of these.,"But due to, you know, never having a job, I couldn't afford it until now.",Got a really good deal on my lease.,Paying 12% interest.,"It's, like, one of the highest you can get.","Hey, so I've been trying like crazy to get a hold of April.","If you see her, will you tell her I really need to talk to her?",You got it.,All right.,"Thanks, Ron.",Uhoh!,Nailed it.,All I can tell you is that all the parks are closed until further notice.,"Look, no one is more upset about this than I am.",Not like it's a competition or anything.,"Because if it was, I would win.",But that's neither here nor there.,The point is I would win.,How long will they be closed?,Could be forever.,"With the government shut down, who is going to stop AlQaeda?",One thing at a time.,School is out in two weeks.,What am I going to do with my kids all day?,Keep them in my house?,Where I live?,I don't know what to tell you.,What about the kids' concert tomorrow at Ramsett Park?,The Freddy Spaghetti concert.,Freddy Spaghetti has been canceled.,"Well, sit down and tell me exactly what has happened.","Every year, we kick off the summer with a children's concert series.","And this year, the concert has been canceled due to the shutdown.","It's terrible, and we need to fix it.",All right.,Great.,"I'm very glad that you agree with me, but I actually worked really hard on my argument.",Is there any way I can still kind of Yeah?,I'd love to hear it.,"Oh, good.",Thank you.,You're wrong.,Are you crazy?,Can you put a price tag on a child's smile?,Leslie Knope.,What a surprise.,"The government has been shut for two days, and one city employee has tried to schedule 14 meetings with me.",Can you guess who?,Ben?,There was a big concert.,"Now, there's not.",Isn't there anything that we can do about that?,"No, there isn't.",That's too bad.,"Sorry, Leslie.",Damn!,I have to go run 10 miles.,I have run 10 miles a day every day for 18 years.,"That's 65,000 miles.",A third of the way to the moon.,My goal is to run to the moon.,"Ben, let's talk solutions.","Leslie, Pawnee is broke.",There's no money for a concert.,Okay?,"I mean, Idaho cut their Parks Department by 80%, and Idaho is basically one giant park.","I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Ben.",Pawnee is better than Idaho.,"No, Pawnee is not special.",Okay?,"Your department, all the way down here, is not a priority.","And frankly, you're not even supposed to be in the building, Leslie.",You're nonessential.,That is not your call.,"I know, it's on your badge.",This?,This isn't me.,Ann Perkins.,Chris something.,Hi.,"I was just doing my daily lunchtime 10 miles and I ran by the hospital, and I thought I'd pop up and say hi.",Did you just start your run?,"No, I'm already at mile nine.",But you're not sweating at all.,I know.,I have a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute.,The scientist who studied me said that my heart could pump jet fuel up into an airplane.,I'd love to go out on a date with you.,I think you might find me attractive because you got drunk and kissed me when we first met.,"And no pressure, but I do have tonight open.",I am so sorry.,I'm really busy right now.,No problem.,I will try again soon.,Ann Perkins.,"That's the guy who likes you, that you're not into.",Yeah.,And which part of him are you not looking at?,"Traditionally, when I end a longterm relationship, I'm a little fragile, and I have a tendency to do some reckless things.",So I need to stay away from Chris.,I can't stand this government shutdown.,I can't stand this budget crisis.,But what I can't stand is they're canceling Freddy Spaghetti.,You know everything.,What should I do about this?,"I don't know, Leslie.",Why don't you see a movie or go shopping?,Wait a minute.,What are you doing?,What's happening?,"You know, they offered me a buyout, and I took it.","And so now, I work for Norton Construction.",Sorry.,I know I shouldn't have done that.,It's okay.,How could you quit?,"You know, not everyone has your enthusiasm for this work.","You know, I guess I've been mispronouncing your name all these years.",Mark Brendanaquitz.,"Recently, I had been thinking about maybe leaving this job.",But I felt like I needed a sign.,"And then Ann broke up with me the week that I was going to propose, the government got shut down, and yesterday one of those pigeons took a on me.",And I was indoors.,So What are you doing here?,"Hey, sorry.",I need your help.,Is this a bad time?,Lucy is here.,I'm in my sexy pajamas.,I just took four Benadryls to dull my sensitivity.,"Yes, it is a bad time.",You're about to have sex.,Why else would Boyz II Men's On Bended Knee be playing right now?,Okay.,"I just want to give you a little advice, which is don't make it last really long.",Ladies don't like that.,Okay.,Great.,Okay?,Wait.,Just one more thing.,Are you using protection?,You know what?,I'm just going to stay away from all guys right now.,Yeah.,"Less mantime, more Anntime.",Yeah.,Yeah.,"The only guy that I care about right now is six feet tall with wild, crazy hair and a ukulele that doubles as a water gun.",Freddy Spaghetti.,Children's concerts aren't a priority these days.,You know what is?,Sewage.,Pawnee's kids are less important than poop tubes.,I don't know.,"I mean, what are you going to do?",That's the way it is.,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.","If all the parks are closed, why not just have the concert in the lot behind my house?","Ann, you devious bastard.","Well, the cow goes ""moo"" and the pig goes ""oink"" Well, I've spent the last three hours coming up with a plan.",And I sent up the BatSignal for all the people in the Parks Department to come and join us.,I told them to be here by 8:00.,Do you think anybody is going to show up?,"A, yes.","B, even if they don't, we'll just put the concert on ourselves.","But C, yes.","Yes, they're definitely going to show up.","Although, D, maybe not.",I think that you need to prepare for the eventuality that no one Hello?,Hello?,"God bless you, Jerry Gergich!",Wow.,I never thought I'd hear those words from you.,Hey.,April is here.,"Move, Jerry.",April.,I didn't think you were going to help.,I still might not.,"Jerry, how do you feel about lifting heavy things?",My doctor just said I should avoid Being a wuss?,"Yes, I agree.","So, go out there and get the equipment out of the truck.","With current and projected deficits, we need to cut expenditures by 32%.",Let's make it an even 40.,That's not necessary.,Slash it.,Slash it.,I am an official member of a task force dedicated to slashing the city budget.,Just saying that gave me a semi.,"Right off the bat, we sell City Hall.",Let somebody turn it into a large gas station or a T.,J.,Maxx.,"Ron, that is a very creative idea.","But we don't want to sell any of our major assets, because we don't want to lose out on any future revenue streams.",I hear that.,Don't worry.,I have tons more ideas.,"Okay, uh So sorry.",New ring tone.,Don't cut anything without me.,Leslie?,I don't care if you hate what we do.,I love it enough for both of us.,"We're going to put on the Freddy Spaghetti concert today, 5:00 on Lot 48.",You can't do that.,Watch me.,"We're going to do this, Ron.",With or without you.,Hammering away.,Crank it.,Hit it.,Needs 16 minutes for premium bounce.,"Oh, hey, after this, can you go pick up Freddy Spaghetti in your Mercedes?",We need to give him the star treatment.,Hey.,Sorry we're late.,I had to wait on my girlfriend to finish eating breakfast.,Hi.,I'm Lucy.,Hi.,Hey.,We had dinner last night and breakfast this morning.,What were we doing in between?,Sex stuff.,"You guys know Tom really well, so I don't have to apologize for his behavior, right?",Right.,"The craziest thing is it's, like, super loud.",You know what I mean?,"I was on it for only five minutes, and I can't really hear anything.",Am I talking loud right now?,Yeah.,April!,Hey!,Excuse me.,I called you a gajillion times.,Why didn't you call me back?,I'm so sorry.,I was too busy not wanting to talk to you.,Huh?,"Jerry, what are you doing?",Leslie asked me to post these around the neighborhood.,I'll do it.,Really?,Wow.,Yes.,You want some help with that?,"Okay, let's talk about Parks and Rec.",This one is a little complicated.,I know what will loosen up our brains.,Massage train.,And I know what you're thinking.,It's not that I want a massage.,I'll be the caboose.,And Ron Swanson is the locomotive.,"And thanks to Ron, the services budget has already been cut significantly.","So, seems like the best option is job cuts.",Starting with Leslie Knope.,"No, no, no, no, no.","If you fire Leslie, you might as well just get rid of the department.","Look, I know how valuable she is, believe me.",But we've run out of options.,There are plenty of other options.,"For example, sell the zoo animals.",Okay.,To whom?,Cosmetics labs?,Weird restaurants?,I'm just spitballing here.,"Okay, let's switch it up.","Look, she makes the secondhighest salary in the department.",It will go a long way.,I'm telling you.,It's just not an option.,"Ron, focus up, buddy.",Just give me a sec.,Will you just stop and listen to me?,No.,Fine.,"I don't want to talk to you, anyways.",Reverse psychiatry.,Fine.,What?,I like you.,"In a, you know, romantical kind of way.",You do?,Yes.,Do you like me?,Yes.,"So, then perhaps, shall we go out this evening?",No.,I don't think we should see each other.,Damn it.,Because you're 21 and I'm 29?,No.,I don't care about that.,"It's because whenever I see you talk to Ann or talk about Ann, I feel like you still have feelings for her.",What?,"No, I don't.",But I don't.,"Really, I don't.","Well, I think you do.",So That's a problem for me.,"Because of my libertarian beliefs, Leslie does 95% of the work.",So you should lay me off.,I'd be proud to be a casualty in this righteous war.,It's precisely because of your beliefs that we need to keep you.,You would maintain fiscal responsibility after we're gone.,I strenuously object.,Okay.,"Well, Ron, we're moving on.",Every department is losing a Leslie Knope.,"No, Ben, they are not.",No other department has one to begin with.,"Right now, she's singlehandedly putting up some lousy concert for this city's kids.",She's doing what?,Could someone else massage my shoulders?,Wow.,Looking good.,Yeah.,"I mean, I wish we had built one of those elevators that comes up from under the stage, you know?",They're coming!,Like a rock arena kind of thing?,They're coming!,What?,They're coming.,What's up?,What?,Who?,The Russians?,"No, the state auditors.",I accidentally told them what you were doing in an attempt to save some government jobs.,It's been a very strange day for me.,Okay.,"Everybody, be cool.",Just be cool.,Hey!,Hey!,Hey!,Hey!,All right.,Everybody!,Everybody!,Hey.,Ann Perkins.,Hi.,Hi.,Everyone.,You are all super amazing.,"You are what makes Pawnee great, and I just want to tell you that I am totally supportive of your inspiring efforts here today!",All right.,Yeah.,"Now, my partner Ben wants to say something.","Yeah, we're shutting this down.",What?,Damn!,That's terrible news!,"Surely, there has to be a solution, Ben.",No.,Ben says no.,"I'm sorry, everyone.","The concert is canceled, everybody.",No.,"Here's the thing, though, Ben.",It's not canceled.,We're putting it on.,Okay?,Because the stage is already built.,Everything was donated for free by local vendors.,Everyone here believes that what we're doing is essential.,Freddy Spaghetti will sing.,"Actually, Leslie, I just found out.",Freddy Spaghetti ain't coming.,Freddy Spaghetti may not sing.,But something much cooler is going to happen.,I think.,Ann?,Okay.,Good job.,You should hydrate.,"When we canceled on him, he took another gig in Eagleton.",At a library.,That's literally the worst place I can imagine.,Okay.,Guys?,We're not giving up on this.,He's not the only musician in town.,Andy.,"I don't know, Leslie.",I don't really feel like playing right now.,"Andy, please.","Please, please, please, please, please.",I don't even have children's songs.,My last song I wrote was called Sex Hair.,"Well, just take the word ""sex"" and change it to ""pickle.",""" Pickle?","You got pickle hair, baby And you got it from me Yeah.",Still sounds like it's about sex.,I'm in.,I've got to grab my guitar from my

April.Ron Swanson,I don't like to get involved in people's personalAndy Dwyer,"I hurt her feelings, and now she's pissed at me."Andy Dwyer,"I feel like if I could just explain myself, she'd understand,  but she's avoiding me."Andy Dwyer,It's making me miserable.Ron Swanson,"April's in the hospital, sick with the flu."Andy Dwyer,What?Andy Dwyer,I knew it!Andy Dwyer,I didn't know

Festival."Tom Haverford,"Ladies and gentlemen, Leslie Knope!"Leslie Knope,"Every one of you, just by showing up here tonight,  has already made history."Leslie Knope,"In days past, the Harvest Festival was the cornerstone  of Pawnee's smallbusiness community,  a weeklong showcase  for everything from textiles to small farms."Leslie Knope,"  By our estimates, as many as 30,000 people might attend the festival,  and the monetary value  of that kind of direct customer-to-business exposure  is, frankly, incalculable."April Ludgate,What?Ann Perkins,"Three, two, one."Ann Perkins,"  And my shift's over."Ann Perkins,What the fuck is your problem?April Ludgate,Whoa I thought you weren't gonna lose it.Ann Perkins,"Well I was on duty,  I didn't."Ann Perkins, Now it's

me forever?April Ludgate,Okay.Ann Perkins," - Fine!  You know what? I don't care."Ann Perkins,"  But you shouldn't take it out on Andy,  because he really likes you, and he did nothing

is Pawnee."Leslie Knope,"  Let's make history."Leslie Knope,"  - Thank you."Ben Wyatt," - That was amazing."Ben Wyatt,"

So if you have any other questions,  you can just direct them towards me."Leslie Knope,"  Give it up, everybody, for Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap."Ben Wyatt,"  All right."Ben Wyatt," Okay, let's  Excuse me."Ben Wyatt,"  And to answer your question, sir,  there will be sales-tax incentives this year."Tom Haverford,"  I think I should drive you to the hospital."Leslie Knope,"  Was I wearing a tiara when I came in here?  Because if you happen upon it,  will you have Lady Pennyface retrieve it and send it post-hence?  - Oh, hey."Ben Wyatt," - Hey, there."Ben Wyatt,"  I got you some waffles here, courtesy of JJ's diner,  and chicken soup, courtesy of me."Leslie Knope,"  - I'll take the waffles."Leslie Knope, Thank you.Ben Wyatt," - Okay."Leslie Knope,So how did the rest of the meeting go?Ben Wyatt,"Well, you said you needed eighty total businesses to participate."Leslie Knope,"  Yeah."Ben Wyatt,"  We have 110,  and counting."Ben Wyatt,"  So, nice work, Leslie."Leslie Knope,"  Nice work to you too."Ben Wyatt,"  Left the chicken soup there, just in case."Ben Wyatt,"  It's an old family recipe."Ben Wyatt,"

official town slogan we've ever had."April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, Leslie."Leslie Knope,I know.Leslie Knope,Can you believe it?April Ludgate,That's crazy.Leslie Knope,Isn't it?Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, The Paris of America."Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, The Akron of Southwest Indiana."Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Welcome, German soldiers."""Leslie Knope,"After the Nazis took France, our mayor kind of panicked."Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, The factory fire capital of America."Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Welcome, Vietnamese soldiers."""Leslie Knope,"Pawnee,""Engage with Zorp."""Leslie Knope,"For a brief time in the '70s, our town was taken over by a cult."Leslie Knope,Zorp is dead.Leslie Knope,Long live Zorp.Leslie Knope,""" It's safe to be here now."Leslie Knope,"Pawnee, "" Birthplace of Julia

capsule is our way of saying that Pawnee is gonna be around for a long time Capsule."Leslie Knope,And you can quote me on that.Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"I'm actually gonna quote you on all of this, 'cause it's a newspaper article."Leslie Knope,I thought of a great headline.Shauna Malwae-Tweep,Great.Leslie Knope,"""It's Time to Encapsulate the Future."Shauna Malwae-Tweep,""" Good one."Leslie Knope,"Sub headline, ""The Parks Department Cuts the Crapsule, Buries the Time Capsule."Shauna Malwae-Tweep,""" I'll be back tomorrow with the photographer."Leslie Knope,Okay.April Ludgate,"Leslie,

Knope,"Oh, I'm sorry."Leslie Knope,We're not taking Twilight books.Kelly Larson,"It's a beautifully told saga of vampires, werewolves and romance."Leslie Knope,You are the person that's been emailing me about Twilight.Leslie Knope,I thought you would be younger.Leslie Knope,And a girl.Kelly Larson,"Well, I'm not."Kelly Larson,I'm older and a boy.Kelly Larson,But I feel very strongly that these should be included.Kelly Larson,Can I tell you why?Leslie Knope,"Sure, Kelly."Leslie Knope,Have a seat.Kelly Larson,Awesome.Leslie Knope,And plead your case.Kelly Larson,Thanks.Kelly Larson,"Okay, Christmas Eve, 1973."Kelly Larson,"Author Stephenie Meyer, ne Morgan, was born in Hartford, Connecticut."Leslie Knope,Oh.Leslie Knope,You're going all the way back to her birth.Leslie Knope,Okay.Andy Dwyer,"So basically, Ann kissed me and then April kissed me, and I told April, because of honesty is important."Chris Traeger,That's so true.Andy Dwyer,"But now she's gone and gotten herself a Venezuelan boyfriend who's, like, the handsomest dude I've ever seen."Andy Dwyer,Present company excluded.Chris Traeger,"Oh, thank you."Andy Dwyer,I was talking about me.Ann Perkins,Hey.Chris Traeger,Ann Perkins!Chris Traeger,Andy just gave me a phenomenal shoeshine and I did not know that you two once lived together.Ann Perkins,Yes.Ann Perkins,"Yes, we did."Ann Perkins,Thank you for catching him up on our history.Chris Traeger,"Andy, that was an amazing shoeshine."Chris Traeger,I can literally see my face in my shoes.Chris Traeger,See you later!Andy Dwyer,He didn't He didn't pay me.Ann Perkins,Why are you hanging out with Chris?Andy Dwyer,He just sat down.Andy Dwyer,What am I supposed to do?Andy Dwyer,He's my boss.Ann

beg you."Ann Perkins,"I just started dating Chris, and I don't know how, but Andy's gonna screw it up."Ann Perkins,Andy screws everything up.Ann Perkins,"When we were dating, I bought him a fish and I don't want to get into it, but somehow that fish ended up dead in a cowboy boot."Kelly Larson,"And combined, they have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide."Kelly Larson,"Now, have you seen any of the Twilight movies?"Leslie Knope,"No, I have not."Kelly Larson,"Well, let me describe them to you shot for shot."Kelly Larson,Movie number one.Kelly Larson,Twilight.Kelly Larson,We slowly pan up over a mossy log to see a deer drinking crystalclear water.Leslie Knope,"Okay, Kelly, this time capsule isn't just a barrel full of stuff that people like."Leslie Knope,"It's about life in Pawnee at this moment in time, and there is nothing in Twilight that is specific to Pawnee."Kelly Larson,"I disagree, okay?"Kelly Larson,"The town of Forks, Washington is exactly like Pawnee, except for the climate and the vampires."Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.Leslie Knope,I have to say no.Kelly Larson,I beg you to reconsider.Leslie Knope,And I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.Kelly Larson,Then I'm gonna have to do this.Leslie Knope,He brought handcuffs with him.Leslie Knope,This whole thing was planned.April Ludgate,I think it's kind of cool.Leslie Knope,It's not cool.Leslie Knope,"It's trespassing, and that is breaking the rules."Leslie Knope,Cool people make the rules.Leslie Knope,They don't break the rules.Leslie Knope,"And if those kids want you to break the rules, they're not really your friends."April Ludgate,"Whoa, who are you even talking about?"Leslie Knope,I don't know.Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.Leslie Knope,I'm just annoyed.Leslie Knope,"But while we're on the subject, your friend Orrin, with the long black nails and the cloak?"Leslie Knope,He concerns me.April Ludgate,He's a genius.Ron Swanson,I'll take care of this trespasser.Ron Swanson,Give me 30 seconds.Leslie Knope,I'm just gonna call security.Ben Wyatt,"Guys, can we push the meeting an hour?"Ben Wyatt,What's going on?Leslie Knope,Some guy handcuffed himself to a pipe in my office because we wouldn't put a copy of Twilight in the time capsule.Ben Wyatt,Damn it.Ben Wyatt,Again?Kelly Larson,You look sad.Tom Haverford,You look like a weird goon who's obsessed with a kid's book.Kelly Larson,"It's a girl, isn't it?"Kelly Larson,I can tell.Kelly Larson,It's the look that Mike had on his face when Bella turned him down for the dance.Tom Haverford,"Oh, yeah?"Tom Haverford,Is it?Tom Haverford,What look did your mom have on her face when she realized her son was a complete failure?Kelly Larson,"Okay, I'll be quiet."Kelly Larson,But I do know something about heartbreak.Kelly Larson,And you know who else does?Tom Haverford,"Kenneth ""Babyface"" Edmonds?"Kelly Larson,No.Kelly Larson,A little lady named Twilight author Stephenie Meyer.Donna Meagle,Trust me.Donna Meagle,You should listen to him.Donna Meagle,Those books are good.Donna Meagle,"Oh, I love any book about vampires, werewolves, monsters, zombies, sorcerers, beasties or timetraveling romances."Donna Meagle,"And if I had an hour alone with Robert Pattinson, he would forget all about Skinnylegs McGee."Donna Meagle,I'll tell you that much.Leslie Knope,"Okay, buddy, time is up."Leslie Knope,Give us the keys.Kelly Larson,They're hidden somewhere very far away.Leslie Knope,Then we're gonna have to cut you loose.Kelly Larson,Why?Kelly Larson,I'm not doing anything wrong.Ron Swanson,"Yes, you are."Ron Swanson,You're trespassing.Kelly Larson,"Well, the fact remains this is perfectly legal."Leslie Knope,"No, it's not."Leslie Knope,You're trespassing.Kelly Larson,"Look, I really don't want to cause any trouble, but I am not gonna leave until you put Twilight in the time capsule."Kelly Larson,This muscleheaded

hours, he's gonna be so hungry and freaked out, he's gonna be begging me to He brought a pillow."Kelly Larson,"Hey, Leslie, I'm making some Sleepytime tea."Kelly Larson,Do you want any?Tom Haverford,"Hey, dude, wake up, man."Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Tom."Tom Haverford,Twilight is dope.Kelly Larson,I told you.Tom Haverford,I couldn't put it down.Tom Haverford,It was like she was

Larson,And a third and a fourth.Tom Haverford,No way.Chris Traeger,It's fantastic.Andy Dwyer,Yeah.Andy Dwyer,I worked really hard.Andy Dwyer,I did every pair that I could.Andy Dwyer,I didn't know what to do with these.Andy Dwyer,I think they're gloves.Chris Traeger,"No, no, no, no."Chris Traeger,Those are sports sandals.Chris Traeger,They are for adventure racing.Chris Traeger,"They perfectly contour to the human foot, and the human foot is the ultimate technology."Andy Dwyer,"Dude, that is the coolest sentence I've ever heard somebody talk."Chris Traeger,"So you love April, and she has a new boyfriend, right?"Andy Dwyer,You got all of that from a picture?Chris Traeger,"No, you told me yesterday."Chris Traeger,"Andy, I want to help you win her over."Chris Traeger,Why do I want to help him?Chris Traeger,Because he's a good person.Chris Traeger,I love good people.Andy Dwyer,"Hey, you know who should wear these shoes?"Andy Dwyer,Monkeys.Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Well, this is an interesting turn of events."Leslie Knope,Is it?Leslie Knope,I don't know.Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess it's kind of interesting."Leslie Knope,"What the real story is is how wonderful our time capsule is and how it perfectly encapsulates, a word I really think you should use, what our town is all about."Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"Hey, how's this for a headline?"Shauna Malwae-Tweep,"""Parks Department Foiled by Pipe Dreams."Leslie Knope,""" God, that's an amazing headline, but please don't write that story."Chris Traeger,"The key to April's heart is within you, Andy."Chris Traeger,You need to tap in to the aspects of your personality that she once found attractive to make yourself the best version of yourself.Chris Traeger,What's great about you?Andy Dwyer,I'm nice.Chris Traeger,Good!Chris Traeger,Nice.Chris Traeger,What else?Andy Dwyer,I'm in a band.Chris Traeger,Band!Chris Traeger,What else?Andy Dwyer,That's it.Tom Haverford,Am I team Edward?Tom Haverford,Yes.Tom Haverford,"Do I share his concerns about turning Bella, though?"Tom Haverford,Absolutely not.Kelly Larson,"Edward's primary goal, at all times, is Bella's protection."Leslie Knope,"Can you please, please be quiet?"Kelly Larson,Sorry.Kelly Larson,Sorry.Kelly Larson,Let's keep it down.Kelly Larson,Be considerate.Kelly Larson,"Look at it this way, Tom."Kelly Larson,Bella's love for Edward is being tested.Tom Haverford,By Jacob?Donna Meagle,Mmm.Donna Meagle,Not exactly.Tom Haverford,The Volturi?Donna Meagle,Yes.Leslie Knope,"Okay, you know what?"Leslie Knope,All right.Leslie Knope,"I'm gonna go do my work in the conference room, 'cause you guys are the worst."Kelly Larson,"You seem tense, Leslie."Kelly Larson,You know what you should do?Leslie Knope,Read Twilight?Kelly Larson,Read Twilight.Kelly Larson,Here.Leslie Knope,"Yeah, thanks."Tom Haverford,Sometimes I think she's in the Volturi.Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Kelly."Kelly Larson,"Oh, morning, Leslie."Kelly Larson,"Hope you don't mind, I moved myself over to this pipe."Kelly Larson,It's a little more comfortable.Leslie Knope,No problem.Leslie Knope,Did you have a nice night?Leslie Knope,Sleep well?Kelly Larson,"It was all right, considering."Leslie Knope,Picked you up some coffee.Kelly Larson,Thank you so much.Kelly Larson,"Well, you seem pretty chipper this morning."Leslie Knope,"I am, Kelly, because I know why you're here."Leslie Knope,You know what I did last night?Kelly Larson,"Read Twilight, and it transformed your life and you're gonna put it in the time capsule?"Leslie Knope,"Well, I read the first 10 pages."Leslie Knope,"I couldn't really get into it, though."Leslie Knope,More of a Harry Potter girl myself.Kelly Larson,What?Leslie Knope,"But I looked in the inside cover, and I saw this."Leslie Knope,"Did a little research, and Liz Waverly is 12 years old, a straightA student at King Philip Middle."Leslie Knope,"She's also a member of many Twilight Internet message boards, and I'm guessing your daughter?"Leslie Knope,Is that why you did this?Leslie Knope,To impress your daughter?Kelly Larson,"Liz's mom and I divorced a couple years ago, and it's been really hard on her."Kelly Larson,She loves Twilight.Kelly Larson,"So, I read about your time capsule and I thought that if I could somehow convince you to get it in there, I'd be a big hero."Leslie Knope,That's really sweet.Leslie Knope,You should have told me you were doing this for your daughter.Kelly Larson,I didn't want to drag her into it.Kelly Larson,I'm sorry.Kelly Larson,This is a mistake.Kelly Larson,You don't have to put Twilight in the time capsule.Leslie Knope,I think we should put Twilight in the time capsule.Ron Swanson,"Leslie, no."Ron Swanson,We don't negotiate with weirdoes.Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, what happened to, ""A perfect encapsulation of life in Pawnee""?"Leslie Knope,"Well, for that guy, life in Pawnee is him and his daughter reading that book."Leslie Knope,"Besides, I can get Shauna on board."Leslie Knope,It would make a great human interest story.Ben Wyatt,"Uh, if this gets out, every time you want to do anything, some guy's gonna come into your office and handcuff himself to a pipe."Leslie Knope,"Well, yeah, that's a good point."Leslie Knope,Then we shall bring the pipe to them.Ron Swanson,"Oh, no."Leslie Knope,"Oh, yes."Ben Wyatt,What does that mean?Ron Swanson,Crackpot convention.Leslie Knope,So that's what today's forum is for.Leslie Knope,"We're gonna hear suggestions from everyone, and then whichever items we generally agree on will go into the time capsule."Leslie Knope,"Please remember, this is a government project, so we need to refrain from corporate promotion and religious items."Leslie Knope,Who'd like to start?Extra,I think we should put in the Bible.Leslie Knope,Great.Andy Dwyer,Eduardo.Andy Dwyer,"Hi, Eduardo."Andy Dwyer,I want to apologize.Andy Dwyer,Just because you're dating my soul mate doesn't give me any right to be a jerk to you.Andy Dwyer,"I promise from now on, I'm just gonna be super nice to you."Eduardo,Thank you for saying that.Andy Dwyer,You're welcome.Eduardo,What CDs are those?Andy Dwyer,Mouse Rat.Andy Dwyer,My band.Andy Dwyer,It's our latest album.Andy Dwyer,Yeah.Andy Dwyer,You like music?Andy Dwyer,What are you listening to?Eduardo,The Smiths.Eduardo,Very depressing!Andy Dwyer,April's making you listen to that?Eduardo,Mmm.Andy Dwyer,She's really into that indie stuff.Andy Dwyer,I'm more of a Dave Matthews guy myself.Eduardo,David Matthews!Eduardo,Crash into Me!Andy Dwyer,Yes!Andy Dwyer,I love that song.Andy Dwyer,"Here you go, here."Andy Dwyer,Take one.Andy Dwyer,Check us out.Andy Dwyer,"We're amazing, so let me know how much you like us."Eduardo,"Yeah, gracias."Andy Dwyer,"That means ""thank you""?"Eduardo,Yes.Andy Dwyer,Nailed it.Leslie Knope,"So, we have one very moving case for Twilight."Leslie Knope,Anyone else?Leslie Knope,Great.Leslie Knope,Two people for Twilight.Marcia Langman,"Oh, no, no, no, no."Marcia Langman,"I'm Marcia Langman, from the Society for Family Stability Foundation."Marcia Langman,This book contains pagan creatures and strong sexual overtones.Marcia Langman,There are girls quivering.Marcia Langman,"There are boys staring deeply into girls' eyes as they quiver, and so forth."Marcia Langman,There really is a tremendous amount of quivering.Marcia Langman,"It is antiChristian, it is proquivering, and the government has no business promoting it."Extra,I totally disagree.Leslie Knope,"Well, now we have two people for Twilight."Extra,Absolutely not.Extra,I'm with the National Civil Liberties Association.Extra,"That book actually contains overt Christian themes, and as such, has no business being associated with any government project."Leslie Knope,"So too Christian, and not Christian enough?"Leslie Knope,Do you see the irony here?Leslie Knope,No?Leslie Knope,Okay.Leslie Knope,"Uh Donna, why don't you put a question mark next to Twilight?"Kelly Larson, No!Kelly Larson, You promised!Marcia Langman, You promised?Marcia Langman, That's not fair!Extra," Wait, it's not a question of fairness."Marcia Langman," It's Go back to Russia, commie! Hey, you go back to Russia! You go back to wherever you came from! Why would I go to Russia? I have no interest in traveling to Russia."Extra," Can I just say that? And who else? I would like to include my favorite book, Crazy from the Heat, the David Lee Roth story."Leslie Knope," Well, I think if we're gonna be adding a book to the time capsule, it would probably be Twilight."Extra, I don't care about Twilight.Extra, Why is this only about his favorite book? I want my favorite book in there.Leslie Knope," Okay, I have an idea."Leslie Knope, Two time capsules.Leslie Knope," One that totally encapsulates what's happening right now in Pawnee in this moment in time and the other one that's just for items of personal significance, like Twilight."Extra," No Twilight! Yes, Twilight! Hey."Lucy, Hey.Tom Haverford, Thanks for coming.Lucy, I only have a second.Lucy, I have to get to work.Tom Haverford, Bella's going on her first hunt.Tom Haverford, I just don't get why you broke up with me.Tom Haverford," Is it 'cause I'm not cool enough? Like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob type situation, where you like me but there's someone else you like more?"Lucy,Uh It's nothing to do with Twilight. It just didn't work out.Tom Haverford," Okay? Well, what difference does it make? If we stayed together, you probably would have just dumped me for Ron."Lucy," Actually, that's the reason."Lucy," I believe you when you say that you're not in love with Wendy anymore, but you're definitely not cool with her dating Ron."Lucy, You talk about it constantly.Tom Haverford," Well, I can't help it, okay? I mean, he's so manly, and he's my boss."Tom Haverford," Imagine if your boss was Angelina Jolie, and then one day, she just started dating your ex-boyfriend."Tom Haverford, Wouldn't that freak you out a little bit?Lucy,"Well, not if I had a great new boyfriend, dumbass."Lucy," Look, Tom, I like you."Lucy," You're really cute and you're funny, and you're small enough for me to throw you around."Lucy," So if you ever work through this, then give me a call."Extra," My grandmother lived in Pawnee for 60 years, and I wanna put her ashes in the time capsule."Extra," My cat, Turnip, was the greatest cat ever, and I'd like to put his ashes in the time capsule."Leslie Knope," For the last time, and I won't say this again, there will be no human or feline ashes in either one of the time capsules."Extra, Except for Turnip! Except for Turnip! No chanting.Extra," Look, we don't know what the world is going to be like in 50 years."Extra, We could all have been wiped out from disease or the flu.Leslie Knope, So what's your suggestion? I don't know.Extra, I'm just scared.April Ludgate, Hey.Andy Dwyer," Aw! Andy! I got two microphones, a four-track recorder and every bass tab to Dave Matthews ever."Andy Dwyer," We're gonna jam for, like, nine hours."Andy Dwyer, Is that cool? Yeah.Andy Dwyer, All right.Extra, That's ridiculous.Extra," Now, why should the Bill of Rights be in the official time capsule, but this painting of my dog is in time capsule seven? Well, I think pet paintingslashes are in time capsule four."Extra," No, that's baseball cards."Leslie Knope," No, baseball cards are in time capsule nine, childhood memorabilia."Kelly Larson," Honestly, Twilight could go in almost any of these categories."Extra," Oh, shut up, Kelly! Make me, Bob! Okay, let's take a 10-minute break! Oh, God."Leslie Knope, This time capsule's tearing this town apart.Leslie Knope, You're leaving soon.Leslie Knope, Can I blame it on you in the press? Sure.Ben Wyatt," Well, I gotta say, I think it's kind of impressive."Ben Wyatt, I've been to a lot of towns.Ben Wyatt, Usually people don't care about anything.Ben Wyatt," I mean, don't get me wrong."Ben Wyatt," These people are weirdoes, but they're weirdoes who care."Leslie Knope," Excuse me, everyone."Leslie Knope," I realize things have gotten a little out of control, and that's Ben's fault, and he's sorry."Leslie Knope," But I have an idea, and if you like it, I think we can end this right now."Leslie Knope," ""Dear Pawnee of the future, ""congratulations."Leslie Knope," ""You have found a time capsule that was buried over 50 years ago."Leslie Knope," ""We wanted to include a collection of items that would best represent ""what life was like in our town at that moment."Leslie Knope," ""Instead, you'll find only one item, ""a video recording of a public forum we held ""in order to determine just what those items would be."Leslie Knope," ""This is truly what life was like."Leslie Knope," ""A lot of people with a lot of opinions ""arguing passionately for what they believed in."Leslie Knope," ""So enjoy watching it, assuming you still have electricity."Leslie Knope," ""And sorry about the weird blank gap in the middle."Leslie Knope," ""A man named Jerry Gergich screwed up the recording somehow."Leslie Knope," ""He had one job to do."Leslie Knope," ""Sincerely, Pawnee of the past."Andy Dwyer,""" Is Eduardo coming?"April Ludgate,"No, he went back to Venezuela."Andy Dwyer," Oh, that sucks."Andy Dwyer, He was a really good bassist.Andy Dwyer, I was actually starting to like him.April Ludgate, I know.April Ludgate, That's what made me start to hate him.Andy Dwyer, Hey.Andy Dwyer, Nice and band totally worked.Ann Perkins," Have you enjoyed your time with Andy? Yeah, he's great."Chris Traeger, And he told me how great you are.Chris Traeger, And he told me that I would be crazy to let you get away.Ann Perkins," He did, huh? He did."Chris Traeger," And also, there is a pretzel stand over there that serves, literally, the best pretzel I've ever had."Chris Traeger, Would you like one? Absolutely.Tom Haverford," Hey, guys."Everyone," Hey, Tom."Leslie Knope, Tom.Tom Haverford," Listen, I've never seen this before, so I'd really appreciate it if no one, like, talked or texted or anything."Tom Haverford, Okay.Leslie Knope, Ooh!

bastard!Leslie Knope,Wait.Leslie Knope,How do you know?Ann Perkins,I don't have any actual proof.Leslie Knope,Then I'm sure he's not cheating on you.Leslie Knope,"And if he is, he's a monster."Leslie Knope,"And if he's not, you guys are great together."Leslie Knope,"But if he is, I will kill him."Ann Perkins,"Well, we had a really good conversation about our relationship last

Wyatt,Something totally different.Ben Wyatt,Probably go home and grab something.Tom Haverford,Cool.Leslie Knope,"If you would be willing to just take a brief pit stop, we could see Indiana's secondlargest rocking chair."Ron Swanson,No.Leslie Knope,Then maybe we should take a quick twohour sojourn to Dame Gervin's Misshapen Celebrity Castle.Leslie Knope,"It's where Madame Tussaud sends all of its failed wax figures, and if you can figure out who it is, you get to take it home."Ron Swanson,No.Leslie Knope,"What's wrong with you, grouchy pants?"Ron Swanson,I've been fasting all day to save room for Mulligan's.Leslie Knope,"Fasting's not healthy for you, Ron."Ron Swanson,"Leslie, you need to understand, we are heading for the most special place on earth."Ron Swanson,"When I'm done eating a Mulligan's meal, for weeks afterwards, there are flecks of meat in my mustache, and I refuse to clean it because, every now and then, a piece of meat will fall into my mouth."Leslie Knope,"I forgot to tell you, Chris Traeger is joining us for dinner tonight."Ron Swanson,Please tell me he's meeting us at the restaurant.Leslie Knope,"No, we are picking him up."Ron Swanson,"Damn

just Wow!Leslie Knope,Look at your foyer.Leslie Knope,It's like a spa in here.Chris Traeger,Exactly.Chris Traeger,The entranceway to your house sends a message to the world about who you are.Chris Traeger,And the front door provides energy flow and opportunity.Chris Traeger,You cannot limit that.Leslie Knope,Yeah.Leslie Knope,Ron doesn't even have a front door.Leslie Knope,He won't even tell me his address.Leslie Knope,Ask him where he lives.Chris Traeger,Where do you live?Ron Swanson,Why?Leslie Knope,So this is some kind of coat closet or something?Leslie Knope,"Wow, there's a lot of men's coats in here."Chris Traeger,I like coats.Leslie Knope,Could I use your bathroom really quick?Chris Traeger,It's right behind you.Leslie Knope,Okay.Leslie Knope,Toilet seat's up.Andy Dwyer,"Hey, let me get a beer and a Pawnee Sunrise."Extra,Do you wanna pay cash or start a tab?Andy Dwyer,I It's okay I know Tom.Extra,Tom who?Andy Dwyer,Tom Hammen

Knope,"Hey, I think you might be right."Leslie Knope,I found a woman's razor in Chris's shower and a pink swimming cap.Ann Perkins,Are you serious?Ann Perkins,What the hell?Leslie Knope,"You know, it could be nothing, but it feels like something."Ann Perkins,I don't I'm coming up there.Leslie Knope,Wait.Leslie Knope,"All right, okay."Chris Traeger,"All right, let's go."Ron Swanson,"Oh, my God."Ron Swanson,"They just forgot to unlock the door, that's all."Leslie Knope,"Ron, it looks like they're closed for some kind of health code violation."Leslie Knope,"Ron, stop it!"Leslie Knope,Ron?Ron Swanson,They just boarded her up like she was some common warehouse.Ron Swanson,I should have been here.Ron Swanson,What happened to the steaks that were in there when they closed?Ron Swanson,Do you think they got eaten?Chris Traeger,Why don't we go back to my place and I'll fire up the grill?Leslie Knope,You sure you're not expecting company or something?Chris Traeger,No.Chris Traeger,"What do you say, Ron?"Chris Traeger,"Go back to my place, I'll make you some grub?"Chris Traeger,It'll be just as good as it would've been here.Ron Swanson,Okay.Chris Traeger,Okay.Tom Haverford,That man is a legend.Tom Haverford,Think about all the scents he's created.Tom Haverford,"Attack, Yearning, Thickening, Itch, Coma, Sideboob."Ben Wyatt,"Dennis Feinstein, though?"Ben Wyatt,I don't know.Ben Wyatt,He should probably change his name to something a little more exotic if he wants to make it big in perfume.Tom Haverford,"Oh, his real name is Dante Fiero, but he changed it to Dennis Feinstein 'cause that's way more exotic in Pawnee."Ben Wyatt,Okay.Ben Wyatt,So what's your plan?Tom Haverford,"Wait till he's alone, then I'll walk up and spray him with Tommy Fresh, and I say, "" Uhoh."Tom Haverford,"""Looks like you just inhaled your future."Ben Wyatt,""" Yeah."Ben Wyatt,That might actually work.April Ludgate,Is everything okay?Andy Dwyer,"It kind of sucks that I'm super broke and I wanna buy you stuff and it's embarrassing that I can't, but I'm broke too, and I don't want anything."April Ludgate,I just wanna hang out with you.April Ludgate,"Plus, I can get free drinks any time I want."Andy Dwyer,How?April Ludgate,I'm a girl in a sleazy club.April Ludgate,Hey.Extra,Hey.April Ludgate,I hate drinking

so they can have it out.Ron Swanson,Ask her to bring some garlic salt.Ron Swanson,I'm worried Chris doesn't have any.April Ludgate,I got this from a waiter.April Ludgate,I told him I had a pork

Swanson,Before postage.Ron Swanson,Are we done?Tom Haverford,"What do JayZ, Lil Wayne, and Drake all have in common?"Jerry Gergich,"Oh, I know this one."Jerry Gergich,They are all rappists.Tom Haverford,"Oh, my God."Jerry Gergich,"They're rappers, Jerry."Tom Haverford,And what they have in common is none of them have ever performed in Pawnee.Tom Haverford,Why?Tom Haverford,Because we don't have an adequate concert venue.Tom Haverford,Until now.Tom Haverford,The Pawnee Amphitheater.Ann Perkins,How much would that cost?Tom Haverford,Not that much.Tom Haverford,"$200, $300 million."Ann Perkins,Right.Leslie Knope,Great.Donna Meagle,Luxury dog park.Leslie Knope,Do you want to tell us any more?Donna Meagle,Poodles only.Donna Meagle,No pooping.April

there.Andy Dwyer,"Well, April is right here."Andy Dwyer,And I am down here somewhere.Ben Wyatt,How about we just invest the money?Ben Wyatt,Make 4% a year.Ben Wyatt,"You know, set up a nice little nest egg for the city."Ben Wyatt,What do you think?Tom Haverford,Great idea.Tom Haverford,"Thanks, white Urkel."Ben Wyatt,All right.Ben Wyatt,"Maybe it's not the sexiest idea, Tom, but it's smart."Tom Haverford,What are you even still doing here?Tom Haverford,Harvest Festival is over.Tom Haverford,Shouldn't you be back in Indianapolis?Leslie Knope,Hey.Leslie Knope,"Ben helped us launch the Harvest Festival, and he knows how Chris's mind works."Leslie Knope,And he's a valuable asset to the team.Ben Wyatt,Thank you.Leslie Knope,April has not presented her idea.Leslie Knope,April?April Ludgate,I didn't come up with anything.Leslie Knope,Why?April Ludgate,"Because I know that whatever we come up with isn't gonna be good enough anyway, and we're just gonna go with your idea."Ron Swanson,She's got a point.Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us what your idea is so I can go back to the Thunderdome."Tom Haverford,That's what I'm calling my tent.Leslie Knope,I am really disappointed in all of you.Leslie Knope,"You know, the whole town is looking at us right now."Leslie Knope,And you're letting 'em down.Leslie Knope,Take an hour.Leslie Knope,Go clear your heads and see if you can come up with a real idea that we can use.Leslie Knope,"And also, see if you're interested in contributing to this department."Leslie Knope,"Then, after that, I will tell you my idea."Ann Perkins,Wow.Ann Perkins,You really let 'em have it.Leslie Knope,"Well, I had no choice."Leslie Knope,I didn't wanna tell them my idea.Ann Perkins,Why not?Leslie Knope,Because I don't have one.Leslie Knope,"I don't have an idea, Ann."Leslie Knope,"I'm so screwed, Ann."Leslie Knope,"The meeting is tomorrow, and I don't have anything."Ann Perkins,Why not just build the park on the lot behind my house?Leslie Knope,Chris wants the new project to generate revenue.Ann Perkins,What about those binders in your office?Leslie Knope,They're filled with small ideas.Leslie Knope,"We need a big, juicy idea."Leslie Knope,"I'm so desperate, I even brought in my dream journal, hoping it would inspire me."Ann Perkins,"""I married ALF and we're pretty happy."Ann Perkins,""" That sounds nice."Leslie Knope,It was.Ann Perkins,"Okay, listen to me."Ann Perkins,"You are smart and creative and talented, and you're gonna be fine."Leslie Knope,You're probably right.Leslie Knope,I just need an hour and it'll come to me.Andy Dwyer,Hello?April Ludgate,"Andy, you have to save me."April Ludgate,I'm camping with people I work with.Andy Dwyer,Hello.Andy Dwyer,April.April Ludgate,Hello?Andy Dwyer,Walk around in circles like I am.Andy Dwyer,Help triangulate the phone call.Andy Dwyer,Hello?Andy Dwyer,Hang on.Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna try to get to higher ground.Andy Dwyer,I found some thorns.Jerry Gergich,"I mean, yes, my daughter might think she is old enough to be sexually active with her boyfriend."Jerry Gergich,"But I'm sorry, 16, that just seems too young to be on birth control."Jerry Gergich,"You know, I was 24 when Gayle took my virginity."Ron Swanson,What say we just stand here in silence and think of ideas for projects?Jerry Gergich,You know what I should do?Jerry Gergich,I should lead a teen abstinence workshop.Ron Swanson,That might be incredibly effective.Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Tom."Tom Haverford,One second.Tom Haverford,I'm just in the middle of a head massage.Tom Haverford,"Well, that's a good stopping point."Tom Haverford,What's up?Ben Wyatt,Uh You wanna bounce some ideas off each other?Tom Haverford,Here's a better idea.Tom Haverford,How about I bounce my way over to my dog couch and watch a little Season Six of Top Chef?Ben Wyatt,All right.Tom Haverford,I know Leslie seems upset.Tom Haverford,"But the truth is, she's better than us at this stuff by a thousand miles."Tom Haverford,"So, there's really no point."Tom Haverford,Care for some fondue?Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Ben Wyatt,Hey.Ben Wyatt,How do you afford all this stuff?Tom Haverford,I just return it the next day and claim it was defective.Tom Haverford,The key is crying a lot.Tom Haverford,No one likes to hear

sky is really beautiful.Leslie Knope,It's pollution from the Sweetums factory.Leslie Knope,"It's gorgeous, but is it worth the asthma?"Ben Wyatt,No.Leslie Knope,"Ben, this new project idea, it's not really a big deal."Leslie Knope,I'm probably making too much out of it.Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, no."Ben Wyatt,It's really big.Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you got everyone's attention with the Harvest Festival."Ben Wyatt,"Now, you're gonna seal the deal."Ben Wyatt,It's the chance you've been waiting for.Leslie Knope,"What if the festival was, like, a high point for me, and I never do anything better than that?"Ben Wyatt,Then you wouldn't be Leslie Knope.Leslie Knope,"So, I have to keep thinking about good ideas all the time, or I'm no longer myself?"Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no."Ben Wyatt,"No, no."Ben Wyatt,Not at all.Ben Wyatt,I've just honestly never met someone who works as hard as you do.Ben Wyatt,"I mean, you're like the Energizer Bunny of city government."Ron Swanson,"And when she looked in the back of her car, she saw that even though it was her own private property, she would be forced to take it in for a state inspection!"Leslie Knope,"Okay, guys."Leslie Knope,Listen up.Donna Meagle,What was that?Leslie Knope,That was me talking.April Ludgate,"No, I heard it, too."April Ludgate,Andy?Tom Haverford,"If that's a coyote, someone needs to pick me up off the ground now."Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God!"Chris Traeger,"Hey, guys."Ben Wyatt, What are you doing here?Chris Traeger," I was just out for my nighttime run, and I thought, ""Why not go visit the Parks Department?"" How's everything going here? Super great."Leslie Knope, Really well.Leslie Knope, We have a great idea.Chris Traeger, Tell me now while I sit on this boulder.Chris Traeger, I'm much more receptive to new ideas when my heart rate is still elevated.Ann Perkins," Chris, do you wanna maybe just talk for a minute? Let them work? Oh! Sure."Andy Dwyer, What was that? What was that? Tom Haverford,"Leslie, just tell us your idea."Tom Haverford," Los Angeles, Season One isn't gonna watch itself."Leslie Knope, Here it is.Leslie Knope, What do you think?

Haverford,That's not fair.Tom Haverford,You shouldn't have led me to believe it was a beautiful woman.Ben Wyatt,I didn't.Ben Wyatt,I've been staying at the Pawnee Super Suites Motel for seven months.Ben Wyatt,"It's a charming little inn with wonderfully random wakeup calls, delightfully unstable temperatures, and, as of yesterday, bedbugs."Ben Wyatt,"""Four stars,"" says nobody."Tom Haverford,"I wish I could help you, Benihana, but I can't."Tom Haverford,I have a one bedroom.Tom Haverford,I can't have a dude sleeping on my couch if and when I bring home a lady.Tom Haverford,"I

free electricity as you want.Andy Dwyer,It's free.April Ludgate,Couple more rules.April Ludgate,"If you ever watch a sad movie, you have to wear mascara so we can see whether or not you've been crying."April Ludgate,"There's no noise allowed on Mondays, and no TV after breakfast."Andy Dwyer,She is lying again.Ben Wyatt,She is.Andy Dwyer,Yes.Ben Wyatt,Because it's hard to tell.Andy Dwyer,No.Andy Dwyer,"We leave the TV on all day long so burglars think that we're home when we're not, which was my idea that I'm trying to patent."Andy Dwyer,"So, you want to move in tonight?"Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Ben Wyatt,Sure.Ben Wyatt,That would be great.April Ludgate,You want my gum?Andy Dwyer,Uhhuh.Leslie Knope,"Ron, can you make the opening remarks?"Leslie Knope,I'm just I'm not in the mood.Ron Swanson,Neither am I.Ron Swanson,Ever.Ron Swanson,What's wrong with you?Ron Swanson,You live for this kind of stuff.Leslie Knope,I don't have it in me right now.Leslie Knope,"Ron,

of Nature."Ron Swanson,""" This room has several paintings in it."Ron Swanson,Some are big.Ron Swanson,Some are small.Ron Swanson,"People did them, and they are here now."Ron Swanson,"I believe that after this is over, they'll be hung in government buildings."Ron Swanson,Why the government is involved in an art show is beyond me.Ron Swanson,I also think it's pointless for a human to paint scenes of nature when they can just go outside and stand in it.Ron Swanson,"Anyway, please do not misinterpret the fact that I am talking right now as genuine interest in art and attempt to discuss it with me further."Ron Swanson,End of speech.Andy Dwyer,And that's the TV room.Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, it's a mess."April Ludgate,Can you throw that in the trash can?Ben Wyatt,"I was just here, like, three weeks ago for your wedding."Ben Wyatt,What happened?April Ludgate,"Well, Burly moved out."April Ludgate,He was the one that did all the cleaning and throwing away and stuff.Ben Wyatt,"Wait, he moved out, like, a week ago."Ben Wyatt,You guys made this mess in a week?Andy Dwyer,"Well, I always think April's going to clean up."April Ludgate,And I never clean up.Andy Dwyer,"It's cute, right?"Ben Wyatt,No.April Ludgate,"Yes, it is."Ben Wyatt,Are you guys frying marbles?Andy Dwyer,We were checking to see if the fire alarm worked.April Ludgate,It doesn't.Andy Dwyer,The biggest challenge to picking the perfect roommate is finding someone who's willing to pay more than their share of rent without knowing it.April Ludgate,I think we found that in Ben.Ron Swanson,"You forgot to paint a painting, son."Jerry Gergich,"So, for my painting, I chose one of my very favorite Greek myths, the centaur goddess, Dyaphena, slaying a great stag."Ann Perkins,It's stunning.Tom Haverford,"It's breathtaking, Jerry."Donna Meagle,Yeah.Donna Meagle,It really is.Jerry Gergich,Wow.Jerry Gergich,"Thanks, guys."Ann Perkins,"Hey, Leslie, you should really come over here and look at Jerry's painting."Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."Leslie Knope,That's me.Leslie Knope,Is that me?Jerry Gergich,What?Jerry Gergich,No.Jerry Gergich,"Geez, it does look like you."Leslie Knope,You're just realizing that now?Tom Haverford,"That's what you see when you close your eyes at night, Jerry."Tom Haverford,Topless Leslie glued to a horse.Jerry Gergich,Okay.Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, I am just so, so sorry."Jerry Gergich,"Dyaphena, she is this powerful goddess, and I've been thinking a lot about powerful women, and subconsciously, I painted you."Jerry Gergich,I'm sorry.Jerry Gergich,I'm going to take it right down.Leslie Knope,No.Leslie Knope,Leave it up.Leslie Knope,I love it.Leslie Knope,I don't know how to explain it.Leslie Knope,"Every time I look at it, I just think to myself, ""What can't that centaur woman do?"Leslie Knope,"""Besides ride an escalator and drive a car."Leslie Knope,""" Art can be so magnificent."Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."Ann Perkins,The baby is Tom.Tom Haverford,What?Ann Perkins,This is easily my favorite painting ever.Tom Haverford,"What the hell, Jerry?"Tom Haverford,Look at my pot belly.Tom Haverford,I look like a pregnant baby.Tom Haverford,And why am I so scared?Tom Haverford,"All right, we've got to take this down."Tom Haverford,Now.Leslie Knope,"No, this painting isn't going anywhere, Tom."Leslie Knope,It's staying right here.Leslie Knope,"Hello, fellow lover of the arts."Leslie Knope,Welcome to the painting.Extra,"What, is that you?"Extra,"Well, it's hot."Leslie Knope,Thank you.Ann Perkins,"This guy's in it, too."Ann Perkins,He's the little fat baby.Extra,Cool.Leslie Knope,Yeah.Ann Perkins,What's going on right here?Tom Haverford,Baby rolls!Tom Haverford,We've been trying to get that light fixed for months.Tom Haverford,Thank you.Extra,Thank her.Leslie Knope,"Good morning, Tom."Extra,She marched into my office this morning and told me she wouldn't leave until I got this done.Tom Haverford,Hmm.Tom Haverford,"Well, I'm glad someone's feeling good."Tom Haverford,They're going to hang that painting in a public building where anybody can see it.Tom Haverford,"In one brush stroke, Jerry has killed the JayZ vibe that's taken me years to cultivate and replaced it with the fat, brown baby vibe, which is not as cool of a vibe."Donna Meagle,"Hey, Aphrodite."Donna Meagle,Chris needs you in his office.Leslie Knope,Hmm.Leslie Knope,"When you're done with the light, fix the printer."Extra,I don't know how to fix printers.Leslie Knope,Learn it.Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, should I go, too?"Leslie Knope,"This isn't about you, Jerry."Jerry Gergich,It's my painting.Marcia Langman,Why am I upset?Marcia Langman,Let's start with governmentfunded animal porn.Leslie Knope,I'm not sure that's fair.Marcia Langman,"I want it destroyed, and I want a statement from this office apologizing for an obscene depiction of bestiality."Leslie Knope,Bestiality?Leslie Knope,"It is a picture of a centaur, a beautiful half person, half horse."Marcia Langman,And how did it get like that?Marcia Langman,Who had sex with what and gave birth to which?Chris Traeger,"Ms. Langman, we hear you, we understand you and we are going to do whatever we can to come to a solution."Marcia Langman,Destroy it.Leslie Knope,Destroy it?Leslie Knope,"I mean, is she serious?"Leslie Knope,Do you find this personally offensive?Chris Traeger,"Not personally, no."Chris Traeger,"No, personally, I enjoy a good artistic depiction of the human form."Chris Traeger,I've dabbled in nude sculpture.Chris Traeger,I've posed nude.Chris Traeger,"In college, I was in a nude production of Cats."Chris Traeger,"But I am not in the nude now, am I?"Chris Traeger,Because we're in a government building.Chris Traeger,"And that would be inappropriate, which is what I think Marcia is saying."Chris Traeger,"So, take care of this situation."Leslie Knope,That painting is not going to be destroyed.Leslie Knope,Every great work of art contains a message.Leslie Knope,"And the message of this painting is, ""Get out of my way unless you want an arrow in your ass, Marcia."""Andy Dwyer," Morning, roomie."Andy Dwyer,How did you sleep?Ben Wyatt,"Well, there were no bedbugs."Ben Wyatt,"Also, no bed."Ben Wyatt,I'm going to go buy a bed.Andy Dwyer,Fork.Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.Ben Wyatt,Are you eating turkey chili off of a frisbee?Andy Dwyer,Yeah.Andy Dwyer,"It's pretty cute, right?"Ben Wyatt,No.Andy Dwyer,"Do you know what ""cute"" means?"April Ludgate,What have you got against turkey chili for breakfast?Ben Wyatt,What have you guys got against washing dishes?April Ludgate,"We don't have any dishes, okay?"April Ludgate,Burly took them all when he left.April Ludgate,"Now, I bet you feel like a jerk."Ben Wyatt,God.Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I might need to not stay here anymore."Andy Dwyer,No.Andy Dwyer,"Sorry, dude."Andy Dwyer,We already spent your money on a new Xbox 360 and more frisbees to eat off of.Andy Dwyer,You've got to stay.Ben Wyatt,God.Ben Wyatt,Okay.Ben Wyatt,All right.Ben Wyatt,Here's the deal.Ben Wyatt,We're going to clean this place up.Ben Wyatt,Okay?Ben Wyatt,"And then, I am going to teach you how to be adults."Andy Dwyer,Cool.Andy Dwyer,We'll get to be adults.April Ludgate,"Gee, golly."April Ludgate,"Thanks, mister."Andy Dwyer,Fork.Perd Hapley,Hello.Perd Hapley,"I'm Perd Hapley, and welcome to Ya' Heard?"Perd Hapley,With Perd.Perd Hapley,Today's show begins now.Perd Hapley,Is this art or is it pornography?Perd Hapley,"Here to answer this question is Parks and Recreation Deputy Director, Leslie Knope."Leslie Knope,"Perd, it is a beautiful work of art."Leslie Knope,"Governments should not be in the business of censorship, especially when a painting is as awesome as this one."Perd Hapley,But this is where the controversy of this story gets even more controversial.Perd Hapley,You are the subject of this painting.Perd Hapley,"Half woman, half horse, with what some would say are human breasts."Leslie Knope,I am not the subject.Leslie Knope,The subject is strong and empowered women everywhere.Leslie Knope,But it does look a little bit like me.Perd Hapley,"Leslie, for our viewers at home who might not know, are centaurs real?"Leslie Knope,No.Perd Hapley,Absolutely sure?Ben Wyatt,Okay.Ben Wyatt,"So, you always separate your lights from your darks."April Ludgate,That's racist.Ben Wyatt,"And then, you get your laundry Where is your laundry detergent?"Andy Dwyer,Right.Andy Dwyer,Here we are.Ben Wyatt,Okay.Ben Wyatt,This is bubble bath.Ben Wyatt,You guys You wash your clothes in bubble bath?Andy Dwyer,"Bubble bath, clothes soap, same thing."Ben Wyatt,"No, it's not."Andy Dwyer,"Well, they both make bubbles, so"Leslie Knope,It was never our intention to offend anyone I guess some people object to powerful depictions of awesome ladies.Perd Hapley,Okay.Perd Hapley,Also joining us today is a different person.Perd Hapley,"Pornographic film actress, Brandi Maxxxx."Brandi Maxxxx, Pleasure to be here.Perd Hapley," Brandi, you've starred in over 200 adult films, some of which are very good."Perd Hapley, When did you get into the business?Brandi Maxxxx,Last year.Perd Hapley, Fantastic.Perd Hapley," Now, this painting right here, art or pornography?"Brandi Maxxxx,"Perd, I think this whole debate is ridiculous."Brandi Maxxxx, What Leslie and I do is obviously art.Leslie Knope, Hang on.Leslie Knope, There is a big difference between an oil painting of a Greek myth and a pornographic movie.Brandi Maxxxx," It's okay, Leslie."Brandi Maxxxx, I got this one.Brandi Maxxxx, What? What Leslie and I want people to know is you should be able to have sex anywhere you want and show it anywhere you want.Brandi Maxxxx," Whether it's girl-on-girl action, bondage, or Yep."Brandi Maxxxx, what have you.Leslie Knope, Okay.Leslie Knope, Hang on.Leslie Knope, Pornography is very difficult to define.Leslie Knope," In fact, it was Justice Stewart who once said, ""I can't define pornography, but I know it when I see it."Perd Hapley,""" Brandi, how would you define pornography?"Brandi Maxxxx,"For me, it's when the penis goes in."Ben Wyatt," All right, we need to do some basic organization."Ben Wyatt, Where do you put your bills when they come?April Ludgate, I read the magazines and give the rest to Andy.Andy Dwyer, Which I organize into a pile or stack that I put into the freezer.Ben Wyatt, Why?Andy Dwyer,So they won't get lost.Andy Dwyer, Bingo.Ben Wyatt," Okay, you have to pay these."Ben Wyatt, Good thing I didn't lose them.Ben Wyatt, Okay.Ben Wyatt, New lesson.Ben Wyatt, Basic finance.Ben Wyatt, I'm gonna teach you how to balance a checkbook.Ben Wyatt, Okay.Ben Wyatt, I am going to teach you how to open a bank account.Andy Dwyer, Bank account.Andy Dwyer, Good.Tom Haverford," Brandi, I'm Thomas Haverford."Tom Haverford, I just wanted to say I thought you made some excellent points up there.Tom Haverford, I totally agree with you that people should be allowed to have sex in public places.Brandi Maxxxx, You look familiar to me.Tom Haverford, Maybe you've seen me down at the Snakehole Lounge.Tom Haverford, I'm a part-owner there.Brandi Maxxxx, That's you.Brandi Maxxxx, In the painting.Brandi Maxxxx, You're the fat baby.Brandi Maxxxx, Aw! That's so cute.Tom Haverford, Oh.Tom Haverford, You're into that?Brandi Maxxxx,No.Tom Haverford," Damn it, Jerry."Chris Traeger, Imagine my horror.Chris Traeger, I'm hanging upside down with my gravity boots watching Perd.Chris Traeger," I see you with your painting, and I am startled and disappointed."Leslie Knope," Well, I did not know that Brandi was going to offer me a role in her next film."Chris Traeger, I urge you not to take that role.Leslie Knope, I am not going to take the role.Chris Traeger," That's good to hear, because recently, you've been a little unpredictable."Leslie Knope, I'm sorry that I'm trying to defend a beautiful work of art.Jerry Gergich," Thank you, Leslie."Leslie Knope," Stand down, Jerry."Leslie Knope, This isn't your fight.Chris Traeger, You've left me no choice.Chris Traeger," I have convened a meeting of the Public Arts Commission, and we will abide by their decision."Leslie Knope, Fine with me.Leslie Knope, Public Arts Commission.Leslie Knope, Filled with hippies who love art and sometimes weed.Leslie Knope, Jackpot.Chris Traeger,I would just like to introduce myself.Chris Traeger,"My name is Chris Traeger, and I am a big fan of art."Tom Haverford,"Council, I am not opposed to pornography."Tom Haverford,"In fact, you could say I'm definitely for it."Tom Haverford,"If I had my laptop right now, I would show you a well-hidden folder with gigabytes of proof."Tom Haverford,"However, this thing is disgusting and wrong."Extra,Please let the record reflect that the fat baby is referring to the painting.Tom Haverford,"Hey, I am not a fat baby."Tom Haverford,"I'm a small, slender man, similar to actor Taye Diggs."Tom Haverford,So let the record reflect that.Tom Haverford,That I look like Tay Diggs.Leslie Knope,"Members of the Public Art Commission, good afternoon and good art."Leslie Knope,Every great society has always supported artistic expression.Leslie Knope,The Romans.Marcia Langman,Perverts.Leslie Knope,The Greeks.Marcia Langman,Gay perverts.Leslie Knope,Two great societies in Europe.Marcia Langman,Europeans.Leslie Knope,"There are some members of this community that would like to demonize this painting, and when they do they in fact demonize art itself."Leslie Knope,What is or isn't art is up to every free thinking American to decide on their own.Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's in the bag."Leslie Knope,We've decided that the painting should be destroyed.Tom Haverford,"Yeah, burn it."Leslie Knope,What are you serious?Leslie Knope,You're supposed to be in favor of public art.Extra,"Yeah but there's nipples in it, so I figure we ought to be safe and destroy it."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, here is a list of errands and things that human adults need."Ben Wyatt,"Also, I'm giving you an advance on next month's rent, and I want you guys to go to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and get everything on that list."April Ludgate,Or we can buy a Wii.Ben Wyatt,You can handle this.Andy Dwyer,"I don't know man, why don't you just handle it?"Ben Wyatt,"No, I can't, I have a date."April Ludgate,What's his name?Ben Wyatt,"It's actually not, Chris set it up."Ben Wyatt,Never mind.Ben Wyatt,"Point is, stick to the list and you'll do great."Ben Wyatt,I have total faith in you.Ben Wyatt,There's like a 30% chance they'll both die.Marcia Langman,So how do you want to do this?Marcia Langman,Burn it publicly or burn it privately and I put the footage on my blogLeslie Knope,"You've made your point, okay"Leslie Knope,Look this painting is very important to meLeslie Knope,"It doesn't need to hang in a government building, just let me take it home and I'll keep it there."Leslie Knope,What do you say?Marcia Langman,"I say, this painting is going to burn."Marcia Langman,"First here, then in hell."Marcia Langman,Do I need to get this validated?Leslie Knope,I don't know.Marcia Langman,"Okay, I'll just pull my car around and you can load it in the back."Leslie Knope,No.Marcia Langman,"Hey, come back here."Leslie Knope,"Make me stag, I am Diaphena."Andy Dwyer,This place is amazing.April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have a thing that makes sherbet, we need five of those."Andy Dwyer,"No, we need to stick with what's on the list."Andy Dwyer,"First things first, oven mitts."Andy Dwyer,Where are the oven mitts?April Ludgate,"Oh my god, they have all the as seen on TV stuff."April Ludgate,Shake weight.April Ludgate,Iron gym.April Ludgate,Miracle hand repair.April Ludgate,Big top cookie.April Ludgate,Pillow pet.April Ludgate,Slap chop.April Ludgate,Oh my god a gopher pick upAndy Dwyer,"Honey listen to me, get it all."Andy Dwyer,"Grab everything that we've seen on TV, put it in this cart right now."Andy Dwyer,"Iron gym, I am going to get so buff."April Ludgate,"Oh my god, marshmallow shooter"Andy Dwyer,"Marshmallow shooter, get two."April Ludgate,Wait what about the magic bullet?Andy Dwyer,"Yeah, I've seen that."Leslie Knope,"Oh, hi."Ben Wyatt,Hi.Leslie Knope,"I was at a meeting around the corner and some people wanted to destroy this painting, so I brought it here."Leslie Knope,Where is Andy and April?Ben Wyatt,They're out shopping.Leslie Knope,What are you doing here?Ben Wyatt,I moved into the spare room.Leslie Knope,"Really, huh"Leslie Knope,Can I come in?Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, yeah sure of course."Ben Wyatt,Why do they want to destroy it.Leslie Knope,Well it's a painting of me as a centaur.Ben Wyatt,Okay.Leslie Knope,And it's a nude.Ben Wyatt,Oh.Leslie Knope,"Just basically like the chestal region, mostly."Leslie Knope,You don't have to look at it if you don't want to.Ben Wyatt,No no no.Leslie Knope,It's very classy.Ben Wyatt,"yeah no, I'm sure it is."Leslie Knope,"Oh man it's chris, I'm gonna take this."Leslie Knope,Hi Chris.Chris Traeger,"Leslie Knope, you need to bring that painting back."Leslie Knope,What painting?Chris Traeger,"Leslie, you have the painting, and you need to bring it back in."Chris Traeger,"I think I've been pretty fair with you, and I'm beginning to feel angry."Chris Traeger,"and I don't like feeling angry, my heart is racing, it's going at literally 45 beats per minute."Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry, if I could just explain to you my point of view."Chris Traeger,"You will bring that painting in tomorrow morning, and surrender it to Marcia Langman, and that's that."Chris Traeger,Do you understand me madam?April Ludgate,Mighty Putty.Andy Dwyer,What are we doing?Andy Dwyer,We didn't get a single thing that Ben told us to.April Ludgate,Sure we did.April Ludgate,We got the marshmallow shooter.Andy Dwyer,I don't think that's on the list.April Ludgate,But I want it.Andy Dwyer,I want it too.Andy Dwyer,But I also kind of want my own fork.Andy Dwyer,"Because you eat really slow, which is cute, but also super annoying."April Ludgate,Fine.Andy Dwyer,"What, what's wrong?"April Ludgate,"Nothing, it's just adults are boring, and I hate them, and I don't want to buy all this stupid boring adult stuff and become boring adults."Andy Dwyer,"Hey listen to me, yes we're going to get a dish rack and shower curtains and a cutting board"Andy Dwyer,but if you think for one seond I'm not also going to get that marshmallow shooter so I can shoot you in the face with marshmallows while you sleepAndy Dwyer,then you're the dumbest woman I know.April Ludgate,You're going to make me cry.Leslie Knope,You're a levelheaded person.Leslie Knope,What do I do here?Ben Wyatt,"I don't know, it is one of the basic rules of government that you shouldn't offend people."Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I guess you're right."Leslie Knope,I'm so annoyed by all these rules lately.Ben Wyatt,Me too.April Ludgate,Come back here.Andy Dwyer,"Hey Leslie, what are you doing here?"Leslie Knope,"Well, I stole a painting, and I was hoping you guys would help me hide it."Andy Dwyer,"I like it, it's very simple."Leslie Knope,No it's on the other side.April Ludgate,"Oh my God, is that you as a naked horse."Leslie Knope,Does that look like me I don't evenAndy Dwyer,"Leslie, not to be inappropriate or anything, because you're my boss and my friend, but I would totally hit that."April Ludgate,So would I.Leslie Knope,You guys are sweet.Leslie Knope,"Okay, I should go, hit the road with this and oh"Ben Wyatt,OkayLeslie Knope,I'll see you later.April Ludgate,Bye.Andy Dwyer,Bye Leslie.Ben Wyatt,"So, how did we do?"Andy Dwyer,"I don't know, does this answer your question."Ben Wyatt,"No, did you buy plates"Andy Dwyer,Oh plates.Jerry Gergich,Leslie what are you doing?Leslie Knope,"Say goodbye to Diaphena, I have to turn her over to stupid Marcia Langman."Jerry Gergich,"Really, wow."Leslie Knope,What?Jerry Gergich,I mean to be honest that seems like the kind of thing I would do and I didn't think you would give in.Leslie Knope,Come with me.Ben Wyatt,Hey man.Andy Dwyer,"Roomie, dude, super fun to eat cereal from a bowl with a spoon."Andy Dwyer,Thank you for that.Ben Wyatt,No problem.Ben Wyatt,Though you know you're not supposed to bring your dishes into work right.Ben Wyatt,I'm serious.Andy Dwyer,What's going on between you and Leslie?Andy Dwyer,I noticed a weird vibe when we came into the room.Ben Wyatt,"Nothing, we're friends, just regular friendship development."Andy Dwyer,"Come on, roomie, you can tell me, I bet there's something."Andy Dwyer,I bet you I can guess what it is.Andy Dwyer,She stole money from you.Ben Wyatt,"What, no, no, Andy."Ben Wyatt,She did not.Ben Wyatt,I think we like each other.Ben Wyatt,"But Chris has this very strict rule, coworkers can't date."Ben Wyatt,So it's not even an option.Andy Dwyer,Wow.Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Andy Dwyer,"Well first of all, Leslie, she's like the coolest ever, you've chosen well."Andy Dwyer,"and secondly, if it's going to happen, it's going to happen."Andy Dwyer,"Look at me and April, if you're anything like us, three weeks from now, you'll be married my friend."Marcia Langman,"I'm glad you finally came to your senses, I'm sure that's not

free to destroy it.Tom Haverford,No.Leslie Knope,But I think you'll find no one could possibly be offended.Leslie Knope,Unless of course they have a problem with centaurs having modern

It's your birthday, and I know when it is Ron refuses to tell anyone when his birthday is."Leslie Knope,He's even had it redacted on all government documents.Leslie Knope,"Three years of investigations, phone calls, Freedom of Information Act requests, and still, I had nothing, until a wellplaced bribe to a gentleman at BaskinRobbins revealed Ron's birthday is on Friday."Ron Swanson,Damn it.Ron Swanson,I was so careful.Leslie Knope,"Well, you blew it."Leslie Knope,All for a free scoop of Rum Raisin.Leslie Knope,"Was it worth it, Ron?"Leslie Knope,Was it?Ron Swanson,I command you to do nothing.Leslie Knope,I'm not gonna do nothing.Leslie Knope,I'm gonna do something.Leslie Knope,And it's gonna be really big.Leslie Knope,I have a lot of years to make up for.Ron Swanson,"I don't like loud noises and people making a fuss, and I especially don't like people celebrating because they know a piece of private information about me."Ron Swanson,"Plus, the whole thing is a scam."Ron Swanson,Birthdays were invented by Hallmark to sell cards.Tom Haverford,They put up a fence.Leslie Knope,Who?Leslie Knope,No!Ben Wyatt,What's that?Leslie Knope,"There's a small park on the line between Pawnee and Eagleton, and"Tom Haverford,Last night Eagleton put up a fence around their side to keep us disgusting Pawnee hobos off their precious land.Tom Haverford,There's even a security guard.Tom Haverford,You got to show Eagleton I.D. to get in.Donna Meagle,Eagleton is a bunch of rich snobs.Donna Meagle,And that's coming from someone who has a Mercedes.Donna Meagle,With a Harman Kardon Logic surround sound system.Ben Wyatt,Who builds a fence to keep kids out of a playground?Leslie Knope,"Three words, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."Andy Dwyer,Who?Leslie Knope,Lindsay Carlisle Shay and I used to be best friends.Leslie Knope,We worked together at the Pawnee Parks Department.Leslie Knope,"Then she went to work in Eagleton and ""fixed her deviated septum"" and lost 35 pounds and lost something else."Leslie Knope,What was it again?Leslie Knope,"Oh, yeah."Leslie Knope,Her soul.Ben Wyatt,Is the Eagleton side really that much better than the Pawnee side?Leslie Knope,"To be fair, yeah."Leslie Knope,Our side is this scrappy piece of land where kids go to smash fluorescent light tubes.Leslie Knope,But it has a lot of heart.April Ludgate,That's what people always say when something sucks.Leslie Knope,"We should stand up for our town, okay?"Leslie Knope,"Pawneeans are just as good as Eagletonians, although on average, we are several inches shorter and 80 pounds heavier."Tom Haverford,People in Eagleton are straight up mean to us.Tom Haverford,I would never set foot over there.Tom Haverford,"But it's the only place that I can get my Bumble and Bumble hair care products, so I'm there every eight days."Leslie Knope,"Okay, well, I am on ""Operation No More Fence,"" so I'm putting you in charge of ""Operation Ron's Party, colon, Shock And Awe."April Ludgate,""" I am all over it."Leslie Knope,I just need you to do what's on that list.Ron Swanson,Leslie has a lot of qualities I find horrifying.Ron Swanson,But the worst one by far is how thoughtful she can be.Extra,It's the only park in our neighborhood.Extra,"I mean, where are my kids supposed to play, the rock quarry?"Extra,There's rocks in there.Extra,Why don't we just set fire to the fence?Extra,"You know, set it ablaze."Leslie Knope,That's arson.Extra,"Well, let's leave that up to the lawyers."Extra,"The point is, it would work."Extra,Why don't we build a fence around their fence?Extra,Why?Extra,"It would give us two fences, so if they needed to get to their fence for maintenance and whatnot, their pants might get caught."Extra,"My son Joey tried to scale that fence to play on the Eagleton side, and he fell and hurt his arm."Extra,You need to get those people to tear that fence down.Leslie Knope,This woman's right.Leslie Knope,"I promise you, citizens of Pawnee, and sweet, brave Joey, I will tear down that fence."Extra,"Okay, I'm just gonna suggest one more time that we burn it down."Extra,But whatever you guys think.Leslie Knope,Yeah.Leslie Knope,Great.April Ludgate,"Yes, hi."April Ludgate,I have a question about your inflatable saxophones.April Ludgate,Do those come in different sizes?April Ludgate,I'm gonna need about 40 dozen of those.April Ludgate,"Also, what about your neon gangster fedora hats?"April Ludgate,That was rude.Ron Swanson,"Whatever's going on here, stop it immediately."April Ludgate,I was just talking on the phone.Ron Swanson,To whom?April Ludgate,It was personal.April Ludgate,I would never make a workrelated call.April Ludgate,You know that.Leslie Knope,Lindsay!Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Leslie Knope.Leslie Knope,Hi.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hi.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Has it really been five

nice outside.Leslie Knope,Shall we speak in my courtyard?Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Yeah.Leslie Knope,"Well, thank you so much for stopping by."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I was passing through Pawnee anyway.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I do a lot of charity work here.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,There's only so much you can do.Leslie Knope,"You know, I found a picture of you from back in the day."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Oh.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Look at that.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Let me get a closer look.Leslie Knope,So let's talk about Lafayette Park.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Oh, yes."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,I'm only trying to protect our children.Leslie Knope,"Come on, Lindsay, this isn't you."Leslie Knope,"When we used to work here together, we loved the fact that parks were for everyone."Leslie Knope,That's what makes them so great.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,You know what's really great?Lindsay Carlisle Shay,A private park that's not for everyone.Leslie Knope,Wowsers.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,What do you care?Lindsay Carlisle Shay,It's just a crappy little park.Leslie Knope,"Well, someone once told me that there's no such thing as small parks, just small ideas."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Hmm.Leslie Knope,And that someone was this woman.Leslie Knope,You can take it if you want.Leslie Knope,I have many copies and the negatives.Leslie Knope,And I have a JPEG.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The fence stays up.Leslie Knope,"Lindsay, if we"Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Sweetie, and I mean this in the nicest possible way, Pawnee is and always will be a dirty, little nightmare from which you will never wake up."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,But it was good seeing you.Leslie Knope,What?Leslie Knope,I'm not asleep.Leslie Knope,I'm awake.Leslie Knope,"I'm wide awake, and I got my eyes on you."Leslie Knope,That's what I would've said if I had thought of it in the moment.Leslie Knope,What did I say instead?Ben Wyatt,Wow!Ben Wyatt,This is where they have their public forums?Leslie Knope,"Yeah, it's not that great."Tom Haverford,They had a valet.Leslie Knope,"Yes, Eagleton is nicer than Pawnee."Leslie Knope,"And, yes, because of their cupcake factory, the air always smells like vanilla."Ben Wyatt,"Oh, yeah."Ben Wyatt,Wow.Leslie Knope,But their people are not inherently better than our people.Leslie Knope,"The only thing they beat us in is life expectancy, beauty pageants, and average income."Leslie Knope,Who cares?Leslie Knope,Factoid alert.Leslie Knope,Eagleton was founded by former Pawneeans.Leslie Knope,Pawnee was established in May of 1817.Leslie Knope,"And by July, finding the smell unpleasant and the soil untenable, all the wealthy people evacuated to Eagleton."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Hello, Pawnee."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Welcome to our public forum.Tom Haverford,"Hi, I'm Thomas Montgomery Haverford."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Okay.Leslie Knope,"Well, nice outfit."Leslie Knope,"What, did you just come from the

right now.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Would you like to borrow a mirror or a selfhelp book?Leslie Knope,I would not.Leslie Knope,"I would like you to get off your high horse, Lindsay."Leslie Knope,Pun intended.Leslie Knope,"You know if I had your job, there would be no fence there."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Well, you don't have my job because you knew you couldn't handle it."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,The forum is beginning.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"We've got a little bit of Eagleton business, and then I'll introduce you."Leslie Knope,Great.Tom Haverford,Look how pretty the people are.April Ludgate,"Hey, Ron."April Ludgate,How's the street parking at your house?Ron Swanson,What?April Ludgate,"Can you handle, like, 20 cars or a doubledecker party bus?"Ron Swanson,There is no street parking at my house.April Ludgate,My house is not even on a street.April Ludgate,"Do you have space for, like, a huge circus tent?"Ann Perkins,"Hey, Ron."Ann Perkins,Have you seenAnn Perkins,What the hell?Ann Perkins,No!Ann Perkins,Oh!Ron Swanson,"Well, looks like there won't be any balloons for the birthday boy."Ann Perkins,These were for a sick child at the hospital.Ron Swanson,"My

due respect, Ms."Bertram Rolands,"Knope, can't you just clean up your side of the park, put some new equipment there?"Leslie Knope,"Well, we would love to do that, but, unfortunately, money is tight right now."Christine Porter,Hello.Christine Porter,I'm Christine Porter.Christine Porter,I want to respectfully say that I'm in favor of the fence.Christine Porter,I see it as a kind of punishment for Pawnee that might inspire your town to clean up its act.Leslie Knope,"Well, I would like to respectfully say that any child should be able to play in any park, regardless of wealth or status."Leslie Knope,"Anyway, this is Joey Plunkett."Leslie Knope,"Joey, wave to the audience."Leslie Knope,"Oh, you can't, because you broke your arm climbing that fence."Joey Plunkett,I can wave with this arm.Leslie Knope,"No, you can't."Leslie Knope,Both your arms are broken.Extra,"All due respect, I recognize that boy."Extra,He was caught selling fireworks to Eagleton kids.Leslie Knope,"Well, with more due respect, a lot of boys do that in our town."Leslie Knope,You cannot be sure that he is the one.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,This is a perfect example of how we're going to help you.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,"Here's to you, Joey, and your mother and to every Pawnee citizen who might have a bright future if they fundamentally change everything about themselves."Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Thanks to Leslie Knope.Leslie Knope,I'm not done.Lindsay Carlisle Shay,Isn't she trying her hardest?Lindsay Carlisle Shay,So cute and so good.Ron Swanson,I'm only gonna ask you this once.Ron

conversation.Ron Swanson,Just tell me what Leslie is planning.Ann Perkins,"Honestly, I don't know."Ann Perkins,I haven't heard anything.Ron Swanson,Why don't you tell me what she did for your last birthday?Ann Perkins,"Oh, well, that was intense."Ann Perkins,She totally surprised me.Ann Perkins,"She kidnapped me from work, and then she took me to that place, Seor Vega's, you know, where the mariachi band comes out."Ann Perkins,"They put a big sombrero on you, and then everybody sings ""Happy Birthday""?"Ron Swanson,Damn it.Ann Perkins,"And then we went back to my house, and she invited basically everyone I knew, and she had this great guy doing face painting, and I had my face painted like a fairy tiger."Ron Swanson,Ugh.Ann Perkins,"Also, she did it, like, a week before my birthday, which is genius, 'cause I had no idea it was coming."Ann Perkins,And then there was a bouncy castle.Ann Perkins,Did you know they made those for adults?Ron Swanson,Mmmhmm.Tom Haverford,Maybe I'll change it up this time.Tom Haverford,Can I try the andouille sausage?Leslie Knope,"Tom, let's go."Tom Haverford,What?Tom Haverford,No.Leslie Knope,"Hey, not you too."Ben Wyatt,It's gross.Ben Wyatt,I don't like it.Ben Wyatt,It's disgusting.Tom Haverford,Did you guys get your public forum gift bag?Tom Haverford,There's an iPod touch in here.Leslie Knope,"Man, she used to not be like this."Leslie Knope,Eagleton really changed her.Ben Wyatt," Yeah, what exactly happened between the two of you, anyway? "Leslie Knope,"Five years ago, Eagleton offered me that job."Tom Haverford, And you said no? Are you insane? Leslie Knope,"I talked it over with Lindsay, and we made a pact that we would stay in Pawnee together and work hard and fight to make Pawnee a better place to live."Leslie Knope," And then they offered her the job, and she took it and disappeared."Ben Wyatt, Wow.Tom Haverford, Verbena-scented soy candles! Chris Traeger,"You want me to do what, now?"Ron Swanson,"Send Leslie somewhere on an assignment, a conference or something, and make her take April and freeze their bank accounts."Chris Traeger, I don't understand.Chris Traeger, Is Leslie's work unsatisfactory?Ron Swanson,"No, it has nothing to do with her work."Ron Swanson, I don't want to get into it.Chris Traeger," Ron, look, this is me, okay?

"Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."Leslie Knope, What am I thinking? Let's just stop this.Leslie Knope, Put everything back in the truck.Leslie Knope, Let's back it up.Andy Dwyer," No, no, no, no."Andy Dwyer," Leslie, you promised we could throw garbage everywhere."Lindsay Carlisle Shay, Wow.Lindsay Carlisle Shay," I didn't expect to see the whole Parks Department here, although it is, sadly, one of the nicest spots in town."Leslie Knope," I am so sick of this, Lindsay."Tom Haverford," Wait, Leslie."Tom Haverford, I've got this.Tom Haverford," You listen to me, Lindsay Carlisle Shay."Tom Haverford," Why don't you take your fancy dog, get in your Escalade, and if you have any job openings, maybe you should let me know about 'em."Ben Wyatt," Come on, man."Tom Haverford," No! I'm sick of being treated like I'm not willing to relocate to Eagleton, because I am! So here's what you could do, lady."Tom Haverford, Take this resume and shove it into your human resources slot.Andy Dwyer," Oh, yeah!

let's both say it at the same it."Tom Haverford,Creating a spectacle.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Creating a spectacle.Tom Haverford,"No, I got it."Tom Haverford,you create pawnee's first and only highend allmedia entertainment conglomerate.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"absolutely, that's absolutely what I have to do."Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,what does it mean?Tom Haverford,"it means, audio, video, movies, 3D movies, nightclubs, iPhone apps, if its entertainment you're involved."Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Yes of course I amTom Haverford,and you call it entertainment 720.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"No, why why."Tom Haverford,You gotta stop screaming.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I will I just get excited.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Why do we call it entertainment 720?Tom Haverford,because you're willing to go around the world twice for your clients.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"That is unbelievable, but listen to me, listen to me."Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm gonna need you on my team to pull this off, all right?"Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,I can't do this without you.Tom Haverford,"I don't know man, I'd have to quit my job."Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"Okay, I'll do it without you."Leslie Knope,"I have some very important news about our favorite minihorse, Li'I Sebastian."Jerry Gergich,Yay!Jerry Gergich,Li'I Sebastian!Leslie Knope,He died last night.Tom Haverford,No.Leslie Knope,"But we can take comfort in the fact that he is in heaven now, doing the two things he loves doing the most."Leslie Knope,Eating carrots and urinating freely.Ron Swanson,"When I walked in this morning and saw the flag was at halfmast, I thought, "" All right."Ron Swanson,"""Another bureaucrat ate it."Ron Swanson,""" But then I found out it was Li'I Sebastian."Ron Swanson,Halfmast is too high.Ron Swanson,Show some damned respect.Leslie Knope,"Because of all he's done for the town, we are gonna be holding a small memorial service for him."Leslie Knope,"But for now, I think we should bow our heads in a moment of silence."Leslie Knope,"I got it, thank you."Leslie Knope,"It's times like this, when someone or some horse passes, that you really take stock of your life."Leslie Knope,You look around you and you start to realize what it is that you truly care about.Leslie Knope,"For Li'l Sebastian, I imagine it was good fresh oats, a trough of water, and a willing sexual partner."Leslie Knope,Or non-willing.Leslie Knope,"He was a horse, so I think they had to do it either way."Ben Wyatt,Hey.Ben Wyatt,"Hey Ann, how's it going."Ann Perkins,You don't have to pretend I know you're supposed to meet Leslie here.Ben Wyatt,I'm also curious about how it's going.Ann Perkins,"Leslie's busy, she's working on the Li'l Sebastian memorial service"Ann Perkins,"But you know what, she gave me this note to give to you."Ann Perkins,"And she also wanted me to kiss you deeply, which I'm gonna have to pass on."Ben Wyatt,Okay.Ann Perkins,I really like my parttime job here.Ann Perkins,"My officemate moved down the hall, so I have this whole room just for me."Ann Perkins,"And Ben and Leslie, who secretly meet here."Ann Perkins,40 times a day.Ben Wyatt,She drew a kiss monster on the noteAnn Perkins,Yeah.Ann Perkins,"Look, you guys are totally welcome to use my office."Ann Perkins,Just don't do anything on my deskBen Wyatt,"Oh, we don't, you know, we just like to work in the same place."Ben Wyatt,and then we talk and hold hands.Ann Perkins,"Yuck, that's somehow worse."Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, it sounded bad when I said it."Leslie Knope,"From now on, we stop mourning Li'l Sebastian's death and we start celebrating his life."Leslie Knope,That's what he would've wanted.Ron Swanson,"Amen, we need to send that glorious beast into the great beyond with a display that rivals the Super Bowl Halftime Show."Ron Swanson,Also the budget is 600 dollars.Leslie Knope,So maintenance is gonna set up the stage.Leslie Knope,Ron will be laying the ceremonial wreath.Jerry Gergich,"Leslie, there's a 13th century Italian poem by Dante Alighieri that would be very appropriate."Leslie Knope,"Oh, Jerry, that sounds wonderful."Leslie Knope,"Okay, Andy, I need you to write a memorial song."Leslie Knope,"Something like Candle in the Wind, but 5,000 times better."Andy Dwyer,Easy.April Ludgate,"Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer, lead singer of Mouse Rat, you should know he doesn't get out of bed for less than $1,000."Leslie Knope,"He sleeps on a futon, so"Leslie Knope,We can give him 50 bucks.April Ludgate,Sold.Leslie Knope,"Okay, here is a memo with some facts about Li'I Sebastian."Leslie Knope,I think you'll find yours particularly interesting.Ben Wyatt,It's just a list of facts.Leslie Knope,What?Jerry Gergich,"Okay, mine says, ""You have a cute butt."Leslie Knope,""" That's weird."Leslie Knope,Must be a typo.April Ludgate,"Yeah, Jerry, it's probably a typo, because it probably should've said, ""You have a cube butt."Tom Haverford,""" 'Cause your butt's shaped like a cube."Jerry Gergich,Yeah.Jerry Gergich,"The question is, why is my memo different than everyone else's?"Leslie Knope,"Cube butt, cube butt."Ben Wyatt,"Cube butt, cube butt."Tom Haverford,"Cube butt, cube butt."April Ludgate,"Cube butt, cube butt."Andy Dwyer,"Cube butt, cube butt."Dr. Harris,"Well, the good news is this is just tendonitis."Chris Traeger,How is that good news?Dr. Harris,The other option was shoulder cancer.Chris Traeger,Really?Dr. Harris,No.Dr. Harris,"Look, you exercise a lot."Dr. Harris,You're in great shape.Dr. Harris,Little things like this happen with men of your age.Chris Traeger,Men of my age?Chris Traeger,How old do you think I am?Dr. Harris,Fortytwo.Chris Traeger,"I am 44, and I plan to live to be 150."Dr. Harris,Okay.Chris Traeger,So.Chris Traeger,What's the cure?Dr. Harris,Get a time machine.Dr. Harris,Go back to being 20.Chris Traeger,Dr.Chris Traeger,"Harris, you are literally the meanest person I have ever met."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, all the permits cleared for the horse funeral."Ron Swanson,What was that tone?Ben Wyatt,What?Ben Wyatt,"Oh, nothing."Ben Wyatt,I'm very sad about this.Tom Haverford,Question!Tom Haverford,Who's a genius?Tom Haverford,"Answer, Tom Haverford."Tom Haverford,"Reason, JeanRalphio just started an exclusive, highend production company, and he's willing to put on Li'I Sebastian's memorial service pro bono, just for the pub."Tom Haverford,Pub is an abbreviation for publicity.Ron Swanson,JeanRalphio is a clown.Ron Swanson,"This is the memorial for Li'I Sebastian, not doublecoupon night at a strip club."Tom Haverford,"First off, doublecoupon night is an incredible value."Tom Haverford,"Secondly, this guy just started a business."Tom Haverford,He's my friend.Tom Haverford,It would really help him out.Tom Haverford,"Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything and make sure it goes great."Leslie Knope,"Okay, Tom, we trust you."Leslie Knope,Make us proud.Ron Swanson,Make him proud.Ben Wyatt,Why don't you just Photoshop that out?Chris Traeger,"Oh, hi, Ann Perkins."Ann Perkins,Hi.Ann Perkins,How are you?Chris Traeger,I'm dying.Ann Perkins,What?Chris Traeger,Tendonitis.Ann Perkins,Oh.Ann Perkins,"I don't know if you should lead with ""I'm dying."Chris Traeger,""" You're right, you're right."Chris Traeger,So.Chris Traeger,What's up with you?Ann Perkins,I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I Sebastian's memorial service.Chris Traeger,Li'I Sebastian died?Chris Traeger,That's terrible.Ann Perkins,"He was old, and he had a lot of ailments."Ann Perkins,Like tendonitis?Ann Perkins,I don't know.Ann Perkins,I don't have his chart in front of me.Chris Traeger,Could you get it?Ann Perkins,What?Ann Perkins,No There's no chart.Chris Traeger,"Oh, my God."Chris Traeger,Death is inescapable.Chris Traeger,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins."Leslie Knope,"Okay, so I'm meeting him in your office in a few minutes, how do I look?"Ann Perkins,What are you going for?Leslie Knope,Sophisticated with a hint of slutty.Ann Perkins,Bullseye.Ann Perkins,It's so nice to see you so happy about a guy.Leslie Knope,"Thanks, I don't know, when I look at my life right now, it feels almost perfect."Leslie Knope,"I mean we have to sleep around, but weirdly it's kind of fun that no one knows."Ann Perkins,I could see that.Leslie Knope,But enough about me.Leslie Knope,How's Ann?Ann Perkins,I'm pretty happy right now generally.Ann Perkins,Although I did see Chris today.Ann Perkins,he always just throws me off.Leslie Knope,Don't even talk about Chris.Leslie Knope,"Every time I hear his name, I think about the fact that he's gonna find out about me and Ben, and he's gonna fire both of us."Leslie Knope,And about how much he hurt you.Ann Perkins,"Yeah, there you go."Ann Perkins,Yeah.Ron Swanson,"Hello, Leslie."Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?Leslie Knope,What?Ron Swanson,How long have you been sleeping with Ben?Leslie Knope,That's disgusting and wrong.Leslie

terrible, facewise."Leslie Knope,"And how How do I know, frankly, that you're not sleeping with him?"Leslie Knope,Maybe you are.Leslie Knope,Maybe you're trying to throw me off.Leslie Knope,Hmm.Leslie Knope,Check and mate.Leslie Knope,This is an outrage!Leslie Knope,Who do I call?Ben Wyatt,"Hey, hey."Leslie Knope,"Hey, hey."Ben Wyatt,"Hey, Ron."Ben Wyatt,"Listen, you're just who I was looking for."Ben Wyatt,Are you Did you forget the Did you Can I get that thing?Ben Wyatt,"Can we just, uh Did you bring it?"Ben Wyatt,This isn't convincing.Leslie Knope,How did you find

help you with that."Ben Wyatt,it's going to be a bumpy ride to this summit meeting.Ben Wyatt,Our countries have a very special relationship.Leslie Knope,Oh no.Leslie Knope,"Okay, you've proven your point."Andy Dwyer,"In my heart, I'm sad you had to die."Andy Dwyer,"Li'l horse, spread your wings and learn to fly."April Ludgate,Horses don't fly.Andy Dwyer,That's why I'm telling them learn to fly.Andy Dwyer,"Come on, help me."Andy Dwyer,There's a lot riding on this.Andy Dwyer,This is what Li'I Sebastian's gonna listen to in horsey heaven.April Ludgate,"Okay, let me hear your favorite one so far."Andy Dwyer,You're a champion little horse And you're dead You're the champion of death You're the champion of deathApril Ludgate,"Maybe try to do one without the word ""dead"" so much."April Ludgate,"Or ""death"" or ""you're dead."Andy Dwyer,""" See?"Andy Dwyer,You're helping me already.Leslie Knope,"So the only people that know are my mom, Ann, and Ron."Leslie Knope,And they're not gonna say anything.Ben Wyatt,Right.Ben Wyatt,Just no more fooling around at work.Leslie Knope,"Okay, yeah."Leslie Knope,We can't.Ben Wyatt,"Well, I mean, you know, a situation could arise where you do something good, and I congratulate you."Ben Wyatt,"You know, kind of like this."Leslie Knope,Yes.Ben Wyatt,"Like, ""Oh, congratulations."Leslie Knope,""" That feels appropriate."Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Leslie Knope,"Yeah, I mean, I think we can get away with that as long as we don't do stuff like this."Extra,"Hey, lovebirds."Extra,What do I do with this?Leslie Knope,You can just leave it there.Extra,Okay.Leslie Knope,"So my mom, Ron, Ann, and that guy."Tom Haverford,For the memorial ribbons?Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,No doubt.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,Which

need to ask you a question, and if you're uncomfortable answering it right now, you can take some time and think about it."Chris Traeger,That would be okay.Ann Perkins,Okay?Chris Traeger,Is tendonitis symptomatic of something larger?Ann Perkins,"Really, that's that's a question you wanted to ask me?"Chris Traeger,"I'm just very worried, I'm not sure this doctor's been properly trained."Ann Perkins,"You know what, Chris, I'm sorry, I'm not your nurse, and I'm not your girlfriend."Ann Perkins,"And I thought I was twice and I was wrong, which was embarassing."Ann Perkins,I'm just not ready to be your friend.Chris Traeger,"Of course, I'm sorry."Chris Traeger,I do hope we can be friends before I die.Leslie Knope,Hey friend.Ben Wyatt,Hey.Leslie Knope,What

Saperstein,I'm the bank.Tom Haverford,You're the money.Tom Haverford,"I know, J, but it'd be a big leap."Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,And I will take that leap with you.Jean-Ralphio Saperstein,"I'm

have cried twice in my life.Ron Swanson,"Once when I was seven, and I was hit by a school bus."Ron Swanson,And then again when I heard that Li'I Sebastian had passed.Ron Swanson,"His memory will live on, as today we light a fire that will burn on for eternity."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, deep breath."Ben Wyatt,I think we got through it.Leslie Knope,Thank God.Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Leslie Knope,"Hey, Jerry,

eyebrows, I can't really tell."Leslie Knope,Ron Swanson loves his facial hair.Leslie Knope,And we burned it off.Leslie Knope,"This thing that we're doing, it's unsustainable."Ben Wyatt,"What, you

at work, we just shouldn't talk to each other at all."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard, and we could still get fired."Leslie Knope,I know.Leslie Knope,But it's worth the risk if I can be with you.Ben Wyatt,All right.Ben Wyatt,"Well, then, I'm in."Leslie Knope,What are you doing?Leslie Knope,Are you kidding me?Ben Wyatt,I'm sorry.Ben Wyatt,"No, it's force of habit."Tom

station."Leslie Knope,This gas station was owned by Mick Jagger.Ben Wyatt,Uhhuh.Leslie Knope,"I came across some financial records when I was doing some research for my book, and this gas station was owned by an M."Leslie Knope,"Jagger, which at first I thought was a woman."Leslie Knope,"Maybe Meg or something, but I think the most likely explanation is that legendary Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger owned this gas station from 1951 to 1958."Ben Wyatt,When he was 8.Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and I just knew you were a big fan of financial records, so, you're welcome."Ben Wyatt,"I know

Swanson,"Socket wrench sounds pretty good, actually."Ann Perkins,I think the danger in believing in reincarnation is that you spend so much time trying to figure out what you're going to be in the

competitive.Chris Traeger,Has there been any resistance from the community?Ben Wyatt,"No, not at all."Ben Wyatt,It's so small we don't even need to do an environmental impact report.Ben

all these classes look amazing."Andy Dwyer,I can't choose.April Ludgate,"They do this thing called a ""shopping period,"" where you can just sample as many classes as you want."Andy

Knope,What?Ben Wyatt,"Well, look, I mean, we tried hanging out together, we tried working together, and it just Bums me out."Leslie Knope,"No, no, no."Leslie Knope,We're just working out the kinks.Leslie Knope,You don't need to decrease your time with me.Leslie Knope,"In fact, you need to increase your time with me."Leslie Knope,You need to spend more time with me.Leslie Knope,That make sense?Leslie Knope,I think it does.Ben Wyatt,"No, Leslie, no, listen to me."Ben Wyatt,"After The Smallest Park wraps up, I am going to ask Chris to take over all Parks and Rec business."Ben

pistol."Tom Haverford,"Let's think bigger, people, come on."Tom Haverford,What about a top to bottom makeover for the entire department?Tom Haverford,"I'm talking new uniforms, new signage, new color scheme."Tom Haverford,"A whole, new, sexy vibe."Jerry Gergich,I don't know.Jerry Gergich,This really isn't what Chris asked us to do.Jerry Gergich,"You know, maybe we should just stick to the assignment."Tom Haverford,"Cool, Jerry."Tom Haverford,I'd take your advice if I wanted to be a deadeyed government drone with no ambition.Tom Haverford,"Yes, technically my new job is my old job, but I'm not some boring, Jerry Gergich type guy."Tom Haverford,I'm more of a Steve Harvey.Tom Haverford,"I dream big, I shake things up, and I always wear dope suits."Extra,"Okay, can anyone tell me what this is called?"Andy Dwyer,"Uh, that's a fret."Extra,Yeah.Andy Dwyer,And that little thing you got right there that's called a capo.Andy Dwyer,Changes the key.Extra,"Uh, maybe you

mean, he's not even attending the ribboncutting ceremony of a park that we made together."Ann Perkins,"I'm sorry, Leslie."Leslie Knope,I'm just freaking out.Leslie Knope,The only thing we have left is work.Leslie Knope,And now he doesn't want to work together anymore?Leslie Knope,What does that all mean?Ann Perkins,I think you know what it means.Leslie Knope,Yeah.Leslie Knope,I should just drag out that tiny park project for as long as possible so Ben and I can keep working together.Ann Perkins,That's almost exactly the opposite of what I meant.Leslie Knope,"No, what I'll do is I'll get the neighborhood all riled up, and then maybe they'll ask for an environmental impact report and then Ben and I will work together for at least another year."Ann Perkins,"Leslie, for God's sakes."Leslie Knope,"Good idea, Ann."Leslie Knope,"No, Ann, please, I beg of you."Leslie Knope,Will you just shut your beautiful pie hole?Leslie Knope,"Just sit there, let me stare at you while

endorsement of all my behaviors.Leslie Knope,"As a mature, reasonable adult, I understand that this will be the last project that Ben and I are working on together."Leslie Knope,"So please join us for the grand opening of Pawnee's Smallest Park on November 12th, 2070."Leslie Knope,"Thank you for coming to this very important and what I suspect will be lengthy, meeting."Leslie Knope,"The proposed park is very small, but we believe we need to investigate every detail."Leslie Knope,"So if anyone has any questions for me or assistant city manager Ben Wyatt, go right ahead."Extra,"Hi, I have a question about this project."Leslie Knope,"Whoa, wait."Leslie Knope,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."Leslie Knope,Where's the fire?Leslie Knope,Let's get to know each other first.Leslie Knope,Tell me about your childhood.Extra,Is there going to be basketball there?extra,Basketball courts attract undesirables to my community.Ben Wyatt,"Well, there's barely room for an actual basketball, much less a court."extra,"Because there's a definite type of person I associate with basketball, and I'd rather not have that type of person nearby."Ben Wyatt,Don't worry.Ben Wyatt,You don't need to worry.extra,"Okay, I'll just come right out and say it."extra,I'll tell you what type of person I don't like.Ben Wyatt,You don't have to do that.Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no."Ben Wyatt,I think we

excuse me."Andy Dwyer,Professor?Andy Dwyer,"Hi, there."Andy Dwyer,Andy Dwyer.Andy Dwyer,Curious.Andy Dwyer,When will you be bringing out the lasers for me to play with?Andy Dwyer,"And will we start with the small lasers, or could we go just straight to the big lasers, in terms of playing with them?"Extra,We won't be using actual lasers in this course.Extra,It's about the theory that makes them possible.Andy Dwyer,One of the most significant bummers of my lifetime.Tom Haverford,"First up, a personal favorite, the Sopranos option."Tom Haverford,"Now, I guarantee you, anyone that sees this logo is not gonna ""fugghedaboudit."""Tom Haverford,This is our current community center.Tom Haverford,Ugh.Tom Haverford,This is our new community center!Tom Haverford,"That's right, it looks like an apple store."Tom Haverford,"Today, I'm a Beverly hills plastic surgeon, and the Parks department is a wrinkly old housewife in her early 30s."Tom Haverford,I'm about to work a miracle.Leslie Knope,"Thank you, ma'am."Leslie Knope,What a story.Leslie Knope,Anyone else?Leslie Knope,"Anyone Uh, this gentleman wants to say something."Mel,"No, I don't."Leslie Knope,"Come

want to try something that I want to try.Andy Dwyer,"And I'm gonna make my choice as I always do, at random."Linda Lonegan,"As she was burned at the stake, Joan of Arc did not cower."Linda Lonegan,She did not beg for mercy.Linda Lonegan,"she said, in a strong, clear voice, ""I am not afraid."Linda Lonegan,I was born to do this.April Ludgate,""" I want to be burned at the stake."Linda Lonegan,Many societal institutions were established solely to oppress women.Linda Lonegan,"To this day, some feminists have even condemned marriage as a glorified form of slavery."Ron Swanson,Amen.April Ludgate,That class was awesome.Ron Swanson,I wholeheartedly agree.Ron Swanson,"If that woman weren't so violently opposed to marriage, I think I would propose to her."Andy

Knope,Just preparing for the grand opening of this tiny but very intrusIVE park.Extra,We were told this would have very little impact on the neighborhood.Extra,This flyer has hundreds of events.Mel,There are fireworks every night at midnight?Leslie Knope,They start at midnight.Leslie Knope,Who knows when they're gonna end?Leslie Knope,"Look, I don't even know the impact of this park, because the city skipped an environmental impact report."Leslie Knope,So we don't know about traffic problems or sound or lights or crime.Leslie Knope,"I mean, it's all a mystery."Extra,Don't you work for the government?Leslie Knope,"I do, Joe."Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's how I know just how high this conspiracy goes."Leslie Knope,What can we do about it?Leslie Knope,I'm glad you

going, Joe?"Extra,Bathroom break.Leslie Knope,"No, get back over there."Leslie Knope,I'll find you a bottle or something.Chris Traeger,Where did all these people come from?Chris Traeger,And why did they turn so quickly on this project?Leslie Knope,"Well, you know how it goes."Leslie Knope,It only takes one nut job to get people riled up.Leslie Knope,"I hate to say this, but I think we're gonna have to do that environmental impact report."Leslie Knope,They are explicitly demanding it.Ben Wyatt,"Hey, everybody, listen up."Ben Wyatt,"Uh, in response to your complaints, we are cancelling all of these disruptive events."Ben Wyatt,"This park is just gonna be a quiet patch of grass, harming nobody."Ben Wyatt,Everybody cool?Ben Wyatt,Great.Chris Traeger,Dream team.Ben Wyatt,"Actually, Chris, I know you think that we're a dream team"Chris Traeger,Dream team!Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Ben Wyatt,But we're not.Ben Wyatt,"You see, Leslie here is a team of one."Ben Wyatt,"And that might be a very good team, but she kind of steamrolls the rest of her team, me, to do whatever she wants."Ben Wyatt,"Regardless of how the rest of her team, me, feels."Ben Wyatt,So I don't think we should work together anymore.Chris Traeger,Wow.Chris Traeger,That was very hard to hear.Chris Traeger,So many negative words.Chris Traeger,I just need to process this.Chris Traeger,"Okay, the dream team is dead."Chris Traeger,But you guys had a great run.Ben Wyatt,"Oh, and the park is open."Ben Wyatt,Yay!Chris Traeger,Good job with that.Andy Dwyer,"Hello ma'am, who

Ludgate,I'll just have them pay for yours too.Andy Dwyer,"Oh, God, no!"Andy Dwyer,That's embarrassing.Andy Dwyer,I know.Andy Dwyer,I'm gonna beg for money in the street like a drug addict.April Ludgate,No.Andy Dwyer,Yeah.Leslie Knope,Oh my God.Leslie Knope,Everything in my life is going wrong right now.Leslie Knope,Whose fault is this?Leslie Knope,I demand to know.Ann Perkins,Actually

Knope,"I know, Ann, you keep starting all these sentences and not finishing"Ann Perkins, You're a steamroller!Ann Perkins,"You are a massive, enormous, runaway steamroller with no brakes and a cement brick on the gas pedal."Ann Perkins,You made me watch all eight Harry Potter movies.Ann Perkins,I don't even like Harry Potter.Leslie Knope,That's insane.Leslie Knope,You love Harry Potter.Leslie Knope,You've seen all eight movies!Ann Perkins,"When we go out to a bar, you order my drinks for me."Leslie Knope,"Because you order white wine, and it gives you a headache."Ann Perkins,"Well, it's my headache!"Ann Perkins,"Leslie, you do what you want, you ignore what other people want, and you hear only what you want to hear."Leslie Knope,Okay.Leslie Knope,I know.Leslie Knope,I know I do this.Leslie Knope,I'm the worst.Ann Perkins,"No, you're very passionate."Ann Perkins,You just push too hard sometimes.Leslie Knope,"Well, you should call me a bulldozer rather than a steamroller."Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.Ann Perkins,It's gonna be okay.Leslie Knope,Is it?Leslie Knope,"Honestly, is it?"Leslie Knope,"I mean, I guess I just need to leave Ben alone."Leslie Knope,That's what he says he wants.Leslie Knope,Okay.Leslie Knope,"Well, this steamroller is hanging up her The rolly thing on the front of the machine."Leslie Knope,What do you what do you call that?Ann Perkins,The roller?Leslie Knope,Probably.Leslie Knope,Okay.Jerry Gergich,"Got you a little pickmeup, Tommy."Jerry Gergich,A tripledecker ham and cheese from the cafeteria.Jerry Gergich,Always makes me feel better.Tom Haverford,Two pathetic guys eating pathetic sandwiches.Tom Haverford,Sounds terrific.Tom Haverford,I guess I'm Jerry now.Tom Haverford,"After work, I'll just go home, straight to my boring house, kiss my wife, and have a homecooked meal with my three beautiful daughters."Tom Haverford,What a miserable life.Jerry Gergich,"I have been here, well, 30 some years, and the best way to cope with this job is to do everything the exact same way every day."Jerry Gergich,"Heck, I still use my original I.D."Jerry Gergich,Card from my first day on the

never be a hoarder or a miser about it.Ann Perkins,Hey.Ben Wyatt,"Okay, is this health department business or Leslie business?"Ann Perkins,You need to go talk to her.Ben Wyatt,Why?Ben Wyatt,So she can force me to spend time with her again?Ben Wyatt,No.Ben Wyatt,No way.Ben Wyatt,I'm done talking.Ann Perkins,"Listen, I know she can be strong willed and difficult, okay?"Ann Perkins,She once made me eat an entire cheesecake at a potluck so she didn't look bad.Ann Perkins,But I really think she's ready to listen.Ben Wyatt,You ate an entire cheesecake?Ben Wyatt,Why didn't you just throw it away?Ann Perkins,"Because with everything she's done for me, I would eat ten cheesecakes for her."Ann Perkins,"Also, P.S."Ann Perkins,"it was delicious and amazing, like everything she does."Ann Perkins,Will you please just talk to her?Ann Perkins,For my sake?Ann Perkins,"I don't have unlimited texting, and when she can't talk to you, she texts me."Tom Haverford," So we take the

Wyatt, I appreciate that.Leslie Knope," If you don't want to have any more contact with me, I finally understand."Ben Wyatt, I I don't want that.Ben Wyatt, Really.Ben Wyatt, But I just think it's

you like to make a statement at this time?Leslie Knope,Yes.Leslie Knope,"I freely admit to the relationship, and I will not be fighting the charges that we violated Chris' rule."Leslie Knope,But we

adorable nicknames and amazing back rubs.Leslie Knope,"Oh, you mean professionally."Leslie Knope,No.Chris Traeger,"And did you break any local, state, or federal law in an effort to cover up your

Traeger,It is an important rule that exists in every government.Chris Traeger,"Romantic relationships between superiors and their employees lead to fraud, corruption, and misuse of public funds."Leslie Knope,And you think I'm guilty of that?Chris Traeger,I think that you began your relationship with Ben Wyatt earlier than you're saying.Chris Traeger,"I believe that you certainly received special treatment, and I think that you may even be guilty of bribery."Leslie Knope,None of those things are true.Leslie Knope,"And I will prove it, Mr. Traeger."Extra,"Okay, ten minute

will accept a slap on the wrist."Leslie Knope,But when you sit back and let your reputation be destroyed.Leslie Knope,You go down in history as a frozen whore.Leslie Knope,I'm fighting.Ann Perkins,"Hey, grab my computer."Ann Perkins,I'm all set.Leslie Knope,Great.Leslie Knope,You're up next.Leslie Knope,How is Ben?Leslie Knope,Is he sad?Leslie Knope,"You need to cheer him up, Ann."Ann Perkins,Ben is fine.Ann Perkins,He says he's sorry he's not in here.Ann Perkins,He said to look at the monster.Ann Perkins,I'm hoping you know what that means.Ron Swanson,There's a rumor going around that Chris has a killer witness.Leslie Knope,How?Leslie Knope,Why?Leslie Knope,That makes no sense.Leslie Knope,"There's no killer witness, because we didn't do anything wrong unless someone's planning to lie or slander us."Leslie Knope,"Okay, just to be safe, find out who it is and silence him."Ron Swanson,With pleasure.Leslie Knope,Wait.Leslie Knope,Let me make it clear.Leslie Knope,Don't silence him.Leslie Knope,Just make sure he can't talk.Extra,"Okay, we're back."Extra,"Clear this chamber, please."Leslie Knope,"Ms. Perkins, Chris Traeger has questioned

that that is a yes."Chris Traeger,How long were you two lovers?Tom Haverford,Excuse me?Leslie Knope,"Oh, God."Chris Traeger,"Last march, I witnessed Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford engaged in a passionate yet tender kiss."Chris Traeger,It seems that Ms.Chris Traeger,Knope has a pattern of becoming involved with her coworkers.Leslie Knope,"Tom, will you please tell the committee why we were kissing?"Tom Haverford,An online dating site randomly paired us up.Tom Haverford,"So, as a joke, I thought it would be funny to pretend you and I were dating."Tom Haverford,And then you kissed me as a joke To shut me up.Leslie Knope,But we never had any other romantic contact after that.Tom Haverford,"No, that would be like dating my older sister's elderly aunt."Leslie Knope,"No, it wouldn't."Leslie Knope,"Well, we've been at it for hours."Leslie Knope,And I did have some problem with my character witnesses.April Ludgate,I don't know why Leslie Knope's on trial.April

laptop?Andy Dwyer,Objection.Leslie Knope,"But other than that, I think I'm winning."Leslie Knope,I've refuted every one of Chris' claims so far.Chris Traeger,I have here a receipt from Pawnee Supersuites Motel.Chris Traeger,Leslie Knope submitted that receipt for reimbursement.Chris Traeger,Taxpayers' money is not meant to be spent on a romantic getaway.Leslie Knope,"Donna, will you please describe what we were wearing the evening you saw us?"Donna Meagle,"Um, khakis and buttondown shirts your basic white people clothes."Leslie Knope,"And when you walked into the room, what did it look like?"Leslie Knope,Did it look like anything romantic had happened?Donna Meagle,"Oh, hell, no."Donna Meagle,"I have ruined my share of hotel rooms, and trust me, nothing sexual happened in that room."Donna Meagle,It kind of looked like an office.Leslie Knope,Maybe because it was an office.Leslie Knope,"City Hall was being fumigated, and we need to pull an allnighter."Leslie Knope,The only thing that was ravaged were these federal grant proposals that Donna had dropped off earlier.Leslie Knope,"I've seen over 200 episodes of Law & Order, and it's paying off bigtime."Leslie Knope,"And by the way, we got the gramps grants."Leslie Knope,God!Leslie Knope,Oh.Leslie Knope,It was gonna be such an awesome moment.Leslie Knope,"So, Ethel, you've been to a

candy should I choose?"""Tom Haverford,"Obviously chocolate, 'cause I'm sweet, smooth, and the ladies love me."Tom Haverford,"Now the question still remained, ""what kind of chocolate am I?"Tom Haverford,""" Do I have a little gooey, caramel center?"Tom Haverford,Am I filled with little rice krispies?Tom Haverford,Maybe I'm white chocolate and I'm bucking all the stereotypes.Ann Perkins,"Oh, just put your damn candy out."Tom Haverford,"Ultimately, I decided to go with a little gourmet fudge."Tom Haverford,"I didn't have time to make it into anything, and please don't eat it 'cause it cost $55 an ounce."Donna Meagle,So I made my desk out of silver m&ms.Donna Meagle,"But they do not make silver m&ms, so I spraypainted them."Ann Perkins,"Okay, those are poisonous, so no

Dwyer,Three!Andy Dwyer,That's what makes him the best.Andy Dwyer,He can do more with three legs than most dogs can do with four.April Ludgate,Except for digging.April Ludgate,He's really bad at digging.Andy Dwyer,And you remember what you said about making decisions in the house?Andy Dwyer,You want to be involved.Andy Dwyer,"We get that, so You just say the word, and Champion goes back to the pound, where he can be put down and killed forever."Ben Wyatt,I'm not gonna send a three legged dog to his death.Andy Dwyer,Yes!Ben Wyatt,But I'm not gonna take care of him for you.April Ludgate,"Well, it would be nice if you helped a little."April Ludgate,"Because, unlike you, Andy and I have jobs."Ben Wyatt,"Cruel, but fair."Ann Perkins,So Leslie and I have come up with the theme for the campaign relaunch rally.Leslie Knope,"""The Comeback Kid."""Ann Perkins,Everyone loves a good comeback story.Ann Perkins,Rocky.Leslie Knope,"Robert Downey, Jr."Andy Dwyer,"Terminator said, ""I'll be back,"" and he was."Tom Haverford,Also making a comeback the casual Hawaiian shirt.Jerry Gergich,"Well, well, well, look, who's ahead of the curve."Tom Haverford,I was joking.Tom Haverford,You should soak that in bleach and burn it.Ann Perkins,"Okay, so, the rally's going to be held tomorrow at the Pawnee Sports Building."Ann Perkins,"April, you finalized a rental, right?"April Ludgate,"Shut up, Ann."April Ludgate,I told you never to talk to me.April Ludgate,That was Champion.April Ludgate,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry."April Ludgate,Bad dog!April Ludgate,"Yes, everything's fine with the rental."Leslie Knope,"Ron, you're constructing the stage?"Ron Swanson,"Yes, ma'am."Ron Swanson,Leslie wanted to hire a contractor to build a stage.Ron Swanson,"I don't want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief."Ben Wyatt,"Seal the edges by crimping the fork aw, crap."Chris Traeger,BenBen Wyatt,"What's up, Chris?"Ben Wyatt,"Come on in, man."Chris Traeger,I already did.Chris Traeger,"So, uh, how you been?"Chris Traeger,How are you doing?Chris Traeger,How are you?Ben Wyatt,"Great, actually."Ben Wyatt,"I'm just learning how to make a ""calizoinza."""Ben Wyatt,"Or, as you Americans like to say, calzones."Ben Wyatt,Do you want one?Chris Traeger,"No, I find calzone fatty, and unnecessary."Chris Traeger,"So, you've hit a bit of a rough patch, and I care about you, so I just want to make sure you're doing okay."Ben Wyatt,"Chris, honestly, I'm great."Ben Wyatt,I'm just exploring whatever fun activity pops into my brain.Ben Wyatt,"Like, check this out."Ben Wyatt,I'm teaching myself how to do Claymation videos.Ben Wyatt,Isn't this just so cool?Chris Traeger,It is so cool!Chris Traeger,"Ben is massively depressed, and he needs my help."Leslie Knope,You look like a real campaign manager.Ann Perkins,"Oh, thanks, that's because I googled ""campaign manager"" and noticed that they wear a lot of dark colors."Leslie Knope,"See, there's more things to look at on the Internet  besides naked guys, Ann."Ann Perkins,What?Leslie Knope,"I need a team update, campaign manager."Ann Perkins,Okay.Ann Perkins,Pistol Pete Disellio will be here in five minutes.Leslie Knope,I still can't believe that you got him.Leslie Knope,Ann got local hero Pistol Pete Disellio to endorse me at the rally.Leslie Knope,"In 1992, Pistol Pete's last second dunk against Eagleton High clinched a comeback victory for the Pawnee Central drunken savages."Leslie Knope,Team mascot later changed.Tom Haverford,"Akash, buddy, of course I came to you first."Tom Haverford,You're the best carpet man in Pawnee.Tom Haverford,But here's my question Do your carpets match your drapes?Tom Haverford,How do you make any event classy on a budget?Tom Haverford,Red carpet.Tom Haverford,My entire apartment is red carpet.Tom Haverford,"On top of that, leading into my bedroom, a second red carpet."Tom Haverford,"Oh, what's this in my shoe?"Tom Haverford,Red carpet insole.Tom Haverford,"Everywhere I go, I'm walking on red carpet."Tom Haverford,Is there even enough room for everyone?April Ludgate,"Here, sit on my lap."Tom Haverford,"No, that's humiliating."Tom Haverford,Can't I at least sit on Andy's lap?Andy Dwyer,"No, that's Champion's spot."Andy Dwyer,He called it.Ron Swanson,"Tom, we're already late."Ron Swanson,"Now, be a man, and sit on that girl's lap."Tom Haverford,"Yes, sir."Pete Disellio,"Hi, Pete Disellio."Leslie Knope,"We can call you Pistol, right?"Pete Disellio,I prefer Pete.Leslie Knope,Oh.Leslie Knope,"Okay, got it."Leslie Knope,I'm Leslie Knope.Leslie Knope,We overlapped a year at Pawnee Central.Leslie Knope,You probably remember my voice from the morning announcements.Leslie Knope,"This is my campaign manager, Ann Perkins."Ann Perkins,"Hi, nice to meet you."Ann Perkins,Come on in.Pete Disellio,"Oh, thanks."Pete Disellio,I'm excited to be here.Leslie Knope,Ah!Leslie Knope,We're excited to have you.Leslie Knope,Ann is killing it.Leslie Knope,My campaign team is unstoppable.Leslie Knope,This rally is going to be awesome.Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, I'm feeling it!"Leslie Knope,I'm gonna break dance!Ann Perkins,Leslie?Leslie Knope,Coming!Leslie Knope,Thank God.Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Champion is a way better kisser than you are, babe."April Ludgate,Nuhuh!Andy Dwyer,"Yes, he is."Andy Dwyer,He's even a better kisser than me.Andy Dwyer,"Here, try some."Tom Haverford,"Okay, stop it."Tom Haverford,He's drooling on me!Andy Dwyer,Oh!Ron Swanson,This is unsafe.Andy Dwyer,Ha ha!Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we should do it for the kids."Andy Dwyer,"Kids love it, Ron."Andy Dwyer,Just for the kids.Andy Dwyer,"Hi, kids!"Andy Dwyer,Hey!Andy Dwyer,"Oh, look."Andy Dwyer,The police even love it.Andy Dwyer,They're sirening back to us.Andy Dwyer,"That's awesome, I was going to tell them that we Heard ya, bud!"Leslie Knope,"And then, you come out, and you dunk the ball, and you say, ""Voting for Leslie Knope is a slam dunk!"""Leslie Knope,"You can still dunk, right?"Pete Disellio,"Oh, I can, but I won't."Leslie Knope,Sorry?Pete Disellio,"Look, everywhere I go, everybody wants me to talk about that dunk, and that game."Pete Disellio,It feels like I'm living in the past.Leslie Knope,But the past is great.Leslie Knope,"The jitterbug, stagecoaches, Herman Munster."Pete Disellio,"Look, Leslie, I read up on you."Pete Disellio,"You've done great stuff for our parks system and I will happily endorse you As Peter Disellio, regional distributor for Derwin ham loafs, but if this is about who I was, or what I did when I was 17, I'm out of here."Leslie Knope,Let's not talk about dunking anymore.Leslie Knope,Let's talk about what you want to do.Pete Disellio,Okay.Leslie Knope,I think you want to dunk.Pete Disellio,I'm not going to dunk the ball.Ann Perkins,What about a layup?Ron Swanson,"Officer, I've been operating heavy machinery since I was eight years old."Ron Swanson,"Now, I respect you and your service to this town and your country, but what laws are we breaking exactly?"Police Officer,"Well, you got four people in the front seat, nobody's wearing a seat belt, you were speeding and blasting your horn through the hospital zone, the rear of the vehicle's open, debris has been falling out, and you don't have a commercial license to drive a truck."Ron Swanson,Okay.Ron Swanson,"Well, we have a philosophical difference on what constitutes a law."Police Officer,"I need to see your hands and could you step out of the vehicle, please?"April Ludgate,Hi.April Ludgate,I just wanted you to know we're about to be arrested.Ann Perkins,"Oh my God, April, that's horrible."Ann Perkins,Where are you?Ann Perkins,"""My mother's butt,"" really?"Ann Perkins,That's really helpful.Leslie Knope,Let me talk to her.Leslie Knope,"April, this is city council candidate Leslie Knope."Leslie Knope,Do not make any trouble.Leslie Knope,Sit tight.Leslie Knope,I'm on my way.Ann Perkins,Whoa.Ann Perkins,You just hung up on her?Leslie Knope,She'd already hung up on me.Leslie Knope,"Okay, I'm going to go down there and get them out, because men in uniform love me."Leslie Knope,You have to get Pistol Pete to make that shot.Ann Perkins,"Okay, but if I don't, it's no big deal, right?"Ann Perkins,You'll just make your speech?Leslie Knope,He's our surprise headliner.Leslie Knope,The whole town loves him.Leslie Knope,I'm polling at 1%.Leslie Knope,"He must dunk, Ann."Leslie Knope,Do whatever it takes.Leslie Knope,"You know, anything short of sexual favors."Ann Perkins,What?Leslie Knope,"I do not I repeat, I do not want you to tempt him with sexual favors."Ann Perkins,I wasn't going to.Leslie Knope,"Good, I wouldn't either."Leslie Knope,That's where I draw the line.Leslie Knope,"Although, I am a little offended that you wouldn't do that for me."Ann Perkins,Go.Leslie Knope,Right.Chris Traeger,"So, Ben"Chris Traeger,Why Calzone?Ben Wyatt,"Glad you asked, Chris."Ben Wyatt,"You know, there's fast food hamburgers."Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Mexican.Ben Wyatt,There's fast food Chinese.Ben Wyatt,Blah blah blah.Ben Wyatt,Have you ever wondered why there isn't a fast food option for Italian food?Chris Traeger,What about pizza?Ben Wyatt,Pizza?Ben Wyatt,Never heard of it.Ben Wyatt,"That's what people will be saying in 20 years, because pizza is old news, Chris."Ben Wyatt,Pizza is your grandfather's calzone.Chris Traeger,Never thought of it that way.Ben Wyatt,"What I'm talking about is a portable, delicious meal, that is it's own container."Ben Wyatt,It's a whole new spin on Italian fast casual dining.Chris Traeger,Amazing.Ben Wyatt,And you of all people will like this.Ben Wyatt,I'm gonna use low fat ingredients.Chris Traeger,Gamechanger.Ben Wyatt,"And I will call my new Italian fast casual eatery ""The Lowcal Calzone Zone."""Chris Traeger,That idea is literally the greatest idea I've ever heard in my life.Chris Traeger,That idea is terrible.Leslie Knope,"Glen, you're killing me."Police Officer,"They broke about 50 laws, Knope."Police Officer,"And that girl, she tried to get that gimp dog to bite me."Leslie Knope,"Look, I could sit here and fill out all the paperwork, but you and I both know that you'd rather go home to Debra, have a nice homecooked meal, and do what comes naturally."Police Officer,That's not appropriate.Leslie Knope,You know that I'm gonna pay all the fines.Leslie Knope,"I'm in the middle of a campaign rally, and this is my team."Leslie Knope,"I need them, please."Police Officer,Fine.Police Officer,"But unless one of you has a commercial license, you can't take that truck."Ann Perkins,It would just mean so much to us.Ann Perkins,"I mean, you're a living legend."Ann Perkins,They still air that game every Friday night on cable access.Pete Disellio,"Yeah, well, being a living legend is sort of a doubleedged sword."Pete Disellio,"Everybody in this town still calls me ""Pistol."""Ann Perkins,"Tell me more about that, Peter."Pete Disellio,"I mean, yes, that dunk, it made me famous, but sometimes Sometimes life dunks you."Chris Traeger,"Hey, man, you want to go for a jog?"Chris Traeger,"Just, sort of, kick out the cobwebs, get some endorphins going?"Ben Wyatt,"Oh, no, thanks, Chris."Ben Wyatt,Kind of tearing this Claymation video a new one right now.Chris Traeger,"You know, Ben, I really think you need to take a step back here."Chris Traeger,I think getting some perspective would be good.Ben Wyatt,What are you talking about?Chris Traeger,I've known you a long time.Chris Traeger,"And, right now, you need help."Ben Wyatt,With my Claymaish?Chris Traeger,With your life.Chris Traeger,"You are wildly, insanely depressed."Ben Wyatt,Depressed?Ben Wyatt,I'm the furthest thing from depressed.Ben Wyatt,"I mean, look at what I've accomplished."Ben Wyatt,Do you see him?Ben Wyatt,Do you think a depressed person could make this?Ben Wyatt,No.Ron Swanson,That's all we can fit in here.Leslie Knope,No problem.Leslie Knope,This is going to be fine.Leslie Knope,"We're all going to be fine, because the team is still together, and there's nothing the team can't do."April Ludgate,"Wait, I think Champion has to go to the bathroom."Andy Dwyer,Oh!Andy Dwyer,He shall do it in the car!Leslie Knope,"Answer your phone, Ann."Pete Disellio,That's what life is like in a strict Roman Catholic household.Pete Disellio,"Of course, my father, he was more stick than carrot when it came to matters of discipline."Chris Traeger,"I'm sorry, but the Ben Wyatt that I know, I just don't think he'd be happy sitting here faffing around."Ben Wyatt,I'm not faffing around.Ben Wyatt,I've sunk myself into my hobbies.Ben Wyatt,"Here, I'll show you my Claymation project, okay?"Ben Wyatt,"Now, I've been working pretty hard on this, and I think it's really good."Ben Wyatt,"So just hang on to your hat, okay?"Ben Wyatt,Here it goes.Chris Traeger,"Oh, how great."Chris Traeger,Did you pause it?Ben Wyatt,"No, I hang on."Ben Wyatt,"Oh, my God."Ben Wyatt,That's the whole thing.Ben Wyatt,That's three weeks of work.Chris Traeger,You're gonna be okay.Ben Wyatt,"No, no, no, no, I'm not."Ben Wyatt,"You see, in my head, I thought that was really, really cool."Ben Wyatt,"I emailed Leslie two days ago and I compared it to Avatar, Chris, and how can it not be longer?"Chris Traeger,"Okay, look, what you're feeling, right now is regret and shame."Chris Traeger,But we are going to get through this.Leslie Knope,"Okay, no word from Ann."Leslie Knope,"April, I need a status report."Leslie Knope,How's it looking out there?April Ludgate,"Perfect, but just one thing."April Ludgate,It's not a basketball court any more.April Ludgate,It's an ice skating rink.Leslie Knope,"Wait, what?"Leslie Knope,Why?Leslie Knope,What happened?April Ludgate,The stupid guy I called to book this place didn't tell me they took off the basketball floor for a hockey game.April Ludgate,"Or maybe he did tell me, but he was so stupid and boring that I wasn't listening, and either way, it was his fault, because he was stupid and I hated him."Leslie Knope,"Ron, how's the stage coming?"Ron Swanson,"Well, since we had to jettison the bulk of the wood, this is the biggest I could make it."Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."Leslie Knope,"Good lord, what happened to the rest of my face?"Andy Dwyer,"We had to ""Jetsons"" most of the poster too, but I kind of like it, 'cause windows are the eyes to the house."Tom Haverford,Wow.Ann Perkins,"Okay, I got Pistol Pete."Leslie Knope,"Good, where is he?"Ann Perkins,"Right now, he's curled up in the back seat of my car, talking about his father, who is a piece of work."Ann Perkins,"I actually think he did the best he could for a single father, but I may be too close to the situation."Ann Perkins,"Anyway, the important news is that he's here."Leslie Knope,Good.Leslie Knope,Is he going to dunk for me?Ann Perkins,"I'm not sure, I couldn't hear through all the crying."Leslie Knope,He's crying?Ann Perkins,"No, I was crying."Ann Perkins,"It's been a stressful day, and he's had a really rough life."Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God."Leslie Knope,"We should cancel it, right?"Leslie Knope,Maybe we should cancel it?Leslie Knope,Yeah.Leslie Knope,Jerry You were in charge of getting a crowd.Leslie Knope,"Please tell me that you pulled a Jerry, and no one's here."Jerry Gergich,"Okay, well, first of all, I don't like it when you guys use that term."Jerry Gergich," But for the record, I came through."Jerry Gergich, There are almost a hundred people out there! Leslie Knope,"Oh, damn it, Jerry, you just had to do your job, didn't you?"April Ludgate,"Yeah, can't you do anything wrong, Jerry?"Leslie Knope,"I've been looking at our utter and complete lack of experience as a positive thing, but I'm starting to think it actually might be a problem."Leslie Knope," Okay, guys, everybody listen up."Leslie Knope, I just wanted to say thank you.Leslie Knope," You've all volunteered your time and, no matter what, I am eternally grateful for it."Leslie Knope," Now, I'm going to go out there, and I'm going to announce the relaunch, and I'm going to muddle through this thing as best I can."Leslie Knope," You should all leave, and when this thing is over, I'll meet you at the nearest bar."Tom Haverford, That would be Hurley's.Andy Dwyer,"Oh, it's karaoke tonight! "April Ludgate,Yes!Ann Perkins,"No, no, no, guys."Ann Perkins, No.Ann Perkins," We're not leaving, okay? We're the reason Leslie's in this mess."Ann Perkins, It's our mess.Ann Perkins, We're going to stay here and we're going to go out there as a team.Tom Haverford," Or, we go as a team to Hurley's."Ron Swanson," No, Ann's right."Ron Swanson, We're a team.Ron Swanson, We're all going out together.Leslie Knope, Let's give this crowd a show.Ron Swanson," Go, team! "Leslie Knope, Tom?Tom Haverford,Couldn't afford enough premium carpet to get us to the stage.Tom Haverford," I mean, it was a short walk, but it was pretty luxurious, right?"Leslie Knope,Okay.Leslie Knope, Everybody smile and wave.Music,  Get up and make it happen   get on your feet April Ludgate,"Stop leaning on my arm, Andy."Ron Swanson, I'm holding the dog.Ron Swanson, He is peeing.Ron Swanson, He is now peeing.Ron Swanson, I am putting him down.April Ludgate," No, Ron, he only has three legs!"Ann Perkins,Get off me!Tom Haverford,"No, I'm scared!"Music, Get up and make it happen Leslie Knope,Ron? Ron? There's no stairs.Leslie Knope, How do I get onto the stage? Okay.Leslie Knope, Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!  Mm-mm.Chris Traeger, Here you go.Chris Traeger," Drink up, because it has every herb in my herb belt."Ben Wyatt, Oh.Ben Wyatt, Tastes like a belt.Chris Traeger," I know, isn't it awful? But it works wonderfully."Chris Traeger," So, tell me."Chris Traeger, Do you admit that you're depressed? Ben Wyatt,How did you know? I didn't even know.Chris Traeger," The Letters to Cleo t-shirt, the unshaven face, the Doc Martins, and your hair does not have that normal, uptight, rigid, inflexible Ben Wyatt sense of fun."Chris Traeger, You can't hide these things from friends.Ben Wyatt, I think I'm feeling better.Chris Traeger," Herbal smoothie, you have done it again."Leslie Knope," As a loyal pawneean, I've always been proud of this town, and, I, oh, um, sorry."Leslie Knope, My cards got out of order here when they fell.Leslie Knope," Together, we can defeat obese children."Leslie Knope," I'm sure that was something positive, originally."Leslie Knope," I'm sorry, okay, this is just a disaster, isn't it? This is the worst political event ever in history."Leslie Knope," Well, um, I can assure you people in the bleachers that, if you follow my campaign, it will be interesting."Pete Disellio," It sure will be! Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Pistol Pete, and around here, I'm a Pawnee legend! I just wanted to say that I fully endorse Leslie Knope."Pete Disellio," She's got a great team behind her, and a vote for her is a slam dunk."Leslie Knope," Thanks, Pistol Pete!"Leslie Knope,"Wow, we're so happy to have you."Leslie Knope," Oh, hey."Leslie Knope, There he goes.Leslie Knope," Come on, Pete! Oh!"Ann Perkins,"Okay, stay still."Ann Perkins, Stay down.Leslie Knope," Pistol Pete, everybody."Leslie Knope, Still got it.Leslie Knope,Hey.Ben Wyatt,"Hey, how was the rally?"Andy Dwyer,"Oh, we nailed it!"Leslie Knope,"No, we didn't."Leslie Knope," Ben, my campaign manager and I have made a decision."Ann Perkins," We've decided to fire the campaign manager, me."Leslie Knope,And hire you.Ben Wyatt,But we've talked about this.Leslie Knope, I don't care if you're poison to my campaign.Leslie Knope, This team has a lot of heart and zero know-how.Leslie Knope, You're the only one that can save us.Leslie Knope, Please be my campaign manager.Chris Traeger," You know, Leslie, Ben's really been going through something, and he's on a journey, so I don't think he's gonna be"Ben Wyatt,I'll do it.Ben Wyatt, I'm in.Ben Wyatt, I've done enough exploring.Ben Wyatt, I'm good.Chris Traeger,"Okay, great."Leslie Knope,"Ann, you're fired."Ann Perkins," Oh, thank God."April Ludgate," No, don't make out."April Ludgate, It's making Champion sad.Ann Perkins, Surprise!

to explain himself, and Ann lied to me about this date."Leslie Knope,"I mean, so many injustices."April Ludgate,"Ann would never do anything to piss you off, Leslie."April Ludgate,"You guys are

just have a romantic dinner"Ben Wyatt,"No, we have to go catch them in the act."Ben Wyatt,Right now.Leslie Knope,Really?Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Ben Wyatt, Screw romantic dinners.Ben Wyatt, Let's go rub

really good."Andy Dwyer,"I was gonna give it to Champion, but it just it looked so yummy."Andy Dwyer,"The point is, I'm a terrible dog owner."Andy Dwyer,"And I think, if we find Champion, you should keep him."Chris Traeger,"Andy, if it wasn't for you and April, Champion would still be back at the pound."Chris Traeger,You gave him a home.Chris Traeger,That's amazing.Chris Traeger,And he's your dog.Chris Traeger,"If you just call out his name, he will come to you."Andy Dwyer,"What no, he won't 'cause I've been trying it, and it didn't work."Chris Traeger,I think he likes your

                ",Season: 4 Episode: 17Extra,"This is ""The Final Word with Perd."""Extra,"With your host, Perderick L."Extra,Hapley.Perd Hapley,Issue number one is the first issue we're going to talk about.Perd Hapley,Is Bobby Newport's campaign for city council in trouble?Perd Hapley,"When I say your names, I want you to respond."Perd Hapley,Dylan.Extra,"Well, Newport's poll numbers have been plummeting."Extra,"They just fired his campaign manager, and where's Bobby?"Extra,He's on vacation in Spain.Extra,"He's not on vacation, he's in hiding."Extra,"Every time the guy speaks, he puts his foot in his mouth."Perd Hapley,That's a hilarious image.Perd Hapley,A foot in a mouth.Extra,It's a common expression.Perd Hapley,Okay.Perd Hapley,"According to the newest polls, Leslie knope is now in second place."Perd Hapley,She's just 15 points back.Jerry Gergich,"Whoa, yeah!"Perd Hapley,How did she close the gap?Extra,"You have to give a lot of credit to her campaign manager, Ben Wyatt."Leslie Knope,"So apparently, Newport just fired his campaign manager because Ben was kicking his ass."Leslie Knope,Ben is the best campaign manager anyone could ever have.Leslie Knope,Every move he's made has worked.Leslie Knope,"He's like a brilliant, sexy, little hummingbird."Ben Wyatt,What did you just say?Leslie Knope,Nothing.Leslie Knope,Keep up the good work.Leslie Knope,You're doing great.Ben Wyatt,"Senior citizens are basically the only people who vote in local elections, so if you want to win, you gotta get the gray vote."Leslie Knope,"And to get the gray vote, you need to get the endorsement of Ned Jones."Leslie Knope,He's the president of Pawnee Seniors United.Leslie Knope,He's like The Godfather but old.Ben Wyatt,He's like The Grandfather.Ben Wyatt,The Grand Godfather.Leslie Knope,"The ""grond"" father, he's like It doesn't matter."Leslie Knope,"He's important, and he's old."Leslie Knope,"Mr. Jones, such a pleasure to meet you."Leslie Knope,Please don't get up.Ned Jones,Don't worry.Ned Jones,I can't.Leslie Knope,Oh.Ned Jones,Just joking.Ned Jones,I can get up.Ned Jones,But it's difficult.Ned Jones,"But I can do it, but it is hard."Ned Jones,"Look, I don't have a lot of time."Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."Ben Wyatt,I'm so sorry.Ben Wyatt,Is it cancer?Ned Jones,"No, I don't have a lot of time before my swim aerobics."Ben Wyatt,Oh.Ned Jones,Why are you better for seniors than Bobby Newport?Leslie Knope,Three words: Ramp Up Pawnee.Leslie Knope,Pawnee is way behind the times in terms of making its buildings wheelchair accessible.Leslie Knope,"Not enough ramps is the number three complaint among Pawnee seniors Right behind ""everything hurts"" and ""I'm dying."""Ron Swanson,You wanted to see me.Ron Swanson,Good God.Ron Swanson,What the hell are you doing?Chris Traeger,Upsidedown situps.Chris Traeger,"Great exercise, and it literally lets me see the world from a different perspective."Ron Swanson,Isn't there a men's gymnasium where you could do that?Chris Traeger,"The world's my gymnasium, Ron."Chris Traeger,But I will stop if it makes you uncomfortable.Chris Traeger,Could you hold me while I dismount?Chris Traeger,Thanks so much.Ron Swanson,You bet.Chris Traeger,Question for you.Chris Traeger,"In a town of this size, the Parks department traditionally has ten employees."Chris Traeger,You have only seven.Chris Traeger,Why is that?Ron Swanson,I work hard to make sure my department is as small and ineffective as possible.Chris Traeger,The department is so small because Leslie Knope singlehandedly does the work of four people.Chris Traeger,And she's already scaled back her time.Chris Traeger,"If she wins, she'll be dividing her time between Parks and City Council."Chris Traeger,I'm going to have to hire a deputy director to pick up the slack.Ron Swanson,No!Ron Swanson,"Chris, that's unnecessary."Ron Swanson,The department is doing fine without Leslie.Chris Traeger,Then prove it.Chris Traeger,Complete one major project.Ron Swanson,"Either we complete a government project which is abhorrent to me, or we bring a new person into the department, which repulses me to my core."Ron Swanson,Reminds me of when my dad made me choose which of my pet calves to slaughter with my own hands for my sixth birthday.Ron Swanson,"I couldn't choose, so I slaughtered both of them."Ron Swanson,And they were delicious.Ben Wyatt,"Essentially, we're going to put a ramp on every building in town."Leslie Knope,"Like I always say, stairs are a young man's game."Ned Jones,Damn straight.Ned Jones,This is very impressive.Ned Jones,"You know, you remind me of my brother."Ned Jones,"You have the same name, Leslie."Ned Jones,He lost a third of his body in a motorcycle accident.Ned Jones,The middle third.Ned Jones,But they sutured the hell out of him.Ned Jones,He's he's fine now.Ned Jones,"Much shorter, but a goodlooking, young, flat man."Ned Jones,"What have you heard about Newport's new campaign manager, Jennifer Barkley?"Leslie Knope,"Uh, who?"Ned Jones,She wants to have a meeting with me at 5:00.Ned Jones,I told her sorry.Ned Jones,I don't talk politics after dinner.Leslie Knope,Oh my God Newport hired a real Washington hotshot.Ben Wyatt,"Wow, she worked with James Carville?"Ben Wyatt,She ran two Republican congressional campaigns and a Senate race.Leslie Knope,"Yeah, and check out this picture."Leslie Knope,She's eating egg salad with Colin Powell.Leslie Knope,That's the most impressive thing I've ever seen.Leslie Knope,Why are you smiling?Leslie Knope,Why is this terrifying information making you smile?Ben Wyatt,Newport's scared.Ben Wyatt,"I mean, he must've shelled out a fortune to hire her."Leslie Knope,So what do we do next?Ben Wyatt,I'm going to set up a meeting.Ben Wyatt,"I mean, we can size her up, but more importantly, it'll humanize you and make it harder for her to attack you."Ben Wyatt,And we'll do it at JJ's Diner.Ben Wyatt,Home field advantage.Leslie Knope,"As a candidate, I appreciate your strategic mind, but as woman, all I care about is your slight but powerful body."Ron Swanson,"Hello, Ann Perkins."Ann Perkins,This is the first time you've said my entire name correctly.Ron Swanson,Nonsense.Ron Swanson,We are close friends.Ron Swanson,I have good news for you.Ron Swanson,I'm making the water fountain hygiene upgrade our number one priority.Ann Perkins,"Oh, great."Ann Perkins,"For some reason, when people in Pawnee use the water fountain, they put their mouths completely over the spouts."Ann Perkins,"It's like this weird, disgusting, local quirk."Ann Perkins,"Kiss one water fountain drinker, you're kissing everyone in Pawnee."Ann Perkins,Including him.Ron Swanson,I'd like to complete this project by tomorrow.Ann Perkins,Oh.Ron Swanson,Set up shop in our office.Ron Swanson,"In fact, take Leslie's desk."Ann Perkins,"Okay, I will."Ann Perkins,Thanks.Ann Perkins,Great.April Ludgate,Do you want the door open or shut?Ann Perkins,"Ah, open's fine."April Ludgate,Okay.Leslie Knope,"Hello, Marta."Leslie Knope,"We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone."Extra,You mean Ms.Extra,Barkley.Extra,She's already here.Extra,Last booth.Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope.Jennifer Barkley,Hi.Jennifer Barkley,I'm Jen Barkley.Jennifer Barkley,Hi.Leslie Knope,Hi.Jennifer Barkley,Grab a seat.Ben Wyatt,Thanks.Jennifer Barkley,Sorry about all these papers.Jennifer Barkley,I had them shipped in.Jennifer Barkley,I'm a news junkie.Ben Wyatt,Is this in Arabic?Jennifer Barkley,"Well, I've been reading up on you two."Jennifer Barkley,"Ben, it's a great job on this campaign."Ben Wyatt,Oh.Ben Wyatt,"Well, thank you."Jennifer Barkley,"And Leslie, your Parks work, it's no joke."Jennifer Barkley,This is federal government caliber.Ben Wyatt,"Not to sound rude, but what are you doing here?"Ben Wyatt,This campaign seems beneath you.Jennifer Barkley,Yeah.Jennifer Barkley,Bobby Newport's daddy called me out of the blue.Jennifer Barkley,"I'd never heard of Bobby Newport before, but it became clear in two seconds this guy is a moron."Jennifer Barkley,"So I was, like, ""sorry, Nick."""Jennifer Barkley,Your son is a moron.Jennifer Barkley,There's no way.Jennifer Barkley,""" Then he offered me a crazy amount of money."Jennifer Barkley,I shouldn't even tell you how much.Jennifer Barkley,But I will.Jennifer Barkley,"$250,000.00 "Ben Wyatt,Good lord.Ben Wyatt,For six weeks of work?Jennifer Barkley,I know.Jennifer Barkley,"Plus frankly, I needed a break from Washington."Leslie Knope,Do you know Joe Biden?Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, mmhmm."Leslie Knope,He's on my celebrity sex list.Leslie Knope,"Well, he is my celebrity sex list."Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, trust me."Jennifer Barkley,You can do better than Joe.Leslie Knope,"Oh, no."Leslie Knope,I don't I don't think I can.Leslie Knope,No way.Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, man."Jennifer Barkley,I knew I shouldn't have met you guys.Jennifer Barkley,Now I kind of hope you win.Leslie Knope,She's just doing this for the money.Leslie Knope,She doesn't even like her own client.Leslie Knope,This could be the best case scenario for us.Ben Wyatt,Or the real best case scenario is if she just takes the money and doesn't even try.Perd Hapley,Tell me a little bit about Leslie Knope.Jennifer Barkley,"Well, Perd, Leslie Knope represents everything that is wrong about politics in America."Jennifer Barkley,"She's naive, she's untested, and she's an entrenched bureaucrat that's got the stink of big government all over her."Ben Wyatt,"Oh, God."Leslie Knope,What?Perd Hapley,"Wow, strong words from a powerful lady."Jennifer Barkley,So I guess we both agree.Jennifer Barkley,Leslie Knope is wrong for Pawnee.Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario.Leslie Knope,Worst case scenario!Extra,"I'm Leslie Knope and when I grow up, I want to be a unicorn princess or a city councilor."Extra,Wrong.Extra,"Not in my town, kid."Extra,City council's a real job for a real adult.Ben Wyatt,It's playing every hour on every channel.Leslie Knope,It's official.Leslie Knope,I hate Jennifer Barkley.Leslie Knope,"When I go to that senior center, I'm going to go up onstage, and I'm going to viciously attack her."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, don't let Barkley knock us off message."Ben Wyatt,"We are going there to get Ned Jones' endorsement,  and that's huge."Leslie Knope,You're right.Leslie Knope,"And I should listen to you always because you are a man genius with a taut, narrow frame like a sexy, elf king."Ben Wyatt,Do you wish I were taller or what's going on?Leslie Knope,Nothing.Leslie Knope,You're perfect.Ann Perkins,"Okay, everyone."Ann Perkins,So the Health department is working on a poster campaign to warn people about diseases.Ann Perkins,Now we are going to build a better water fountain for the parks.Ann Perkins,Andy is our official waterfountain tester.Andy Dwyer,"All right, let's give this sucker a testdrive."Ann Perkins,"Yeah, so the idea is to make a fountain that he can't do that to."Andy Dwyer,"Ah, that's good."Ann Perkins,"Okay, any ideas?"Ann Perkins,Jerry?Jerry Gergich,"Well, I was thinking that we could put this cage thing around it."Ann Perkins,Okay.Ann Perkins,That could work.Ann Perkins,Andy?Ann Perkins,Yeah.Ann Perkins,"Thank you, Andy."Andy Dwyer,"Ah, still good."Ann Perkins,Tom?Tom Haverford,Full disclosure.Tom Haverford,Ann and I are romantically intertwined.Ann Perkins,"Oh, God."Tom Haverford,So let's not be surprised if she picks my idea.Ann Perkins,"Would you just go, dummy?"Tom Haverford,What's the best kind of water fountain?Tom Haverford,How about no water fountain?Tom Haverford,This is the Voss Water Butler by Tumi.Tom Haverford,And only $600 a bag.Ann Perkins,"April, what's your idea?"April Ludgate,To go in that room and finish this book.Ann Perkins,"Oh, really?"April Ludgate,Yeah.Ann Perkins,Is it good?April Ludgate,Yeah.Ann Perkins,"You're going to stay here, and you're going to help."Ann Perkins,Donna?Donna Meagle,Do I look like I drink water?Leslie Knope,Yoohoo.Leslie Knope,I'm over here.Leslie Knope,Just about to start my presentation.Leslie Knope,"I uhoh, stairs."Leslie Knope,What do I do?Leslie Knope,How do I get from here to there?Leslie Knope,I'm not a professional mountain climber.Leslie Knope,"It's a real problem in our town, but not any more, thanks to Ramp Up Pawnee."Leslie Knope,"We're going to put ramps in every building in this town because if there's one thing I believe, it's that stairs are a young man's game."Extra,Yeah.Extra,Ramps are an idiot's game.Extra,This is nothing more than a worse version of Bobby Newport's plan.Leslie Knope,What plan?Leslie Knope,Bobby Newport doesn't have a plan.Jennifer Barkley,Was somebody just talking about Bobby Newport's plan?Jennifer Barkley,Because Ned Jones and I would love to share it with you.Jennifer Barkley,"Come on out here, Ned."Ned Jones,Ned Jones is here.Ned Jones,Say hello to Ned Jones.Ned Jones,Make way for Ned Jones.Donna Meagle,Why don't we just turn up the pressure?Donna Meagle,That way you don't have to put your mouth so close.Andy Dwyer,"All right, here we go."April Ludgate,"Ah, stop!"Andy Dwyer,"Honey, I'm sorry."Ann Perkins,That'll teach you to pay attention.April Ludgate,I have an idea.April Ludgate,"Um, I was thinking, ""what if we did ""something like this?"Ann Perkins,""" Oh, my dude, what the hell?"Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport's plan is called ""Rise Up!"Jennifer Barkley,Pawnee.Jennifer Barkley,""" He is going to put an electric lift on every outdoor staircase in town."Jennifer Barkley,Wow.Jennifer Barkley,"Now you could use a ramp, but that seems like a lot of work."Jennifer Barkley,"Bobby Newport thinks that the stairs should do the work for you, don't you agree?"Jennifer Barkley,Give him a hand.Ned Jones,"As President of Seniors United, I endorse Bobby Newport."Chris Traeger,I've started meeting with people to fill in for Leslie.Chris Traeger,I have found five candidates I'd like to hire and two I'd like to be lifelong friends with.Ron Swanson,"Well, you will not be hiring anyone because my department is just finishing up a major project."Andy Dwyer,Incoming!Andy Dwyer,Got you!Jerry Gergich,"Donna, don't!"Chris Traeger,Excuse me.Tom Haverford,"Help, everything I'm wearing is suede!"Tom Haverford,"Everything I'm wearing is suede, everything I'm wearing is suede!"Chris Traeger,"Excuse me, everybody."Ron Swanson,Attention!Chris Traeger,I think you'll agree that this department could use a little leadership.Andy Dwyer,Kamikaze!Jerry Gergich,Oh.Ben Wyatt,"""Stumbling for the first time in months, ""the Knope campaign seems to be rolling down ""a ramp to nowhere."Leslie Knope,""" We are getting our butts kicked by a guy who is not even in the country."Leslie Knope,He's making out with some floozy in Majorca.Ben Wyatt,"Sorry, I wish I was better at this."Ben Wyatt,Then you could be making out with some floozy in Majorca.Ben Wyatt,Maybe we take the fight to her?Ben Wyatt,"I mean I could try to get you on Perd's show, and you could tell him how she stole your idea."Leslie Knope,That sounds good.Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I'll just do that."Ben Wyatt,"I can call, or maybe I'll just go down there."April Ludgate,Hey.April Ludgate,Chris wants you in his office for the final round of interviews.April Ludgate,And sorry we goofed around so much.Ron Swanson,"Normally, I'd be very proud of you for what you did."Ron Swanson,This is a rare example where wasting a full day of work is a bad thing.April Ludgate,"Is there really going to be a weird, new person in the office?"Ron Swanson,I think so.Ron Swanson,"We may be in for a good, old fashioned shakeup."Leslie Knope,Jennifer Barkley.Leslie Knope,"You twofaced, carpetbagging"Jennifer Barkley,"Hi, Leslie."Jennifer Barkley,Good to see you.Leslie Knope,"Hi, nice to see you, too."Leslie Knope,"You are a twofaced, carpet"Jennifer Barkley,You want anything?Jennifer Barkley,Anything?Jennifer Barkley,It's on me.Jennifer Barkley,Everything in this town is so cheap.Leslie Knope,"I would never accept anything from a twofaced, carpetbagging "Jennifer Barkley,Leslie.Leslie Knope,Please.Leslie Knope,Let me get my insults out.Leslie Knope,I've been practicing it the whole way over here.Jennifer Barkley,I sense that you're angry.Jennifer Barkley,Tell me why.Leslie Knope,"Because you stole my idea, and yours won't even work."Leslie Knope,"Ramps are more practical, and they're less expensive than lifts."Leslie Knope,My idea is better.Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, I don't doubt it."Jennifer Barkley,The fact is I don't care.Jennifer Barkley,"Ramps, lifts, your plan, my plan I don't actually care about any of this."Jennifer Barkley,I'm just trying to win.Jennifer Barkley,"Look, it's not personal."Jennifer Barkley,I like you.Jennifer Barkley,But my job is to beat you.Jennifer Barkley,So have a seat.Jennifer Barkley,I'll get you some of those waffles you love.Leslie Knope,How do you know thatJennifer Barkley,It's my job to know.Leslie Knope,"God, you're good."Jennifer Barkley,I know.Chris Traeger,"Hi, guys."Chris Traeger,What's so imporant?Ann Perkins,"Well, after yesterday's hands on brainstorming session"Chris Traeger,Water balloon fight.Ann Perkins,Fair enough.Ann Perkins,We think we came up with a fountain idea that really works.Ann Perkins,Presenting the amazing spoutless fountain.Andy Dwyer,Huh?Andy Dwyer,What?April Ludgate,"We just removed the splash guard because if it's not there, you can't put your mouth on it."Andy Dwyer,"Well, I'll I'll try it."Andy Dwyer,I did it.April Ludgate,"Good job, babe."Chris Traeger,"Simple, elegant, and costeffective."Chris Traeger,"If your team keeps this up, I think we can hold off on filling the Leslie void."Donna Meagle,I think Ben's already filling the Leslie void.Donna Meagle,Oh!Ann Perkins,Oh!Chris Traeger,I'll give it up for that.Jennifer Barkley,So what's Ben's next move for you?Leslie Knope,"Oh, oh, I'm not going to tell you that."Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, let me guess."Jennifer Barkley,"Um, you're going to attack me."Jennifer Barkley,"You're going to go on that perm show again, so you could tell everyone that that ramp idea was yours."Leslie Knope,"It's ""Perd,"" first of all, and no."Leslie Knope,Maybe.Leslie Knope,No.Jennifer Barkley,That's not a terrible idea.Jennifer Barkley,"No, actually, it is kind of terrible because if you go on the air and tell everybody that I stole your idea"Leslie Knope,Which you did.Jennifer Barkley,"Which I did, everyone's going to think you're a sore loser, a goodygoody nerd."Jennifer Barkley,Because you know what people don't care about?Jennifer Barkley,They don't care about whose idea was first.Jennifer Barkley,They care about whose idea was best.Leslie Knope,"Well, let's say that that was our plan, which it isn't."Jennifer Barkley,"Mmhmm, okay."Leslie Knope,What would you do instead?Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, Leslie."Jennifer Barkley,I really shouldn't give you campaign advice.Leslie Knope,Right.Jennifer Barkley,"Ah, what the hell."Jennifer Barkley,"If you love chess, which I do, but you don't have anybody to play against, which I don't, then sometimes, you just gotta play yourself."Jennifer Barkley,You could attack the Newport plan for costing too much money.Jennifer Barkley,"No, but that would backfire because then we would just say, ""you can never spend too much on seniors."""Leslie Knope,Of course.Jennifer Barkley,You need to beat our idea.Jennifer Barkley,Come up with something better.Jennifer Barkley,I don't know.Jennifer Barkley,Maybe a free shuttle service for seniors.Jennifer Barkley,"All right, that could work."Leslie Knope,Wow.Extra,Waffles and a cappuccino.Jennifer Barkley,"Gracias, Marta."Leslie Knope,JJ's doesn't have a cappuccino maker.Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, it does now."Jennifer Barkley,I bought them one.Leslie Knope,Course you did.Ben Wyatt,You talked to Barkley without me?Leslie Knope,I wanted to tell her what a jerk she was.Leslie Knope,And then she guessed your plan immediately and demolished it.Ben Wyatt,"Okay, as a rule, you shouldn't take advice from your opponent's campaign manager."Leslie Knope,But what if she's right?Ben Wyatt,"Well, what if it's a trick?"Ben Wyatt,"I mean, maybe she thinks our original plan would work, and she convinced you to use her plan instead because she knows that won't work."Leslie Knope,"Or maybe she thinks that we think that she thinks that, so we won't do it."Leslie Knope,But she knows that I know that she knows that She's in our heads.Ben Wyatt,"I'm sorry, Leslie."Ben Wyatt,She's better at this than I am.Leslie Knope,"Hey, there is no one on Earth that I would rather go into battle with than you."Ben Wyatt,Really?Leslie Knope,Yes.Leslie Knope,"So tell me, what do we do, my campaign manager?"Ben Wyatt,I don't know.Leslie Knope,Okay.Ron Swanson,I'd like to talk about your future.Ann Perkins,Why are we on this bench?Ann Perkins,This is weird.Ron Swanson,You did a great job solving that problem today.Ron Swanson,The leadership you displayed has gotten me thinkingAnn Perkins,I didn't solve that problem.Ann Perkins,April did.Ron Swanson,Really?Ron Swanson, Why did she tell me you did?Ann Perkins," Because she's April, and she doesn't want you to think that she actually cares about something."Ann Perkins," If you're looking for someone to help fill in for Leslie, April's a pain in the ass, but she's clearly the answer."Ron Swanson, Perhaps you're right.Ann Perkins, Should I go?Ron Swanson,"Oh, you're still here?"Ron Swanson,Yes.Perd Hapley, Let's begin the show by starting it.Perd Hapley," Now, Leslie, you claim the Newport campaign stole one of your ideas."Leslie Knope," Well, uh They did, they stole our idea."Leslie Knope, We were working on the Ramp Up Pawnee initiative for many weeks.Jennifer Barkley," Oh, Perd."Jennifer Barkley, This is politics as usual.Jennifer Barkley," The fact is, Bobby Newport's plan is better for seniors, better for Pawnee."Leslie Knope," Well, our plan is more practical, and it's cheaper."Jennifer Barkley," There she goes again, Perd."Perd Hapley, I don't know

documentary filmmaker Ken Burns describes the national park system as a America's best idea.Extra,Way quicker.Leslie Knope,Okay.Leslie Knope,"Well, but you should watch that documentary."Leslie Knope,"Now I realize that you're drafting the new city budget, and I've heard that you're planning on reducing the parks funding by 8%."Leslie Knope,"Councilman Pillner, that cannot happen."Leslie Knope,I've gotten to know the city councilmen pretty well because of my campaign.Leslie Knope,"If you hear any of them talking about that ""blonde pain in the ass,"" that's me."Extra,"Leslie, that budget is all but finalized."Extra,I love building ships in bottles.Extra,"When the ship is done, I put a cork in it, put it on the shelf, and I move on."Leslie Knope,"Hold that cork, sir because I'm about to put an adorable face on your proposed cuts."Leslie Knope,Meet Melody Sternway.Leslie Knope,She's enrolled in five of our parks programs.Leslie Knope,Our department is the only thing

everyone!"April Ludgate,I'm April Ludgate and I will be filling in for Leslie while she runs for office.April Ludgate,So the new emergency protocol for the Parks department can be found in your binders.Extra,What exactly is the chain of command visavis onsite response?April Ludgate,"You know what, why don't we just say that whoever gets to the emergency first will be in charge?"Extra,"Okay, so if there's an explosion, say, in Ramset Park and someone from Sewage gets there first, they'd be in charge?"April Ludgate,I had no idea how terrible Leslie's job is.April Ludgate,She referred to this meeting as a nonstop thrill ride.April Ludgate,"I'm not quite sure, but Tom can answer that if What are you doing?"Tom Haverford,Just bouncing some business ideas off Russell Simmons on Twitter.Tom Haverford,Why?Extra,"All due respect, miss Ludgate, do you even know what you're doing here?"April Ludgate,"All due respect, Mr."April Ludgate,"hamster penis, but

Traeger,"Ron Swanson, it is my pleasure to inform you that you are a finalist for the job of Assistant City Manager."Ron Swanson,"Chris, I feel I should remind you that I do not believe that the position or the entire government should exist."Ron Swanson,"That said, you'd be a fool not to pick me."Ron Swanson,I will walk deeper into the belly of the beast if it means I'm able to further limit reckless government spending.Ron Swanson,"I mean, I have so many ideas."Ron Swanson,"Some are simple like ""take down traffic lights"" and ""eliminate the Post Office."""Ron Swanson,"The bigger ones will be tougher, like ""bring all of this crumbling to the ground."""Chris Traeger,There is one more step in the vetting process.Chris Traeger,"You and I will embark on a quick session of heart rate meditation, focusing on conscious breathing and opening the heart chakra."Ron Swanson,I'm not sure I'm interested in that.Ron Swanson,"No, I am sure."Ron Swanson,I am not interested in that.Chris Traeger,"Ron, you and I are very different people, and we have often been at odds."Chris Traeger,"It is crucial that you and I spend a day spiritually engaged, and consider what it would really mean to work together."Chris Traeger,"Trust me, you'll love it."Chris Traeger,I'll see you tomorrow.Chris Traeger,"Oh, wear your yoga pants."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I really wish we would've talked about this first."Leslie Knope,What could possibly be wrong about me saving the Parks department budget?Ben Wyatt,I don't know.Ben Wyatt,That's the point.Ben Wyatt,"You're thinking like a Parks department employee, not a city council candidate."Ben Wyatt,You're in a campaign literally.Ben Wyatt,Everything you do right now is politics.Leslie Knope,"Oh, really?"Leslie Knope,Is this politics?Ben Wyatt,Ow.Ben Wyatt,What is what is that?Ben Wyatt,What why did you do that?Leslie Knope,I'm in a good mood.Leslie Knope,Because the city councilor listened to me.Leslie Knope,It means I have some juice.Ben Wyatt,"Look, this might be a good thing."Ben Wyatt,But there's a reason we strategize  before we make decisions.Leslie Knope,Okay.Ben Wyatt,Okay.Ben Wyatt,"I'll make some calls, see where we are."Leslie Knope,Enjoying the view.Ben Wyatt,What is going on?Leslie Knope,I'm just really into you.Leslie Knope,"Gimme a spin, baby."April Ludgate,I hate doing Leslie's job.April Ludgate,I'm filling in for a person who smiles 90% of the time.April Ludgate,"Tom, can you please help me?"April Ludgate,Please?April Ludgate,Or just do it?Tom Haverford,"Come on, lil sparkle."Tom Haverford,Don't give up.Tom Haverford,What does Leslie always say?April Ludgate,"I don't know, weird stuff about waffles."Tom Haverford,"She says, ""you get out of a job what you put into it."""Tom Haverford, You just need to find a project you're passionate about.Tom Haverford,"For instance, I was incredible at naming drinks at the Snakehole Lounge because I care a great deal about signature beverages."Tom Haverford,The Beeryonce Knowles.Tom Haverford,"It's just a regular beer, but we put it in a sexyass mug."Tom Haverford,Pairs nicely with the Jayzima.Tom Haverford,We bought a bunch of zima when the factory shut down.April Ludgate,That sounds fun.April Ludgate,Maybe I should work at a bar.Tom Haverford,"Come on, there must be some aspect of this job you care about."Ron Swanson,Hello.Ron Swanson,Here are some papers Leslie requested.Ann Perkins,These are blank.Ron Swanson,Weird.Ron Swanson,"As long as I'm here, can I ask you a question?"Ron Swanson,Did you ever participate in meditation with Chris?Ann Perkins,"Oh, yeah."Ann Perkins,"When we dated, he made me do it every week."Ron Swanson,What am I in for here?Ann Perkins,"Okay, here's the deal."Ann Perkins,"It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead."Ann Perkins,Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants?Leslie Knope,Hey.Leslie Knope,So did Pillner finalize the budget?Leslie Knope,Are we okay?Ben Wyatt,We are the opposite of okay.Leslie Knope,What do you mean?Ben Wyatt,"To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter."Ben Wyatt,"The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs."Ben Wyatt,So they're closing it at the end of the week.April Ludgate,That's where Champion came from.Andy Dwyer,What will happen to all the other animals?Ben Wyatt,"Well, they'll be "Andy Dwyer,Fine.Ben Wyatt,No.Ben Wyatt,They'll beAndy Dwyer,No!Jerry Gergich,Guys.Jennifer Barkley,"Apparently, Leslie Knope wielded her insider influence and got Councilman Pillner to save her precious department, even though it meant closing the shelter."Jennifer Barkley,"Now I am not saying that Leslie Knope is a dog murderer, per se, I just think that her actions raise some questions."Jennifer Barkley,"Like, for example, is she a dog murderer?"Ben Wyatt,God.Perd Hapley,"Well, I don't know the answer to that, Jennifer, but your tone makes me think Yes."Jennifer Barkley,"Say your goodbyes, Pebble 'Cause ""Weswie"" Knope gonna kill you."Ben Wyatt,She got the perfect puppy for that shot.Ben Wyatt,She is good.Donna Meagle,"Leslie, there is a woman on the phone that says her daughter's scared to go to sleep because Leslie Knope's going to come murder her kitty."Leslie Knope,"Okay, we can fix this."Ben Wyatt,"Yes, we can."Ben Wyatt,"Tomorrow morning, we are going back to Pillner and telling him to cut the Parks budget."Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no."Leslie Knope,We can figure something else out.Ben Wyatt,Leslie!Leslie Knope,"Hey, honey, good morning."Leslie Knope,How did you sleep?Leslie Knope,I adopted 32 cats and dogs.Leslie Knope,Do you want pancakes?Leslie Knope,I'm gonna make pancakes.Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?Leslie Knope,What?Leslie Knope,Which one?Ben Wyatt,Is that a pig?Leslie Knope,You talking about this one?Leslie Knope,This one right here?Leslie Knope,"Yes, that is a pig."Chris Traeger,This is the best meditation center in the area.Ron Swanson,It doesn't look like much.Chris Traeger,"Actually, this strip mall has surprisingly decent chi."Chris Traeger,"Although, the smells from the Greek restaurant next door are not ideal."Chris Traeger,"But through this door lies a deep, serene quietude."Extra,"Excuse me, ladies."Extra,On your right.Chris Traeger,"After you, Ron."Chris Traeger,Now take in the vibe of the room and remain open of mind and of spirit.Chris Traeger,Now quietly sit behind me and let's join breath.Ron Swanson,I'll stand.Chris Traeger,Interesting technique.April Ludgate,"Andy, look at this little guy!"April Ludgate,He's such a little runt.April Ludgate,"Hey, there."Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Tom, look."Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I just had five cats on me at once!"Andy Dwyer,You wanna come in here and try to break my record?Tom Haverford,"That's okay, Andy, I think I'm gonna keep my distance."Tom Haverford,Don't want none of that animal dander interacting with this cashmere.Ben Wyatt,"What's your endgame here, my dear?"Leslie Knope,This is only temporary until I find a way to keep the shelter open without cutting the Parks budget.April Ludgate,"Hey, what if I threw together a pet adoption in one of our parks would that be cool?"Leslie Knope,"April, that would be the coolest thing since 'N Sync, Aerosmith, and Nelly performed together at the Super Bowl halftime show."April Ludgate,Ew.April Ludgate,I think I may have found a project I'd actually enjoy doing helping these cats and dogs.April Ludgate,They should be rewarded for not being people.April Ludgate,I hate people.Leslie Knope,"I'm very proud of you, April."Leslie Knope,"Meanwhile, you and I are gonna look at the town budget and we're gonna find something expendable."Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Ben, the pig ate your noise canceling headphones."Andy Dwyer,Pigs are awesome!Ron Swanson,"All told, we were in there about six hours."Ron Swanson,"And no, I was not meditating."Ron Swanson,"I just stood there, quietly breathing."Ron Swanson,There were no thoughts in my head whatsoever.Ron Swanson,My mind was blank.Ron Swanson,I don't know what the hell these other crackpots are doing.April Ludgate,"Jerry, the puppies are going to the bathroom everywhere."April Ludgate,We can't let people see that.April Ludgate,"I need you to continuously clean out the cages, okay?"Jerry Gergich,"You got it, boss."April Ludgate,Thank you.April Ludgate,"Donna, did you put the info sheets on all the cages?"Donna Meagle,Last one.April Ludgate,Great.Donna Meagle,"Each animal has a photo, special talents, and a personal history That I made up."Donna Meagle,A lot of these dogs have rescued people from burning buildings.Donna Meagle,This one helped Ray Charles around.Andy Dwyer,What?Andy Dwyer,This cat was in Boogie Nights?April Ludgate,Hi.April Ludgate,You like this little guy?Extra,He's so cute.April Ludgate,I know.April Ludgate,All the animal are uptodate on their shots.April Ludgate,And I think he likes you.Andy Dwyer,He's pretty awesome.Andy Dwyer,Did you know his greatgrandfather was Spuds Mackenzie?Extra,"What do you think, sweetie?"Extra,Do you wanna take him home?Extra,"Yes, please."Ben Wyatt,"Realistically, I'm guessing we dropped three to five points in the polls."Ben Wyatt,"This late in the game, it's killer."Ben Wyatt,And that's a dog biscuit.Leslie Knope,Andy put them on the table 'cause he wanted to try to have the dogs play poker.Ben Wyatt,"Okay, Leslie, we are out of time."Ben Wyatt,We have to go back to them.Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God!"Leslie Knope,This is it.Ben Wyatt,Hmm.Extra,"Oh, for God's sake, Leslie."Extra,There's just not enough money to do all the things you wanna do.Extra,You're trying to fit two ships into one bottle.Extra,"Take it from me, you can't do that."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, just look at this."Ben Wyatt,"There are three employees designated as D1, or on retainer."Ben Wyatt,Public Works is still paying them even though they haven't worked in two years.Leslie Knope,It's an oversight.Leslie Knope,We get rid of them and we have just enough money to keep the animal shelter operating while still maintaining the Parks budget.Extra,Interesting.Leslie Knope,Looks like we found a bigger bottle.Extra,"I know you're just making a joke, but using a bigger bottle would be considered cheating by most of our major trade publications."Extra,FYI.Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've radiated mindfulness."Chris Traeger,What were you thinking about?Ron Swanson,I wasn't thinking at all.Chris Traeger,Incredible.Chris Traeger,"It takes a ton of work for me to get to that kind of a clear head space, no matter how hard I try."Ron Swanson,Don't try so hard.Chris Traeger,Don't try so hard.Chris Traeger,"Ron, I'm going to try your ""not trying"" method right here, right now."Ron Swanson,"Chris, wait."Ron Swanson,"I know this crap is important to you, so I should come clean."Ron Swanson,I got nothing out of that experience at all.Ron Swanson,So if you're looking for someone who enjoys meditationChris Traeger,"Oh, I didn't expect you to enjoy it."Chris Traeger,My one reservation about you as a coworker was that you seem inflexible.Chris Traeger,"And merely by agreeing to an activity you're not interested in, you showed flexibility."Chris Traeger,"Ron, you've got the job."Chris Traeger,You wanna head back?Ron Swanson,I do.Ron Swanson,"But first, there's a hot, spinning cone of meat in that Greek restaurant next door."Ron Swanson,"I don't know what it is, but I'd like to eat the whole thing."April Ludgate,Why is it so dead?April Ludgate,Where is everyone?Tom Haverford,Don't give up yet.Tom Haverford,There's a few minutes left.Extra,Is this where we drop off our unwanted cats?April Ludgate,No.April Ludgate,It's the opposite.Extra,Okay.Extra,I'm just gonna put these here for a second.Extra,"And then, uh"Andy Dwyer,We ended up with more animals than we started with.April Ludgate,This is what happens when you try.April Ludgate,All of these animals are gonna die.April Ludgate,God!April Ludgate,"I hope you're happy, stupid people in this stupid town!"April Ludgate,Hey!April Ludgate,"Hey, you!"April Ludgate,Get back here and get your [Bleep] cats out of there!Leslie Knope,Do you think Barack and Michelle Obama feel like this at the end of the day?Ben Wyatt,Probably.Ben Wyatt,"I mean, I don't know how else wait a second."Ben Wyatt,Is that so am I Michelle?Ann Perkins,"Hey, how is everyone?"Leslie Knope,Great!Ben Wyatt,Pretty good.Leslie Knope,We saved the animal shelter and the Parks budget.Ann Perkins,That's great news.Ann Perkins,Let me guess.Ann Perkins,You found room in other parts of the budget somewhere?Leslie Knope,Totally.Leslie Knope,Got rid of a bunch of lameass D1's from Public Works.Ann Perkins,Awesome news.Ann Perkins,"Hey, you know what else is pretty neat, is thanks to you, councilman Pillner went through the budget and decided that not just Public Works but all D1's will be terminated in two weeks."Ann Perkins,I'm getting fired.Leslie Knope,what now?Chris Traeger,Oh!Chris Traeger,Councilman Houser I was just looking for you.Chris Traeger,I have found my assistant city manager.Chris Traeger,You wanna guess who it is?Chris Traeger,It's Ron Swanson!Chris Traeger,I'm sorry.Chris Traeger,I should've let you guess.Chris Traeger,I'm just so excited.Councilman Houser,I'd put a pin in this for now.Chris Traeger,Why?Chris Traeger,Why pin it?Councilman Houser,The council vote is three to two in favor of another term for you.Councilman Houser,But one of the yes votes is retiring.Councilman Houser,"If Bobby Newport wins, he's gonna try to bring in his own guy."Chris Traeger,Why would he do that?Councilman Houser,He's not exactly thrilled you've been volunteering for the Knope campaign in your spare time.Councilman Houser,"Sorry, Chris."Councilman Houser,If Newport wins You're gone.Leslie Knope,I just need one more week.Leslie Knope,And then I think Extra,"Sorry, could you please Be careful?"Andy Dwyer,"Oh, I am always careful."Andy Dwyer,We're good.Leslie Knope,"If I could just get a little bit more time, I could figure out how to fix this."Extra,"Unfortunately, I cannot give you any more time."Leslie Knope,With due respectExtra,"Leslie, I am retiring at the end of this term, so I've been fine with you guys pushing me around on this budget thing."Extra,"But if you're ever gonna hold this job, there's something you need to understand."Extra,City Council isn't about making everybody in town happy.Extra,"In fact, every decision you make is gonna make a lot of people very unhappy."Extra,We play with live ammo around here.Extra,Now I'm gonna close the book on this budget draft by the end of the business day.Extra,So if you can find some way out of this mess by 5:00 P.M.Extra,you let me know.Leslie Knope,Thank you.Ben Wyatt,That's fair.Andy Dwyer,I did it!Andy Dwyer,I got it out.Extra,"Oh, geez."Extra,You don't take the ship out.Andy Dwyer,Here you go.Ron Swanson,Chris!Ron Swanson,Great news!Ron Swanson,I found a way to reduce government spending by 85%.Ron Swanson,Here's a hint no more departments.Chris Traeger,"Ha, that crazy and impractical plan may have to wait."Chris Traeger,"Turns out that Bobby Newport, if he beats Leslie, is going to appoint his own city manager."Chris Traeger,So I may have offered you a job that I have no authority to offer.Chris Traeger,I'm so so sorry.Ron Swanson,"Well, that is disappointing."Ron Swanson,But don't worry about me.Ron Swanson,I'll be fine.Chris Traeger,"Oh, I know."Chris Traeger,"I mean, in the grand scheme of things, who cares?"Chris Traeger," We're all just molecules, floating around in random patterns Devoid of meaning."Chris Traeger," Well, I'll see you when I see you."Chris Traeger, I'm a rolling stone.Chris Traeger,Peace.Ron Swanson,Stop.Ron Swanson, Have a seat.Ron Swanson," We did things your way, now we're gonna do it my way."Ron Swanson, Prepare to experience true freedom and bliss.Ann Perkins," Oh, maybe I should just go back to being a nurse full-time."Leslie Knope," No, I will not let you return to a life of shaving wieners and dodging knife attacks from meth heads."Ann Perkins, Right.Ann Perkins," Okay, what are you gonna do?"Ben Wyatt,"Well, either you get fired, the Parks budget shrinks, or the animal shelter's gotta go."Leslie Knope, Or we find money somewhere else.Ben Wyatt," Okay, Leslie, there is nowhere else."Ben Wyatt," This is a town budget, not a bottomless trust fund."Ben Wyatt, Okay? Money doesn't just appear out of nowhere.Leslie Knope,Shh.Leslie Knope, Stop talking.Ben Wyatt,What?Leslie Knope,Shh.Leslie Knope, I have half an idea and I'm putting it together.Ben Wyatt,Okay.Leslie Knope,Hey! Ann Perkins,Do you wannaLeslie Knope, Heh.Leslie Knope,I'm No!Ann Perkins,Do you? Unh.Leslie Knope, Shh.Leslie Knope," Okay, now I have a complete idea."Leslie Knope," Ben, I'm going to commit political suicide."Tom Haverford," Hey, it's me."Tom Haverford, Tommy!April Ludgate,I'm not here.Tom Haverford, April.April Ludgate, Swear on my great-great-grandmother's grave I'm not here.Tom Haverford, I'm gonna come in for a second.April Ludgate, Can you just leave me alone?Tom Haverford,"Why so glum, sugar plum?"April Ludgate," Um, I don't know."April Ludgate, Maybe because I worked so hard on that dumb pet adoption and I failed.April Ludgate, That's why it's stupid to work hard.Tom Haverford, Let me show you something.Tom Haverford," Because you worked hard, this little terribly-dressed girl has a puppy."Tom Haverford, And this little puppy has a home.Tom Haverford," If Leslie's taught me anything, it's that yes, this job is frustrating and you hit brick walls."Tom Haverford," But the other 2%, it's stuff like this kid."Tom Haverford, And that puppy.Tom Haverford, What what is that photo? That must come preloaded in there or something.April Ludgate," - Oh, my God."Tom Haverford, - See you at work tomorrow?April Ludgate,Fine.Tom Haverford, All right.Tom Haverford," Bye, pups! Bye, little piggies!"Chris Traeger,"I don't usually poison my body with dark alcohol, but this whiskey is excellent!"Ron Swanson,Nectar of the gods.Chris Traeger," Well, I should get back to my office."Chris Traeger, As long as I have one.Ron Swanson," Chris, I'm not one for positive thinking or visualization or meditation or really anything in the world that you believe in."Ron Swanson, But you might consider the upside of losing your job.Chris Traeger, For example?Ron Swanson,"You would no longer be a government parasite, sucking the lifeblood from honest, hardworking people."Ron Swanson," Instead, you'd contribute to society like a man."Ron Swanson, That's just one way it might be good.Ron Swanson, I'm sure there are others.Chris Traeger, I'm sure there are.Jennifer Barkley, Uh-oh.Jennifer Barkley, You look serious.Jennifer Barkley, What's on the agenda?Leslie Knope,"Just one item, Jennifer."Leslie Knope, You're going to announce that Bobby Newport will use his personal fortune to save the animal shelter.Jennifer Barkley, No.Jennifer Barkley," No, that's that's, um that is a great idea."Jennifer Barkley," In fact, I don't know why I hadn't thought of it already."Jennifer Barkley, Damn it.Jennifer Barkley, Damn it! I swear the air in this town is killing my brain cells.Leslie Knope," Actually, the water's not good for you either."Leslie Knope, You shouldn't drink the tap water.Leslie Knope, Has anyone told you that yet?Ben Wyatt,"In exchange, no more puppy killer ads for the rest of the campaign."Ben Wyatt,That's all we ask.Jennifer Barkley, Okay.Jennifer Barkley," Well, what's to stop me from just paying for the shelter and still running the ads?"Leslie Knope,"Because I told councilman Pillner that if you don't agree to our terms, he should cut the Parks budget."Ben Wyatt," And we'll leak that it was Leslie's decision and yours seem tough and fair, what with sacrificing her old department"Jennifer Barkley," Okay, what's in it for you? "Leslie Knope,"A safe home for the animals, a job for my friend, and a full Parks budget."Jennifer Barkley, I wasn't born yesterday.Jennifer Barkley, You've gotta have an angle.Jennifer Barkley, This is a home run for us! We're gonna dominate the news cycle for a whole week.Ben Wyatt," Well, you can have this week."Ben Wyatt, We'll take the next one.Jennifer Barkley," Oh, yeah? What makes you so sure?"Leslie Knope,"Because in a week, we have a debate."Leslie Knope," And your guy Bobby Newport is gonna have to show up, and he's gonna have to open his mouth."Leslie Knope, And I'm gonna kick his ass.Leslie Knope, She'll take care of that.Leslie Knope, See ya next week!Chris Traeger,How's my best buddy?

Knope,"Okay, Ben, what do we do?"Ben Wyatt,"Okay, it's unfortunate, but the stakes are too high."Ben Wyatt,We can't just stop campaigning.Ben Wyatt,"We stop, we lose."Leslie Knope,"Good answer, great body."Leslie Knope,"Ann, try to beat what he said."Ann Perkins,I'm not going to beat him.Leslie Knope,Not with that attitude.Ann Perkins,"Okay, fine."Ann Perkins,I think you should stop.Ann Perkins,At least until you apologize to Bobby in person.Leslie Knope,April?April Ludgate,"I wasn't listening, but I strongly disagree with Ann."Leslie Knope,Andy?Andy Dwyer,If the if the guy if Okay.Chris Traeger,I absolutely think that we should keep campaigning.Chris Traeger,"The worst possible thing we could do would be to stop, because if the campaign stops, we all stop."Chris Traeger,And stopping is certain death.Chris Traeger,Who wants a panini?Chris Traeger,Anyone?Chris Traeger,Everyone?Chris Traeger,I'm going to say everyone.Leslie Knope,All right.Ann Perkins,"All

publicity.Bill,I can just pay for it.Bill,"With my $10,000."Tom Haverford,"Look, I ain't gonna try to play a player."Tom Haverford,You're trying to get beaucoup bucks just like the rest of us.Tom Haverford,So how about this?Tom Haverford,I have a business idea for a gourmet alcoholic yogurt.Tom Haverford,I call it Yogurt platinum.Tom Haverford,I'll let you in on the ground floor.Tom Haverford,"And let me tell you, it's going to be worth way more than 10 grand."Bill,"Yeah, but now that I know your bad idea, I can start the company myself."Bill,"With my $10,000."Tom Haverford,"No, you can't do that!"Tom Haverford,Ron!Ron Swanson,"Tom, Donna, could you please give us a moment?"Ron Swanson,"I'd like to talk to Bill, man to man."Tom Haverford,He's gonna steal

Groffle, the awful Waffle, a book that I wrote and published on behalf of my education initiative."Leslie Knope,Any questions?Leslie Knope,Yes?Extra,How did Groffle cross the syrup river?Extra,And why did you call Mr.Extra,Newport a jerk?Leslie Knope,"Ah well, I should not have called Nick Newport a jerk, because we need to be respectful of all dead people."Leslie Knope,"I mean, not Stalin or Hitler, but I'm not calling Nick Newport Hitler."Extra,Ms.Extra,"Knope, I have a followup to what I'm now deciding to call ""jerkgate."""Extra,Are there any other deceased members of Bobby Newport's family you'd like to attack?Extra,And quit ducking the waffle question.Extra,Did Groffle use a boat of some kind?Ben Wyatt,"All right, that's all the questions for now."Ben Wyatt,"Thank you, everybody."Extra,Are we to assume that he swam across the syrup river?Extra,Ms.Extra,Knope!Leslie Knope,I'm never going to get away from these Nick Newport questions.Ann Perkins,It's obvious what you need to do.Ann Perkins,You have to apologize to Bobby and stop campaigning.Ben Wyatt,"Okay, fine."Ben Wyatt,"We go to Bobby Newport, you apologize"Ann Perkins,Good.Ben Wyatt,"And then we leak the details to the press, which restores your reputation and buys us enough time  to finish the bus tour."Leslie Knope,Nice.Ann Perkins,"No, that's not a real apology."Ann Perkins,It's just sneaky.Ann Perkins,I don't like it.Leslie Knope,"Ann, for once, this is not about you."Leslie Knope,A man is dead.Ron Swanson,"Look, friend, I respect your slavish devotion to the free market, but you can't welch on a contract."Ron Swanson,"Where I come from, a man's word is sacred."Bill,"Okay, what's your stance on pinky swears, George Washington?"BIll,I'm taking the money.Ron

Swanson,Why?BIll,"Look, I own a fleet of 22 crappy white vans, and for some reason there's a massive bidding war going on over them."Bill,"Now for a guy whose only assets are 22 crappy white vans, it's pretty much a dream scenario, so I'm just going to ride this out, see where it takes me."Bill,"And now it's 15,000."Ben Wyatt,"Okay, I talked Newport's people into giving us ten minutes alone with Bobby, so we get in there, we apologize, and then we get back on the campaign trail."Leslie Knope,"Okay, how do we leak this to the press?"Leslie Knope,"Do we, like, release a statement?"Leslie Knope,Do we call somebody?Ann Perkins,"Um, I don't think that's going to be a problem."Leslie Knope,"Oh, my God, why are there so many people here?"Ben Wyatt,It's a trap.Ben

situation into a political sideshow.Jennifer Barkley,"Oh, come on, you guys were only going to apologize for the press."Leslie Knope,"No way, that's not us."Leslie Knope,You don't know us at all.Ben Wyatt,It's rude to say it.Leslie Knope,We wouldn't even think it.Ann Perkins,"Yeah, that's a ridiculous claim."Leslie Knope,"We brought a ""sorry for your loss"" fruit basket for Bobby."Leslie Knope,And it is very classy.Leslie Knope,"No melon, no apples."Jennifer Barkley,"You were going to use us, and we just turned the tables on you."Jennifer Barkley,'Cause I'm smarter and faster.Jennifer Barkley,That is not a judgment.Jennifer Barkley,That's just a fact.Jennifer Barkley,"We're both just doing whatever it takes to win, right?"Jennifer Barkley,I love polka

try.Chris Traeger,April.Chris Traeger,"I just got Champion his dog food, cleaned your house, filed that paperwork you're officially April Ludgate Dwyer, installed a smoke detector, and now I'm back."Chris Traeger,What's next?April Ludgate,"Nothing, Chris."April Ludgate,Just sit down somewhere and stop bothering me.Chris Traeger,I can't.Chris Traeger,I've had a very tough year.Chris Traeger,I can't stop thinking about Ann and Millicent.Chris Traeger,"And if I'm alone with my thoughts, I go to a dark place."April Ludgate,"Okay, first of all, dark places are awesome."April Ludgate,"Secondly, Ann is kind of lame, so way to dodge a bullet."April Ludgate,"And Millicent is Jerry's daughter, so two bullets."April Ludgate,And you're not alone.April Ludgate,You've got lots of friends.April Ludgate,Somewhere.April Ludgate,I assume.April Ludgate,You're going to be just fine.Chris Traeger,Thank you.Chris Traeger,You're right.Chris Traeger,I'll be fine.Chris

I'm really sorry your dad died, and I'm really, really sorry I called him a jerk."Bobby Newport,That's okay.Bobby Newport,"He was, like, a million years old."Bobby Newport,And he was kind of a jerk.Bobby Newport,"The only reason I did this campaign was to impress him, and he couldn't have cared less."Leslie Knope,"You know, my mom was a great athlete when she was a kid."Leslie Knope,"So in junior high, I joined the track team to impress her, even though I hated it."Leslie Knope,"And at the end of the year, I ran the 5,000 meters in this huge track event."Leslie Knope,And I finished dead last.Leslie Knope,And I thought that she was going to be really disappointed in me.Leslie Knope,But she wasn't.Leslie Knope,"She ran up to me, and she wrapped me up in this big hug, and she told me she had never been more proud of me."Bobby Newport,"Thanks, Leslie."Bobby Newport,That's a great story.Bobby Newport,"I'm not 100% sure I get the point, but"Leslie Knope,"You finished this race, Bobby."Leslie Knope," The campaign is over, and you finished."Leslie Knope," Win or lose, I bet you anything that your dad was proud of you."Bobby Newport, Now I get it.Leslie Knope, There you go.Bobby Newport, Your mom and my dad are both dicks.Tom Haverford," There's no vans within 50 miles, and, for some reason, no one wants to lend me $10,000."Ron Swanson," Even if we had the

Macklin, you son of a bitch."Bobby Newport, A lot of people have been asking me how I feel about everything that's happened today.Bobby Newport," Well, let me tell you a little story."Bobby Newport, My dad was this amazing athlete when he was a kid.Bobby Newport," When I was in junior high, I started doing track just to impress him Even though I hated it."Bobby Newport," At the end of the year, I entered the 5,000 meters."Bobby Newport, And I won.Bobby Newport, It was awesome.Bobby Newport," My dad wrapped me in a big hug, said he was proud of me."Bobby Newport, That's just a great story that happened between me and my dad and nobody else.Ben Wyatt," Oh, we're dead."Ben Wyatt,It's over.Leslie Knope,That's my story.Bobby Newport," Before I go, I want to bring up a special guest."Bobby Newport, Somebody who's been very supportive and mega cool today.Bobby Newport, Leslie Knope.Bobby Newport, Will you come up here?Leslie Knope,What?Bobby Newport,"Come on, come up here."Ben Wyatt,"Go, go, go, go, go."Bobby Newport,"You know, Leslie's been getting a lot of heat today, but I want you all to know that we talked person-to-person, and she's really great."Bobby Newport, People should stop being so mean to her.Bobby Newport," In fact, if you don't vote for me tomorrow, you should vote for her, because she's super, super awesome lady."Bobby Newport," Leslie, we did it!"Bobby Newport,Yeah!Ann Perkins,Maybe we're not dead.Jennifer Barkley," Chris, right? Hi, I'm Jen."Chris Traeger, Hello.Jennifer Barkley," You know, there are 30 bedrooms in this house. Bobby's in one, there's a dead guy in another, the rest are free."Jennifer Barkley, What do you say?Chris Traeger,Oh!

great job, but I think Leslie wants me to stay."Ben Wyatt,What would you do?Ron Swanson,"Well, I've never been one for meeting new people or doing new things or eating new types of food or traveling outside of southern Indiana."Ron Swanson,"I've had the same haircut since 1978, and I've driven the same car since 1991."Ron Swanson,I've used the same wooden comb for three decades.Ron Swanson,I have one bowl.Ron Swanson,I still get my milk delivered by horse.Ben Wyatt,You do?Ron Swanson,But you and Leslie like to hold hands and jump off of cliffs together into the great unknown.Ron Swanson,You two have a good relationship.Ron Swanson,"I don't personally know what that's like, but I'm given to understand that means you're going to land on your feet."Ben Wyatt,So you really want things to just stay exactly the same?Ben Wyatt,"But if Leslie wins, you get my old job, assistant city manager, right?"Ron Swanson,Seems that way.Ben Wyatt,Then good luck to the both of us.Ben

takebacks, partner."Ann Perkins,"After the first day, we realized we had made a huge mistake."Tom Haverford,Huge.Ann Perkins,"However, everyone was being so smug about it, saying there's no way it would last, so we're pretending to still be together."Ann Perkins,"That way, no one gets the satisfaction of being right, even though they are, but still."Tom Haverford,"More importantly, I bet Donna 1,000 dollars that we'd be together for another month."Tom Haverford,I can't stress this enough.Tom Haverford,"If she finds out that we broke up, I'll go bankrupt."Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."Ann Perkins,Food.Ann Perkins,Food.Ron Swanson,"Yes, I am returned."Ron Swanson,No.Ron Swanson,"Not so fast, Shirley."Ron Swanson,"I just have to thaw the meat, season it, and grill it

Wyatt,Best thing to do is distract them with innocuous talk  about the stuff they care about.Leslie Knope,"Great, like what?"Ben Wyatt,"Well, they're white people from Minnesota, so hockey, fishing,

I don't know, his friends are getting married, and he's not dating anyone."Andy Dwyer,Why isn't he dating anyone?April Ludgate,"Yeah, why don't you date him?"Ann Perkins,"Because I'm dating myself right now, okay?"Ann Perkins,I'mI'm trying to figure out how to make me happy.April Ludgate,"Ugh, why is it always about you, Ann?"April Ludgate,Self centered much?Ann Perkins,"Just go, okay?"Ann

parks per capita than most cities.April Ludgate,"Pawnee only has two dog parks this one and that one, which is also an active parking lot."Leslie Knope,"Can you say ""per capita"" again?"Leslie Knope,"I want to take a picture of you saying ""per capita."""April Ludgate,Stop.Leslie Knope,I am so proud of you.Leslie Knope,Now stand next to the screen and think about all the strong female role models in your life.April Ludgate,Gross.Leslie Knope,April came to me with an idea to build a dog park in Pawnee.Leslie Knope,"I recognized her potential a long time ago, and she's finally living up to it."Leslie Knope,"I mean, I am so proud of her, I could cry."Leslie Knope,And here we go.Leslie Knope,One tiny critique.Leslie Knope,"If you do want to be taken seriously, you might want to think a little bit about how you present yourself."April Ludgate,"No, this is publicity for Orin's new performance art show."April Ludgate,He's an animal living on a human farm.April Ludgate,And you can go and feed him from your own hand.Leslie Knope,"Ugh, that's horrifying, and so is Orin."Leslie Knope,You should not be friends with him.April Ludgate,"So, after reviewing all the options, I found that the best location for the dog park is Lot 48, the one behind Ann's house."Leslie Knope,No.Leslie Knope,"No, no, no, no, no, no."Leslie Knope,I've been trying to put a park there for four years.Leslie Knope,"See, the thing is, April, that lot is mine."Leslie Knope,"I've been doing slow, painstaking work so I don't want to whip out the legalese on you now, but I got dibs."Leslie Knope,"What we are gonna do is we're gonna take your enthusiasm, we're gonna bundle it up, and we're gonna find a new place for a dog park."Leslie Knope,Doesn't that sound fun?Leslie Knope,"One, two, three, cheese."Leslie Knope,Good girl.Jerry Gergich,"Good morning, Andy."Andy Dwyer,"Okay, something is different about my computer."Andy Dwyer,Aha.Andy Dwyer,It's gone.Andy Dwyer,A game is the foot.Andy Dwyer,"See, part of the police academy entrance exam is investigating a crime."Andy Dwyer,"So about a month ago I told everyone in the office that, at some point, they should steal something from my desk so I could practice."Andy Dwyer,Let's do this.Andy Dwyer,"Wait, hey, did you guys take my glasses too?"Andy Dwyer,They got my sunglasses too.Donna Meagle,I was in Miami last weekend.Donna Meagle,I took my talents to South Beach.Andy Dwyer,How do you spend your time in Miami?Andy Dwyer,Maybe fencing stolen computers?Donna Meagle,"Yes, I took your government computer from Indiana to Miami to sell it on the black market for 150 bucks."Andy Dwyer,"Haha, you don't know it, but you just gave yourself away."Ben Wyatt,"Gotta say, I'm impressed."Ben Wyatt,"Your mission statement made sense, and you didn't use one R. Kelly lyric."Tom Haverford,Yes.Tom Haverford,So you want to be my CFO?Ben Wyatt,"Well, I already have a job, but I'll help as a friend."Ben Wyatt,As long as you take what I say seriously.Ben Wyatt,I don't want another Entertainment 720 disaster on our hands.Tom Haverford,"Yeah, it was a disaster."Tom Haverford,Too bad we didn't see it coming.Tom Haverford,"All right, what's my first move?"Leslie Knope,"You know, I think any of the four previous locations would work, but there's something about this place."Leslie Knope,"It just has a really good energy here, you know?"Leslie Knope,lots of natural light.April Ludgate,It's tiny and awful and loud.April Ludgate,"And it's zone 14B, industrial waste cleanup site."April Ludgate,We should technically be wearing Hazmat suits right now.Ann Perkins,It seems like the kind of place a ska band would go to shoot heroin.Leslie Knope,"Come on, guys, this is a great place for a dog park."Leslie Knope,"I mean, look, there's already a dog here."Ann Perkins,"Oh, my God."Ann Perkins,I had that exact doll when I was a kid.Ann Perkins,This is this is traumatic for me.April Ludgate,"Well, I'm sorry, but lot 48 is the only one that works."April Ludgate,And I'm definitely bringing it up at the next city council meeting.Leslie Knope,"April, please, I beg of you, I will do anything to keep you from doing that."April Ludgate,Okay.April Ludgate,Saw off your pinky toe.Leslie Knope,No.April Ludgate,Shave your head.Leslie Knope,No.April Ludgate,Have sex with Jerry.Leslie Knope,No.April Ludgate,"Well, I tried to be reasonable."Leslie Knope,I have created a monster.Leslie Knope,And now I need to destroy her.Leslie Knope,"What do I do, Joe?"Leslie Knope,"Well, Leslie, look into my eyes, take a deep breath, and everything will be fine."Leslie Knope,"Thanks, Joe."Leslie Knope,"God, he's good."Leslie Knope,"Ron, thank you for agreeing to see me."Ron Swanson,I didn't.Ron Swanson,You just walked in here and started talking.Leslie Knope,I don't have time for a history lesson.Leslie Knope,"Look, I am trying to remove parking meters, and there is a guy in Public Works who's being a real thorn about it."Ron Swanson,Which guy?Leslie Knope,Ricky Jordache.Ron Swanson,Never heard of him.Ron Swanson,What's his deal?Leslie Knope,He's new.Leslie Knope,"He used to be a slacker, but now he's realizing his full potential, but at what cost?"Leslie Knope,"He's smart, and he's beautiful, and I think of him in many ways as a daughter, but that would be crazy 'cause he's a man and his name's Ricky."Leslie Knope,Here's my question.Leslie Knope,How did you used to slow me down when I was becoming too meish?Ron Swanson,Sometimes I'd just give you busy work.Ron Swanson,I once had you put together a brochure about different kinds of Indiana topsoil.Leslie Knope,That soil brochure was not busy work.Leslie Knope,"I mean, people still refer to Mulch Ado About Nothing."Ron Swanson,"And if you were particularly amped up about a project, I'd take you to JJ's and distract you with waffles."Leslie Knope,Those were distraction waffles?Leslie Knope,I thought they were friendship waffles.Ron Swanson,Breakfast food can serve many purposes.Leslie Knope,"But what if this person, this Ricky, who is real, doesn't like waffles or anything."Ron Swanson,Everybody has something they're passionate about.Ron Swanson,"Just figure out what it is, express an interest in it, and divert his attention."Extra,"Howdy, neighbors."Extra,Welcome to human farm.Extra,Here's your animal feed.Extra,Please don't feed the animals.Leslie Knope,"Wow, this is really, really cool."Leslie Knope,"I like the statement it's making that, you know, we're all in cages in a way."April Ludgate,"Yeah, it's actually about death and the city."Leslie Knope,Yeah.Leslie Knope,I see that now.Leslie Knope,"Hi, Orin."Ben Wyatt,"Ms. Wicks, if you've read our proposal, you'll see that an alliance between RentASwag and Sweetums could be mutually beneficial."Jessica Wicks,"Well, I must say it's a much better idea than the last one you had, that gourmet French food thing."Tom Haverford,"Oh, my escargot delivery service, Snail Mail."Tom Haverford,So you want to partner up and make history?Tom Haverford,"I mean, you've already made history as the world's most beautiful CEO."Jessica Wicks,"I'm really sorry, cutie."Jessica Wicks,The company's laying low right now due to a small mishap.Ben Wyatt,"Ah, yes."Ben Wyatt,"The Sweetums molasses storage vat exploded, resulting in a slow moving ecological disaster."Tom Haverford,"Well, all press is good press."Ben Wyatt,"No, this was bad press."Ben Wyatt,A lot of homes were very gradually flooded.Jessica Wicks,People died.Jessica Wicks,"Actually, speaking of, we're starting up a nonprofit foundation to restore our name."Jessica Wicks,Any interest in running it?Ben Wyatt,"Oh, I'm I'm sorry, you want me to run your nonprofit wing?"Jessica Wicks,"I know that Bobby Newport is my stepson, but the work you did on Leslie's campaign was amazing."Jessica Wicks,Your name is on our short list.Tom Haverford,"Just to clarify, it's a no to me on all fronts, and you're offering Ben a job?"Jessica Wicks,Yeah.Tom Haverford,Cool.Tom Haverford,Cool.Andy Dwyer,"Been looking at your file all day, Jerry if that even is your real name."Jerry Gergich,It's not.Jerry Gergich,My real name is Gary.Andy Dwyer,"Well, Gary if that even is your real name Somebody stole my computer."Andy Dwyer,"Now, if you're a criminal, look at me, you have to tell me legally, or else it's considered entrapment."Jerry Gergich,"I'm sorry, Andy."Jerry Gergich,It wasn't me.Andy Dwyer,"Oh, man, really?"Andy Dwyer,No.Andy Dwyer,Okay.Andy Dwyer,"Okay, so we know it's not Jerry, unless he was lying to me."Andy Dwyer,I can never tell when people are lying to me.Andy Dwyer,Hopefully that doesn't come up in my police work.Leslie Knope,I think we should do more stuff like this.Leslie Knope,"You know, I think Pawnee needs an amazing arts program."Leslie Knope,Maybe you should just drop everything and coordinate it.April Ludgate,I'm not stupid.Leslie Knope,What is that supposed to mean?April Ludgate,It means that the only reason you brought me here is to distract me from the dog park.April Ludgate,You hate this show.Leslie Knope,I love this show.April Ludgate,What's your favorite part?Leslie Knope,The heavy handedness.April Ludgate,"You know what, I have to go talk to Councilman Jamm right now."Leslie Knope,Why are you talking to Councilman Jamm?April Ludgate,"Because I told him about the dog park idea, and he loves it."April Ludgate,He thinks it's a great idea.April Ludgate,"He's gonna support my motion at the city council meeting tomorrow, and he gave me a really cool dental mirror to check out my molars."Leslie Knope,"Our dispute aside, you should be careful with Jamm."Leslie Knope,"He's a snake, I'm telling you."April Ludgate,"Yeah, like I should trust you out of all people right now."Orin,Moo.Orin,Moo.Leslie Knope,"Quiet, weirdo."Leslie Knope,Aren't you supposed to be a sheep?Orin,No.Orin,You are.Leslie Knope,"Oh, shut up."Ben Wyatt,Tom would make a great profile for your show.Ben Wyatt,"I mean, this is a guy who's learned through an unbelievable series of bonehead business moves."Tom Haverford,"Not to mention in the last month alone three people have confused me for a shorter, Indian Ryan Gosling."Extra,"It's interesting, but I think I need to wait until the business has been around for a few months, make sure it's viable."Extra,"You're the guy who ran the congressional campaign  in Washington, right?"Ben Wyatt,Yeah.Tom Haverford,"What, are you gonna offer him a job?"Extra,Yes.Extra,"We're launching a new political chat show, and we need correspondents."Ben Wyatt,"Oh, well, thank you, but I'm a little shaky on live TV."Extra,That's okay.Extra,People want authenticity.Extra,Think about it?Tom Haverford,Didn't you hear him?Tom Haverford,He stinks on TV.Tom Haverford,He sweats.Tom Haverford,He stutters.Tom Haverford,"It's like The King's Speech, but the first part, before he's fixed."Extra,That was my favorite part of the movie.Tom Haverford,What is happening?Andy Dwyer,Chris Traeger.Chris Traeger,Yup.Chris Traeger,"Hi, Andy."Andy Dwyer,I know you did it.Chris Traeger,Did what?Andy Dwyer,Don't play stupid and handsome with me.Andy Dwyer,You stole my computer so that I could practice for my police exam.Andy Dwyer,You're as guilty as you are sexy.Chris Traeger,"Andy, another computer was reported stolen from the offices on the other side of the courtyard."Chris Traeger,I don't think this is part of your police training.Chris Traeger,I think City Hall was robbed.Andy Dwyer,I can't tell if you're lying to me.Andy Dwyer,Really?Chris Traeger,I think.Andy Dwyer,Like a real crime?Andy Dwyer,That's even better.Councilman Howser,"Next order of business: It's agenda item 280B, a motion to construct a dog park on municipal lot 48."Jeremy Jamm,"Ms. Ludgate, you have the floor."April Ludgate,"Thank you, Councilman Jamm."April Ludgate,Your help and general nonawfulness is much appreciated.April Ludgate,"Leslie, members of the Council, I believe that municipal lot 48 should be a dog park."Leslie Knope,Boo.Leslie Knope,Boo.Leslie Knope,"Well, it sounds like there's considerable opposition to this, so I'm sorry, Ms. Ludgate, you should go now."April Ludgate,Really?April Ludgate,I just heard one hag booing.Councilman Howser,"Ladies, please, let's keep this civil."Jeremy Jamm,"Councilman, Pawneeans, satisfied customers of Jamm Orthodontics, as we discuss what type of park to put on lot 48, I had a thought."Jeremy Jamm,How about no park?Jeremy Jamm,Who here thinks parks are stupid?Jeremy Jamm,Let the record show that everyone is raising their hands.Jeremy Jamm,"I happen to know for a fact that Pawnee's favorite fast food restaurant, Paunch Burger, needs a new location."Jeremy Jamm,"Now, seeing as how the future of lot 48 is open for debate, I move we sell it to Paunch Burger for a nice profit."Jeremy Jamm,You don't even have to be Asian to do math that simple.April Ludgate,You told me you wanted a dog park.Jeremy Jamm,"Uh, psych."April Ludgate,That's not fair.April Ludgate,You lied to me.Jeremy Jamm,You just got jammed.Leslie Knope,I hate when he says that.Leslie Knope,I told you that Jamm was a snake.April Ludgate,"Well, it takes a snake to know a snake."Leslie Knope,So now I'm a snake?April Ludgate,Yes.April Ludgate,"You deceived me for two straight days, and you eat mice."Leslie Knope,I don't eat mice.April Ludgate,"Yes, you do."April Ludgate,You're a mouse eater.April Ludgate,Mouse eater.April Ludgate,Mouse eater.Ron Swanson,Enough!Ron Swanson,You are friends and coworkers.Ron Swanson,"In this office, we treat each other with respect."Jerry Gergich,"Hey, April, how is that dog park coming?"April Ludgate,"Get out, Jerry."Ann Perkins,This is private!Jerry Gergich,"Sorry, guys."Ann Perkins,We are not leaving here until you two figure this out.Ann Perkins,"Ron, guard the door."Ron Swanson,"Yes, sir."Ann Perkins,No one leaves the Octagon.Ann Perkins,I dated an ultimate fighter.Ann Perkins,It was like a thing he said.Andy Dwyer,"What's the play here, officer?"Andy Dwyer,"You gonna set up a perimeter, maybe bug a few phones?"Andy Dwyer,"Ooh, I know."Andy Dwyer,"We could put out a dummy computer for them to steal, fill it with explosives first, Boom, take 'em all out."Extra,"Yeah, we're not doing any of that."Chris Traeger,"Andy, I love your enthusiasm, but we don't really have the kind of money to launch a massive investigation."Andy Dwyer,You're just gonna fill out this stupid report and that's it?Andy Dwyer,"As a future cop, you have to understand, I cannot let this guy go."Extra,"Look, man, this is what most police work is."Extra,Just writing stuff down.Extra,It's not superhero time.Extra,"If it sounds boring, maybe you ought to do something else."Chris Traeger,Maybe we should find the person who stole his positive attitude.Ben Wyatt,"Hey, man."Tom Haverford,"Hey, man."Tom Haverford,Get any more job offers since I last saw you?Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, but it was just a management position at Urban Outfitters."Ben Wyatt,I turned it down.Tom Haverford,"I don't know, man."Tom Haverford,Maybe I can't hack this.Tom Haverford,Maybe I should take a cue from you and stick with my boring day job.Ben Wyatt,"Well, my accounting job isn't boring."Tom Haverford,"If it was remotely interesting, there would be a show on A&E about it."Tom Haverford,They have a show about storage unit auctions.Ben Wyatt,Fair point.Ben Wyatt,"Look, if you're passionate about this, keep at it."Ben Wyatt,Things will turn around.Ben Wyatt,Also can you tell me what time that show about storage units is on?Tom Haverford,9:30Ann Perkins,"All right, I'm gonna have to force this."Ann Perkins,"Leslie, maybe you want to admit that you haven't been the greatest role model."April Ludgate,I don't care.April Ludgate,Orin's my role model.Ann Perkins,"April, maybe you want to admit that you've been a little selfish and inconsiderate."Leslie Knope,"Look, all I ever wanted was for you to show the enthusiasm you showed for your dog park, and, when you did, I blew it."Leslie Knope,And I'm sorry.April Ludgate,Fine.April Ludgate,I'm sorry that I outsmarted you at every turn.Ann Perkins,April.April Ludgate,"And I know I have a lot to learn from you, and I'm sorry that I disrespected your stupid dream."Ann Perkins,A lot of love in this room.Leslie Knope,"I'm very, very sorry."April Ludgate,Me too.Leslie Knope,I love you very much.April Ludgate,I love you too.April Ludgate,I don't want to do this in front of her.Leslie Knope,Okay.April Ludgate,"Okay, Ann, since you're such a genius, what do we do now?"Ann Perkins,"Neither of you want Jamm to win, nor do I, because I hate Paunch Burger, but, if there is one in my backyard, I will eat there, like, every night, and that is no good."Ann Perkins,"So I say we stop playing dirty with each other, and we start playing dirty with Jamm."April Ludgate,Yes.April Ludgate,We'll have triple sex with him.Leslie Knope,No.Leslie Knope,I have an idea.Leslie Knope,"It's very uncool, but it's not illegal, technically, but it is a dick move."April Ludgate,I love it.Andy Dwyer,"Hey, Captain."Andy Dwyer,Status update: My new suspect the dude who runs carpet emporium.Andy Dwyer,"The way I figure it is, criminals love to wrap things up in rugs."Andy Dwyer,"Plus, he yelled at me when I tried to unroll 'em all, so"Chris Traeger,"Andy, while I appreciate your dedication to finding this criminal, I think you might want to take into account what the policeman said."Andy Dwyer,"I mean, gosh, if I can't even investigate bad guys, why become a cop at all?"Chris Traeger,What are you doing?Andy Dwyer,"When I get bummed out, I take my shirt off because the bad feelings make me feel sweaty."Andy Dwyer,"You know what, maybe I should bail on being a cop."Chris Traeger,City Hall needs a new parttime security guard for the weekends.Chris Traeger,You want to do that?Chris Traeger,Look at it as a way to feel out whether you want to be a police officer.Chris Traeger,"But, keep in mind, if you take this job, you must keep your clothes on at all times, even if you get sad."Andy Dwyer,No deal.Andy Dwyer,"Okay, I'll do it."Chris Traeger,That a boy.Andy Dwyer,I'll do it.Andy Dwyer,I promise.Andy Dwyer,"And I get a gun, and I can point it in people's faces."Chris Traeger,Incorrect.Jeremy Jamm,Hey.Jeremy Jamm,What the hell is going on?Leslie Knope,"Oh, hello, Councilman."Leslie Knope,"The dogs are here because there's no dog park in your neighborhood, and the kids are here because there's no human park in your area."Leslie Knope,They all needed a place to play.Jeremy Jamm, My front lawn?April Ludgate," That's right, and they're gonna keep using it until there's an actual park nearby."Jeremy Jamm," Hey, hey, lady, get that thing off my gnome."Jeremy Jamm, He is dryhumping my garden gnome.Jeremy Jamm,Stupid beast.Leslie Knope,"Councilman Jamm, we just need a little bit more time to design our park."Leslie Knope," And, if you plow through and ignore us, this is gonna be your life."Jeremy Jamm, I'll call the police.Ann Perkins," Yeah, sic the police on a bunch of kids and puppies."Ann Perkins,That's a great photo op.Jeremy Jamm,Fine.Jeremy Jamm, Gentleman's agreement.Jeremy Jamm," In 90 days, we'll put our plans to a vote."Jeremy Jamm,Winner take all.Leslie Knope,Deal.Jeremy Jamm," Great, now call off the actual dogs."Jeremy Jamm, I want these kids off my lawn.Jeremy Jamm, I want that hula hoop off my 'Vette.Jeremy Jamm, Right now.Leslie Knope," Hey, Jamm."Leslie Knope, You just got knoped.Leslie Knope, And ludgated.Leslie Knope, And perkinsed.Jeremy Jamm,Ha-ha.Jeremy Jamm, Nice try.Jeremy Jamm, It didn't work.Jeremy Jamm, You just got jammed.Leslie Knope," Okay, so let's get to work."Ann Perkins," Wait, wait, wait, do you never just take a second to enjoy things?"Leslie Knope,"I just said, ""let's get to work."""Leslie Knope,How else do people enjoy things?Barney,"I know you changed your mind the last time we offered you a job, but we are just thrilled that you changed it again."Ben Wyatt, Thank you.Ben Wyatt, Me too.Barney, This is our best office.Barney," As you can see through the window, you have a great view of the billing department."Barney,"Hey, Sharon!"Extra, Shh.Barney, Sorry.Barney, She's fun.Barney," So, please, if there's anything we can do to make you happier in your new job, just let me know."Ben Wyatt," Oh, no, this is great, Barney."Ben Wyatt, Thank you.Ben Wyatt, But I have to quit again.Barney, WhatBarney, ohh! Is this a classic Ben joke?Ben Wyatt,No.Ben Wyatt, I'm really sorry.Ben Wyatt, But I just don't want to do this.Ben Wyatt, I need to move my life in another direction.Barney, This is disappointing.Barney, Again.Barney, Maybe someday we'll figure out the magic formula that gets you to work here.Ben Wyatt," Well, formulas are my formula for moolah."Barney," Ted, get in here! Ben's quitting again, but you gotta hear what he said."Ben Wyatt," Leslie's been saying for weeks I should do something I love, and she's right."Ben Wyatt, And I'll help Tom or maybe try to do that TV thing or maybe work for the Sweetums foundation.Ben Wyatt, I don't know.Ben Wyatt, Life is short.Ben Wyatt," Why be an accountant, you know? I mean, other than the stability and the health plan and the above-average pay."Ben Wyatt," Oh, God, this better work out.",   ,"

changed my mind."Leslie Knope,"I'm not being melodramatic when I say that people from Eagleton are snobby and evil, and they look down on Pawnee, and they would most likely exterminate everyone who isn't from Eagleton if they weren't so busy being obsessed with themselves."Leslie Knope,"God, that was close."Leslie Knope,"Sometimes when I rant about Eagleton, I forget to breathe, and I pass out."Leslie Knope,No.Leslie Knope,We cannot have someone from Eagleton design a park for Pawnee.Leslie Knope,We have had a blood feud that has lasted for 200 years.Ben Wyatt,"Well, we don't have a lot of time, and he is the first decent candidate."Ben Wyatt,So let's at least go meet the guy.Leslie Knope,"Yeah, that's a good idea."Leslie Knope,Then we can reject him face to face.Leslie

quiet.Wreston St. James,"As you can see, we like to keep things quite immaculate."Wreston St. James,I remember when Pawnee had that massive sewage overflow in Circle Park whatever happened with that?Leslie Knope,We totally fixed it.Ben Wyatt,"Well, except for the smell."Ben Wyatt,The scientists think it's going to linger for another 40 years.Leslie Knope,Can we just cut to the chase here?Leslie Knope,Why would a fancy Eagleton architect like you want to design a tiny Pawnee park?Wreston St. James,"Well, I heard your plea on the radio, and you were so passionate about the project."Wreston St. James,It doesn't matter if it's a giant park like this or a little tiny pocket park.Wreston St. James,It's about the people.Wreston St. James,We're here to serve them.Extra,"Hey, Mr. St. James!"Wreston St. James,"Oh, our balloon artisan is out of balloons."Wreston St. James,Excuse me.Ben Wyatt,I have chills.Ben Wyatt,Look at my arm.Leslie Knope,Why are you so charmed by him?Leslie Knope,You're like a Southern belle when Rhett Butler comes around.Ben Wyatt,Yes.Ben Wyatt,Rhett Butler.Ben Wyatt,That's who he reminds me of.Ben Wyatt,Or Bono!Leslie Knope,What?Leslie Knope,No one from Eagleton has ever wanted to help anyone from Pawnee for any reason.Leslie Knope,"In 1988, we were hit by a tornado."Leslie Knope,"We asked Eagleton for help, and they claimed they weren't home."Leslie Knope,An entire town claimed they weren't home.Leslie Knope,I don't trust that guy for a second.Ben Wyatt,"Leslie, look what Wreston commissioned from the balloon artisan."Ben Wyatt,It's us.Tom Haverford,"Great work, team."Tom Haverford,"Donna, you and your work are ravishing, as usual."Tom Haverford,"Ann, great organizational skills."Ann Perkins,Wow.Ann Perkins,Genuine praise.Tom Haverford,It's a tip I picked up from Lee Iacocca's autobiography.Tom Haverford,A small connection between you and your workers helps build loyalty.Tom

drop a beat!"Tom Haverford,RentASwag is gonna be the opposite of Entertainment720.Tom Haverford,This is my last chance.Tom Haverford,"If this goes down in flames, I will have nothing except my looks."Tom Haverford,I could always pimp myself out to hot older ladies.Tom Haverford,I need to remember that.Leslie Knope,"May, 1817."Leslie Knope,"A scrappy group of frontiersmen and women arrive at a hardscrabble chunk of land and call it Pawnee, Indiana."Wreston St. James,We owe them a debt of gratitude.Leslie Knope,Mm.Leslie Knope,"June, 1817, the richest among them take all of their money from the bank and then flee up the hill like cowards to form Eagleton."Leslie Knope,Recognize any of your ancestors among the meanies?Wreston St. James,"Actually, like most people from the area, I have ancestors on both sides."Wreston St. James,That's why I think this rivalry is just a little silly  and selfdefeating.Ben Wyatt,"Yeah, you may not know this, but Leslie was actually born in Eagleton."Leslie Knope,Do not blame me for the sins of my mother.Wreston St. James,"Look Ms. Knope, I'm really trying here, but I just don't know if our working together is such a great idea."Leslie Knope,Oh running away so soon.Leslie Knope,Typical.Leslie Knope,"You know, say what you want about Pawneeans, but we never give up."Ben Wyatt,"We have a mural called ""The Many Surrenders of Pawnee."""Leslie Knope,"Oh, look who's paying attention to me now!"Ben Wyatt,Okay.Ben Wyatt,Can I speak to you privately for a minute?Andy Dwyer,The name is special agent Bert Macklin.Andy Dwyer,"Tell me who you are, who you work for, and don't bother trying to lie to me, because I'm amazing."April Ludgate,"My name is Judy Hitler, and I am the spoiled only daughter of Adolf."April Ludgate,"And I'm going to tell my Daddy you were mean to me, Bert Macklin."April Ludgate,He's not going to like it very much.April Ludgate,So untie me!Andy Dwyer,"Nice try, Miss Hitler, but you have something that I want."Andy Dwyer,Where's the necklace with all of Germany's war secrets?April Ludgate,I don't know what you are talking about.Andy Dwyer,I think you do!April Ludgate,I don't!Andy Dwyer,"Now, you give me that war ending necklace, or I will resort to torture."April Ludgate,Fine.April Ludgate,"I will show you where it is, damn it."April Ludgate,"You're too good, Macklin."Andy Dwyer,"Don't you do it, Hitler."Andy Dwyer,Don't you dare fall in love with me.Andy Dwyer,"Oh, Hitler, you sexy bastard."Andy Dwyer,No!April Ludgate,Yes!Andy Dwyer,MmMm!Andy Dwyer,Aah!Chris Traeger,I am just filled to the brim with questions.Chris Traeger,Why are you using this wood?Chris Traeger,Is it more pliable?Chris Traeger,What are these metal latches?Chris Traeger,Are they copper or brass?Chris Traeger,Is one better?Chris Traeger,"And if so, why?"Ron Swanson,"If I tell you, then you won't have learned anything."Chris Traeger,Another in a long line of lessons from the great Ron Swanson.Chris Traeger,"My therapist, Dr."Chris Traeger,"Richard Nygard, suggested that I try some non exercise based hobbies."Chris Traeger,So I've been studying woodworking with Ron.Chris Traeger,I made this.Chris Traeger,"Before I started, it was bigger."Ron Swanson,Here.Ron Swanson,I have designed something very important.Ron Swanson,Why don't you start work on that right away?Chris Traeger,"Yes, sir!"Ron Swanson,It's a flight of stairs that leads to nowhere.Ben Wyatt,Were you listening to him when he was talking about serving the public and making our communities better?Ben Wyatt,"You know who he sounds like, right?"Leslie Knope,Yes.Leslie Knope,Idi Amin.Leslie Knope,Or Lord Voldemort.Ben Wyatt,No.Ben Wyatt,You.Ben Wyatt,"Now, you've been very rude to him, and you need to apologize."Leslie Knope,Ha ha ha.Leslie Knope,"You are a laugh riot, Ben."Leslie Knope,I am never going to apologize to someone from Eagleton.Ben Wyatt,All right.Ben Wyatt,So you can kiss your park and four years of work goodbye.Ben Wyatt,Up to you.Ben Wyatt,Come on.Ben Wyatt,You can do it.Leslie Knope,I don't want to.Ben Wyatt,You can You can do it.Ben Wyatt,"Mr. St. James, this has been a strange day."Ben Wyatt,But we wouldn't want to leave you with the wrong impression of Pawnee.Andy Dwyer,Have you guys seen Hitler?Ben Wyatt,"Anyway, we would love to have you design the park, and in the spirit of reconciliation, Leslie would like to apologize."Leslie Knope,"I may have allowed my prejudices, my totally legitimate prejudices against Eagleton affect my feelings towards your involvement in this project, and so therefore, I would like to say that I'm I'm I'm Leslie Knope."Leslie Knope,No.Leslie Knope,That's not what I want to say.Leslie Knope,Okay.Leslie Knope,My mouth is kinda dry.Leslie Knope,My mouth is dry.Leslie Knope,This is Canada Dry.Leslie Knope,Drink Canada Dry if your mouth is dry.Leslie Knope,That's nothing.Leslie Knope,What I want to say is I'm s I'm sor I'm sorLeslie Knope,He's a human being.Leslie Knope,You're a human being.Leslie Knope,You can just just say I'm sorBen Wyatt,"Oh, my God."Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.Leslie Knope,I'm sorry.Leslie Knope,"I'm sorry that I I'm sorry, very sorry, that I was rude."Leslie Knope,It's too soon.Wreston St. James,"You know what, as a gesture of good will, I'd like to waive my fee."Wreston St. James,I'll design the park pro bono.Leslie Knope,Thank you.Leslie Knope,That's very nice of you.Wreston St. James,I've been working up a little model of the design.Wreston St. James,"Why don't I bring it over, and we can all go through it together."Ben Wyatt,Great.Ben Wyatt,And then you can come to our wedding.Leslie Knope,Huh?Wreston St. James,What?Ben Wyatt,"It's in May, and we haven't planned it yet, but save the date."April Ludgate,I was never here.Andy Dwyer,Ah!April Ludgate,Aah!Tom Haverford,"Well done, team."Tom Haverford,What do you think of the place?Ann Perkins,Do you really like this yellow paint?Ann Perkins,"I mean, I know it was on sale, but it looks a lot like dried phlegm."Donna Meagle,"For real, Tom."Donna Meagle,This place is sad.Donna Meagle,I think one of the mannequins tried to commit suicide.Chris Traeger,"I think what's important is we all had a goal, and we achieved it."Ann Perkins,So you like the place?Chris Traeger,"Oh, no, it's quite terrible."Tom Haverford,This is the best I can do for now.Tom Haverford,And I'm $46 under budget.Tom Haverford,Now I have a small treat for you guys for all your hard work.Tom Haverford,Pizza party!Jerry Gergich,One small pizza for all of us.Jerry Gergich,With no toppings.Tom Haverford,"Cheese is a topping, Jerry."Tom Haverford,"And why are these lights blaring, by the way?"Tom Haverford,Does someone here own stock in the electric company?Ron Swanson,"If there were more food and fewer people, this would be a perfect party."Andy Dwyer,"You can't run, Hitler."Andy Dwyer,82nd airborne is everywhere!Andy Dwyer,History channel.Andy Dwyer,Ho ho ho!Andy Dwyer,What is this?Andy

this?,I gue Why not?,The gala ends at 11:00.,"At 11:01, we get married.","Okay But, wait, my mom isn't here.",And your parents aren't here.,Good.,"Yeah, that makes it better.",But we reserved a space for May 16th.,And we just ordered  We did?,"You did, actually.",It's under your name.,"Leslie, we can get married May 16th, or June 1st, or July 57th.","But doesn't it feel right, today?","Yeah, it does.","Every time you say it, it just feels more right.","Oh, my God, we're getting married tonight.",This is really great.,Yeah.,"You're either in or your out, buddy.","Iit was my idea, I'm totally in.","Wait, no.",We can't this is our wedding day.,"This is very bad luck, turn around.",We can't look at each other!,"Well, you are aware that we've seen each other several times today.",We have two hours to do this.,"I want you to get everyone together, and meet me at Ann's house in ten minutes.",Okay.,"Oh, wait, before we get married, there is something we need to discuss.","I mean, we've never talked about it, but I really want you to take my last name.",Oh!,Oh.,Okay.,Really?,"Yeah, it's just really important to me, symbolically, that Leslie Knope disappears and becomes Leslie Wyatt.",Or Councilwoman Mrs.,Ben Wyatt.,That's fine too.,It's a deal breaker.,"Wait, are you messing with me?","Sorry, I had to give it a shot.","Ben, now go, run!","Okay, okay.",Wait.,Where do I go?,Run!,The falcon is entering!,The turtledove acknowledges!,"Hey, where are you?",I'mI'm here.,"Okay, let's go over the duties right now.","Ann, you're in charge of the dress and the hair and the makeup.","And I was thinking, like, the sensuality of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with the animal magnetism of Lesley Stahl.",Piece of cake.,"Oh, we have to get the wedding cake.",I'll do that too.,I'm perfectly calm.,"I feel like every crazy thing Leslie's ever had me do has been, like a drill, and today is the real thing.","I'm ready, because I had the greatest teacher in the world.",Leslie.,Who is crazy.,"Also, we need rings and marriage licenses.","Oh, let me be on rings.",I love what they symbolize.,Great.,And I can do the license.,I got a guy that works at City Hall.,That guy's my wife.,"Um, you also work there.","Oh, yeah.","Ron, I'm gonna need you to walk me down the aisle.","It would be an honor, and the first time I won't regret walking down the aisle.","Oh, uh, yikes.",We need an officiant.,I got this.,"You can become an ordained minister online in, like, five minutes.",Do you want more like a Steve Harvey vibe or straightup Seacrest?,Nuh!,Never mind.,I'll combine 'em Stevecrest.,"Okay, and, um, Jerry and Donna, I need you guys to just make sure that the gala runs smoothly.",Let's say that we're all gonna meet back here in an hour.,I love all of you.,"One, two, three, break!",Excuse me.,We're looking for a couple wedding rings.,You're gonna wanna look through the jewelry and nails tray.,There is some beautiful jewelry in here.,But be careful.,There's also nails.,Oh!,"Oh, these aren't bad.",Those are real nice.,"And they were nipple rings, at one point.",How do you know that?,Mm.,They were yours.,They were his.,Let's go.,"Hey, it's pretty crazy, I'm gonna be a cop tomorrow.",I guess I better commit as many crimes as possible tonight.,Get it out of my system.,"Ooh, found the marriage licenses.",And I am going to take all of them.,"I don't want anyone else in this town to get married, because it makes it less special for us.","Good call, babe.",Let's roll.,Okay.,I'm good!,It's not finished.,Why didn't the seamstress finish it?,"If you're not gonna finish something three months early, then don't accept the job.",There's got to be something we can do.,This wedding is meant to be.,We're gonna figure it out.,Now how did Cinderella finish her dress so fast?,Squirrels and birds.,Mm.,That's not very helpful.,No.,"Hey, we got it!",We got it.,Marriage licensedone.,"Wait a minute, hold on.",It needs to be signed by somebody at the City Clerk's Office.,I'll just forge it.,I forge government documents all the time.,That's true.,Boom.,No.,Hey.,Hey.,So we didn't find any rings.,"Yeah, we're having a few roadblocks here.",Kind of feels like this thing is falling apart.,Don't panic.,I swear there's some rings in this old box of stuff my mom gave me.,Still here at April and Andy's house.,Want to come help me look?,"Okay, Ann, dress duty.","April and Andy, license duty.",No time for verbs.,"I know you're in a rush, Leslie.","I should point out that you said ""duty"" twice.",Okay.,"Aw, shucks, business is aboomin'.",Indiana celebrity lookalikes.,"I mean, this is a brilliant idea, Donna.",All my favorites are here.,"We got Orville Redenbacher, La Toya Jackson, Axl Rose, David Letterman.","Look, don't tell anyone, but I booked a special surprise.",There's a Li'l Sebastian lookalike on the way what?,What?,"Oh, my G Oh!",Oh.,Did you just pee your pants?,Just a dab.,I better go clean up.,"You nasty, Jerry.",Third time this week.,"Oh, what the hell!",What's wrong?,"""Your Minister Certification will be emailed to you in 24 hours.",""" Uhh!",But this is America.,I want it now!,"Sorry, Tom, that's what happens.",I had all these great bits written for the wedding too.,I was gonna beatbox.,There's a dance breakdown.,"I'm talking, like, six guaranteed applause breaks.","Uh, you know, I am actually ordained.",I could do the wedding.,That's the worst idea I've ever heard.,"Yeah, you're right, okay.",Wait!,"What if you do the ceremony, but you don't have any stupid ideas of your own, and you just say the stuff that I came up with?",Anything to help Leslie.,Perfect.,Now shut up and start memorizing.,We open with Will Smith's monologue from the modern cinematic classic Hitch.,Turtledove?,Falcon?,Turtledove.,Falcon?,Turtledove.,There's your butt.,Hey.,Did you find the rings?,"No rings, just a tennis bracelet and a necklace that says ""Wine Chick.",""" No rings, no license, no dress.","This idea felt so right, but maybe it's just too crazy.",Maybe it wasn't meant to be.,"Hey, it's snowing.",It's him.,What?,Who?,I can't see.,"I don't understand, this is impossible.",Wh Whoa.,Li'l Sebastian?,"No, no, sorry.","Actually, this is Bucky.","He's a, uh, licensed Li'l Sebastian impersonator.","We're headed to the gala, so folks can pose for pictures with him.",if you're interested.,"Quiet, you.","This is Li'l Sebastian, and this is a sign.",We're gonna do this.,We are gonna pull this wedding off.,"Come on, Bucky.",Li'l Sebastian.,"Yes, ma'am.","Oh my God, we're running out of time.","Ann, please, tell me that you have sewn a new dress from scratch.","Or several dresses, 'cause I would love some options.","I have an idea, and it might be insane, but I've been watching a lot Project Runway recently In the past eight years.","Okay, great, so I trust you, and make it work.",No time to do the Tim Gunn voice.,"Wait, what am I talking about?",There's always time.,"Designers, make it work.","Ann, you have less than an hour.","Miss Beavers, this is official police business.",I hope we didn't wake you up.,It's after 10:00.,I've been asleep for four hours.,What do you want?,We need you to sign this.,It's a marriage license.,Ethel?,Is it robbers?,"No, go back to bed.","Aww, is that your husband?",I'm not married.,I was on a date tonight.,"It went well, he's sleeping over.",Cool.,It'd really mean a lot if you sign it.,It's for Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt.,I think you know them?,"They dragged me out in the freezing cold once, so they could tell each other ""I love you.",""" It was annoying.","Oh, thank you so much!",You have got an amazing house and a really cool nightgown and seem to be super good at dating.,"Yeah, so can we adopt you as our grandma?",Fine.,Cool!,"We love you, Grandma!","I guess we could go to a pharmacy, but I really don't want to use like a cheap plastic ring.","I hate to say this, but Ann Perkins has terrible taste in rings.",Whatwhat is this?,It's a toe ring with a brown gemstone?,Is this a ruby that's gone bad?,I am out of ideas.,Jewelry store.,"No, that's closed, that's why we're doing this.",Perhaps I can be of service.,How?,How much do you think Ann would miss this sconce?,"Oh, I don't know.",It's part of her house.,"Well, okay.","""When I heard Ben was getting married, I was like, 'to Leslie or to Game of Thrones'?",""" Ugh, horrible delivery.","""You ever heard Leslie talk about Ben's butt?","""I'm all like, 'damn, girl, you mad sweet on that back meat.","'"" You're murdering my beautiful words!",Do you even want to kill at this wedding?,I just want Leslie and Ben to have a nice night.,I'm sorry.,"I  No, no.",It's my fault for believing in you.,"Well, look, um, to be official, I just have to do the vows and the pronouncement.","So why don't you handle the speech, and then I'll just come in at the end?","Well, I'm not crazy about the part where you do something.","But, I do like the idea me doing something.",Let's give it a shot.,"Hello, everyone.",Got some bad news.,The gala ends at 11:00.,"The good news is, at 11:01, we'll be holding a special wedding ceremony.",Everyone is invited to stay.,All the drinks and the food will be on us.,"Hey, everything going okay?",Everything would be peachy if it weren't for that dumbass with a megaphone.,No one wants a park here.,Parks are stupid.,"Hey, butterteeth, what's up?",I can fix those chompers for you.,Just come to Jamm Orthodontics.,"Councilman Jamm, what are you doing here?",What are you doing here?,Parks are stupid.,"Hey, enough.",You better give me back that megaphone.,That belongs to my aunt.,Why don't I call you a cab?,Mm.,"No, this isn't over, Knope.",It is over.,I won fair and square.,"And, in a half an hour, I am getting married over there to the most perfect man in the world.",And all my dreams are coming true.,"Knope rules, Jamm sucks.","Knope rules, Jamm sucks.","Knope rules, Ja Councilman Howser.",Leslie.,Jeremy.,You better make sure my aunt gets her megaphone back.,"Okay, did I did I do it right?",How's it look?,Terrible.,And perfect.,I promised myself I was not going to cry tonight.,And I have already broken that promise five times.,But I will not break it a sixth.,"Go ahead and let it out, buddy.",It's okay.,I have something for you.,All right.,It is the letter from the statehouse Telling us that we have been assigned to Pawnee.,"Dated may 1st, 2010.",No way.,We were supposed to be here eight weeks.,"I'm so happy that those eight weeks turned into three years, and that you met Leslie, and that we both found a home.","Damn it, you're transferring your crying thing over to me.","It's okay, buddy, let it out.","I gathered up all the meaningful bills, pictures, documents, and memos from your career.",What do you think?,Is it okay?,It is the most beautiful object I have ever seen.,It is like the Ann Perkins of dresses.,Yay.,It is amazing.,All set.,"Leslie, wow!",You look amazing.,Right?,"Oh, my God!",What?,I'm not supposed to see you before the wedding.,"No, that's the groom  I ruined it!","Andy, that's the groom.","Well, I saw him too.","I'm just gonna cover my eyes, just to be safe.","Okay, so we're ready out there.",For your wedding or whatever.,"Oh, my God, the license, the rings, the officiant, everything?","Yes, it all came together.",Let's go.,"Boo, boo.","Boo, Leslie Knope, boo.","Here comes the boo   all dressed in boo   boo, Leslie Knope   boo, boooooooo  Boo!","Dude, what are you doing?",I'm being awesome.,"Boo, boo, Leslie, boo.","My friend, I don't think you understand what a bad idea this is.",I don't think you understand that I would have got a cut of that new Paunch Burger if she hadn't screwed everything up.,"So sorry, guys!","This wedding is canceled, 'cause the bride is a bhole.",Hey!,Check this out.,Stink bomb!,Who knows what that does?,Oh!,Stink bomb?,Are you joking?,"Oh, my God!",Where did you even get a stink bomb?,"Amazon, baby, that's how.","You are looking at a prime customer, everybody.",Two days free shipping for this guy.,"Let's get this party started with another one, gang!",No!,It's terrible!,"Jerry, you do the wedding.",Who cares?,"Come on, man, just go home.",And who's gonna make me?,It's your wedding day.,I'll handle this.,Here comes the bride.,"Time to go, sir.",No.,"Hey, get off me, what the hell, man?",Don't you touch me.,Oh.,I'll give you that one.,But if you do it again  If I do what again?,"What, kick your ass?",Is that what you like?,You want me to just pound Ooh!,Ow.,"Yay, best wedding ever.",Ow.,You broke my tooth.,"Well, good thing you're an orthodontist.","Yeah, it is a good thing.",You see my house?,Five bathrooms.,Great.,"I'm sorry, Leslie.",For what?,"I've never presented a bride on her wedding day, so I'm not 100% sure of the duties involved, but I don't think you're supposed to punch a man in the mouth during the service.","I think that's exactly what you're supposed to do, if that mouth is attached to a drunk jerkface.","Well, please, don't worry about me.",Just go and get married.,No.,Leslie.,Ron.,Listen to me very carefully.,"I lost my father when I was ten, I don't have any brothers, and Ken Burns never wrote me back.",So I am not getting married without you there to walk me down the aisle.,End of discussion.,"Better get used to this, honey.",Gonna be a lot of late nights for me here.,Graveyard shift.,You coming to bring me coffee while I interrogate murderers.,"You've had all night to get something out of him, Dwyer,  we gotta let him go.","Come on, Captain.",I'm this close to getting a confession.,"You're never gonna break him, Dwyer.",He's a psychopath.,"He chopped off both of his arms, so he wouldn't leave any fingerprints.","Oh, he did?","Well, how did he murder the person?",I don't know.,"Hey, Chief Fugleberg.","It's me, Andy Dwyer, prereporting for duty.","Listen, about my new partner.",Is it a dog?," Oh, has Chris Traeger not told you?", Told me what?," Hey, Ron, we posted bail.", - You're free to go.," - Wait a minute, what? He punched me in the teeth.", This is an outrage., I think we have a pretty clear picture of what went down.," Sleep it off in the cell, Councilman."," Leslie, I'm so sorry.", I think we missed it.," The gala's over, they're taking it all down."," Yeah, it's okay."," I mean, I guess it just wasn't meant to be, after all.", We'll get married in May like we planned.," You know what? I have some champagne, back at the office."," Let's go back there, have a drink, toast to Pawnee Commons.", Fun., That's a good idea.," It'll be good, 'cause I actually have some work I need to get started on.", I got five bathrooms., I love the first floor of City Hall at night., When all the fluorescents are half-off., Just makes the informational fliers look so beautiful., I've never willingly been here later than 5:04 p.,m.," Before we go inside, I'd like to say something.", You are a wonderful person., Your friendship means a lot to me., And you look very beautiful.," Okay, weirdo.", Let's go.," Hoo, boy."," All set? Mmhmm Jerry, everything I wrote is wrong."," There's, like, 20 minutes of Hitch quotes before I even say Leslie's name."," What do I do? You know what, Tom? Just speak from the heart, okay? You'll do great.", We are gathered here tonight to join Leslie Knope and Benjamin Wyatt in marriage., It's been a long and winding road for these two lovebirds., And they're so impatient to begin their lives together they've moved their wedding date up three months.," So I say, let's keep it short and sweet."," Yes, just do it already."," I assume, and hope, you prepared your own vows? Ben, you want to say some stuff about Leslie? In my time working for the state government, my job sent me to 46 cities in 11 years."," I lived in villages with eight people, rural farming communities, college towns.", I was sent to every corner of Indiana., And then I came here.," And I realized that, this whole time, I was just wandering around, everywhere, just looking for you."," Leslie, do you want to say some stuff about Ben now? Okay, well, the first draft of my vows, which I wrote the day after we got engaged, clocked in at around 70 pages.", But I don't have them with me today., Although maybe there's a copy of them in my office., No.," That's fine, that's fine.", - I think we can just keep going., - Okay.," Here's what I'll say, then."," The things that you have done for me, to help me, support me, surprise me, to make me happy, go above and beyond what any person deserves.", You're all I need., I love you and I like you., I love you and I like you.," And now, with the power vested in me by the state of Indiana, I now pronounce you husband and wife."," You may now kiss the-- well, oops, okay.", - Yay! - Whoo! Lagavulin all around? Don't bother answering., I am already pouring., - You don't have to drink yours., - Thank you.," Just this once, I thought I nailed something."," Well, I'm still proud of you.", You worked hard and you got really close., Close only counts in horse grenades., - What? - It's a saying.," Because if you're playing horseshoes, and then you throw a grenade at a horse, it doesn't have to be that close, and you can still blow the horse's legs off.", It's from the movie Seabiscuit., How's it going in here? Good., I was just telling Andy that I'm proud of him., Oh.," And I was just explaining to April that I'm a failure, and she should leave me for Orin."," Andy, this is a very important moment for you.", How we deal with tragedy defines who we are., I used to be terrible at it., Beyond terrible., You are not going to let this deflate you.," You are going to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and we will figure out what the next step is.", Chris can be very Paternal., I look around this room.," If it weren't for Leslie Knope, none of us would be here."," So, Leslie, this song, which is for Li'l Sebastian, is for you.","  Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing   you trade your legs for angel's wings   and once we've all said good-bye   you take a running leap, and you learn to fly   Bye-bye, Li'l Sebastian   miss you in the saddest fashion  There were a lot of signs that Ben and I should get married tonight."," But, truth be told, we just really wanted to get married."," When you're in love, everything seems like a sign.", I love my husband., I love my job., And I love my friends., Even though they really can't handle their booze.," Hey, we should just go, right? Careful.",  Spread your wings and fly   spread your wings and fly  It's not rocket science.," I removed the sconce Fired up my grandfather's torch, heated up the pieces in a cast-iron bucket.", Liquefied the metal., Pour it into a mold., Obviously keep it over a low flame to achieve a nice temper., Cooled it in antifreeze., And just forged and shaped the rings.," Any moron with a crucible, an acetylene torch, and a cast-iron waffle maker could have done the same.", Whole thing only took me about 20 minutes., People who buy things are suckers.,   ,"

went and visited Honolulu City Hall.,Shut up.,You know.,"Oh, my God, what was it like?",It was amazing.,"Well, it looked amazing, but it was closed.","Oh, my God, bummer.","Okay, I have presents!","Um Chris, we got you an Acai tree because the Acai berry is a superfood.",And a super gift.,"Donna, we got you some coffee, because you said, and I quote, ""I like my coffee like I like my men.","Dark, rich, and fullbodied.",""" Yes, indeed.","Ann, we got you some very rare Hawaiian fertility tea, guaranteed to help you have a baby.",That's so nice.,Where'd you find that?,"Well, the busboy at our restaurant told us about a guy who we met in a parking lot, and then he had a backpack full of this stuff, and I'm just realizing now that it's not tea.",And I'm gonna throw it away.,"Ron, this is the Hawaiian god of anger.",It reminded us of you when you're at work.,A handsome gentleman.,We did not forget Jerry.,"Right, right.","We got Jerry some earbuds, and a bag of peanuts, and the Skymall catalog.",Same thing you got me from your trip to Washington!,"Tom, we got you an autographed portrait of your personal hero.",No way!,Scott Caan from Hawaii five0!,"April, as requested, we threw that box you gave us into that volcano.",Thank you.,"Andy, as you requested, got you a threepack of white Tshirts from Target.",Thank you.,All mine are dirty.,"Thank you, Hawaii.",Thank you so much.,It's great to be here at the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.,"There's so many wonderful, talented journalists here.",Also here are some reporters from the Pawnee Sun.,"Oh, hey, hey.",I love the Pawnee Sun.,Some people say that it's a useless tabloid.,But I don't think it's useless.,I think it's great for housebreaking puppies.,I am prepping for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch.,It's an annual affair where the media and the government roast each other.,My number one target the Pawnee Sun.,they rake me over the coals.,"Today, I take those burning coals, I shove them back down their throats, and I watch their melting flesh drip off their worthless faces!",It's all in good fun.,"Okay, I need more jokes, people.","Ben is having his first day at work, so he cannot help me.",So I need you guys to pick up the slack.,I have a joke for you.,Okay.,The government in this town is excellent and uses your tax dollars efficiently.,"That's not really a joke, Ron.",I disagree.,I find it hilarious.,Ann Perkins!,"Hey, Chris!",Got to run to a meeting.,With Ron.,Great idea!,I'll run to my next meeting.,"Sorry, the door was open.",I wish this office had only walls.,"Chris broke up with his girlfriend a week ago, and I have decided to ask him to be the father of my baby.",Except I cannot work up the nerve to do it.,Turns out they don't make greeting cards for asking your exboyfriend if he will artificially inseminate you.,"Actually, Ron, II could use your advice on how to be blunt and honest.","I want my friend to do something for me, and I don't know how to ask him.",What do you want him to do?,Plant ficuses.,In my front yard.,Grossest metaphor ever.,I've seen your house.,You'd have more success if he planted ficuses in your backyard.,"No, I don't think so.","Anyway, what if he thinks I'm asking too much of him, and I ask him to plant the ficuses, and he doesn't want to, and he gets weird about it, and it ruins our friendship?",Then plant the damn ficuses yourself.,I wish that were possible.,We are so excited to have you working with us here at the allnew Sweetums Foundation.,This is your office.,This is incredible.,And look at that art.,"Ah, yes.",My late husband.,He was so decrepit.,I really like helping people.,Running the new Sweetums Foundation charity allows me to do that and work in an office with more mahogany wood than currently remains in the Amazon rain forest.,"So, winwin.",Except for the rain forest.,I need you to select your first charity by tomorrow.,Sweetums' public image is currently at an alltime low.,"Yeah, there's even a rumor going around that the chocolate is made of rat parts.",Well You know what they say about rumors.,Yeah.,They're mostly true.,Including the rat thing?,Yeah.,What are you gonna do?,It's where all the flavor comes from.,"Oh, would you look at that.",There is a smudge on my tail.,Oh!,All better.,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, where politicians and the media make fun of each other.","But, if you ask me, we should be making fun of the food.","""I am not the cook.",""" Oh, well, well, well.",If it isn't Kim Terlando from the Pawnee Sun.,Do you happen to have a can opener?,'Cause I'm about to open this on you.,"Did you make that can of ""whoop ass"" for this exact moment?","Yeah, I came prepared.",I'd expect nothing less.,Good luck with your speech.,"Uh, my speech doesn't need your luck.",It needs a Surgeon General's warning because it's so harmful to your health.,"Oh, look, it has one.",That's how ready I am.,I'm glad you're so confident.,Nice to see you.,It was nice to see you too.,"Chris, can I talk to you for a second?",Absolutely.,I cannot wait.,One second.,"Excuse me, sir.",I think I accidentally got the meat option.,"Yeah, and I got the veggie option.","Shauna MalwaeTweep, my exgirlfriend.",It seems like you and I have a classic mix 'em up.,"Yeah, fancy meeting you here.","This isn't awkward for you, is it?","Chris, it's okay.",You wanna switch?,I'm starving.,Definitely.,Whoa!,Check out the new digs.,This place is insane.,"Thanks for coming, guys.","I'm super swamped, and I need your help.",Pass.,You came down here to pass on helping me?,"Yeah, I wanted to see what your face looked like when I said no.",It was totally worth it.,"Andy, are you okay?","Oh, I'm fine.",It's just that life is pointless and nothing matters and I'm always tired.,"Also, I can't sleep, I'm overeating, none of my old hobbies interest me.","Ever since Andy failed the police academy exam, his selfesteem has hit rock bottom.",He's always sad and sweaty.,He's usually happy and sweaty.,"I have to pick our first charity by tomorrow, and there's a million applications.",Can you guys help me sort 'em out?,You know what?,This sounds like fun.,"Babe, come on.",Let's help him.,It'll be fun.,"Well, it sounds like you guys got it covered.",I'm gonna head out.,Actually have my own charity to attend to.,Tommy's tummy foundation.,"Well, they bring me fancy lunches here.","If you stay, you can have some.",What?,"Crab, caviar?","On behalf of Tommy's tummy foundation, I'm happy to accept this generous donation.",Please welcome Kim Terlando.,"Thank you, Martin.",It's nice to be here among all of these excellent journalists.,And also the people that work with me over at the Pawnee Sun.,Damn it.,That was my opener.,"Now I love working at the Sun, okay?","And I know you all think it's just a useless tabloid, but it's not.",It is great.,For housebreaking puppies.,Those are my jokes.,She's stealing my jokes.,Some people say that the Sun has a problem with the truth.,"There's no problem, we just ignore it.","Jerry, stop laughing.",Those are stolen jokes!,Totally dead.,What am I gonna do?,Oh!,"I just opened up a can of ""whoop ass"" on myself!",I remember the very first Correspondents' Lunch.,I rode here in a horse and buggy.,"No, no, no, that wasn't a joke.",I actually did.,That also was not a joke.,"Ron, Kim told all my jokes, all of them.",She must have gotten a copy of my speech.,Did anybody lose their copy?,Nope.,Right here.,Mine is right here.,"Oh, jeez.",Go stand in the corner and think about what you've done.,And no dessert!,"I need new material, and it needs to be great, and it needs to knock people on their butts, and it needs to transcend the genre of roast comedy.","Perkins, go.","Oh, wow.","Um, okay, so Councilman Milton is old, right?",And he's wearing a green tie.,"So, like, maybe there's something there, where, like, he went to school with his highschool buddies that were dinosaurs.",And his tie is green.,They're green.,"Oh, Ann, you're too beautiful to be funny.",It's not your fault.,You've never had to compensate for anything.,The rest of you ugly nerds need to give me some jokes stat.,Ben?,Ben?,"Yeah, Andy.",I think I might have found something that's actually pretty cool.,"Okay, well, just put it aside, and I'll read it later.",No.,"Andy found it, and he's gonna tell you about it right now.","Go, babe.","Uh, it's the Redwood Music Program.",It's an afterschool music class for atrisk kids.,It'll keep them off the street.,Whoa.,"And the streets, as you know, are dangerous.",ExampleI fell in a sewer grate once.,I was there all day.,"In conclusion, we cannot let our children live in the sewer any longer.","Redwood Music Program go, your honor, amen.",That's a great idea.,Anyone else come across anything good?,Tom?,"Um, yeah.",I got a good one.,It's called the Clean Sheet Foundation.,That's my pick.,They provide legal assistance to the KKK.,This is your pick?,Yeah.,Can you pass the bonbons?,Perd Hapley is here today.,"Or, as Perd would say, ""My name is Perd Hapley, and the person I see here today is me.",""" Everyone seems to be laughing now.",Do you see what is happening with Chris and Shauna?,They are flirting like crazy.,It's disgusting.,They're in public.,That's called a conversation.,"Ron, there are no ficuses, okay?",I wanted to ask Chris to be the father of my baby.,Good God.,And the metaphor you chose was planting ficuses in your front yard?,"I was gonna wait till he was single to ask him, but now he's flirting with Shauna again.",What do I do?,It's been nice talking to you.,What?,Maybe I should just do impressions.,"""I'ma Borat.",""" There's one.",But I need to do someone that no one has heard before.,"Like, I don't know, Neve Campbell?",What does Neve Campbell sound like?,I don't know.,"Someone,  tell me what Neve Campbell sounds like.",Just keep it short and get the hell out of there.,Thank you.,Our next guest has asked me to read this.,"Oh, no.","Oh, no, I forgot I did this.","Joan, no ""Strap on your adult diapers, everyone.","""Because you're about to wet yourself from laughter.",Give it up for Leslie Knope.,""" ""Whassup,"" Pawnee?",Um Borat.,"Well, that's my time.",They're giving me the light.,"So, uh, I did great.","Thank you, Leslie Knope.",You know what they say.,"Drama is hard, and sometimes comedy is not in our wheelhouse.","Tom, do you have to run that right now?","Oh, no, Ben!",These smoothies will just blend themselves!,Okay.,Think I have our winner.,It's called Rural Ambucare.,They want to buy an ambulance for people who live far away from the hospital.,Ambulances are dumb.,When has an ambulance ever helped anyone?,What about Andy's music thing?,"Well, this is a great service that will help a lot of needy people.","Sorry, Andy.",Why?,"No, it's totally fine.",I'm happy for them.,That's awesome.,You know what I'm gonna do?,"I'm gonna head out to, uh, the car.","It's a little hot in here, a little sweaty.","Well, I'm terribly disappointed.",But I'm sure the doctors or giraffes or whatever you decided to help will be thrilled with the whatever you decided to whatever.,I'm outtie.,"Great job, team.",What?,"Ever since Andy failed the police exam, he's been really depressed.",Picking out a dumb charity is the most excited he's been in weeks.,You're so selfish.,Selfish?,I'm running a charity.,"Oh, it's all about what you're doing, isn't it?",Classic Ben!,"Sorry, forgot the oysters.",Great work today.,Christopher.,"""Christoefur.",""" It's like you have furry toes.",Hilarious.,I have a question for you.,It's something very important.,Which is What is your Spirit animal?,Jaguar.,Why do you ask?,Doin' a survey.,"Well, survey completed.",So take 'er easy.,"Uh, you didn't ask me.","But if you had, the answer I would have given is Doggie.","Chris, Ann wants to ask you something right now.","Go, Ann.",In front of Perd?,Yes.,No more delays.,Go.,I want to have a baby.,Will you be the sperm donor?,The story of this situation is it's extremely personal.,Think it over.,Bye.,"Leslie, permission to leave the corner.",Denied.,"But, look, I did not lose your speech after all.",I forgot.,I put it in my shoe for safekeeping.,"It's a little moist, but it is still here.","Well, then how did Kim get the speech?",Wait a minute.,The Pawnee Sun has been one step ahead of me for months.,They knew that Kernston's withdrew its sponsorship of the Commons before I even announced it.,They asked me about the sewage eruption in Ramsett Park right after Ron emailed me about it.,And Kim asked me if I liked the first season Army Wives just moments after Netflix did.,The Pawnee Sun hacked my email.,I've been hacked!,"Okay, smashing your phone won't stop hacking.",That's also my phone.,"Jerry, quiet!",This is serious.,"Well, the police said they're gonna launch an investigation to see whether or not I was hacked.","But it's very complicated, and it could take up to a month.",There is nothing more disgusting than an invasion of privacy.,And I should know.,I've had many women steal my undershirts.,I have a press conference about the Pawnee Commons in two hours.,"So I need to go through every email that I've ever sent, ever.",I need to know what they might use against me.,You can't hack into a typewriter.,That's all I have to say.,"Can it, Unabomber.",This is an emergency.,"Hey, Ben.",Hi.,You wanted to talk to me?,Or probably not.,"I mean, I don't even want to talk to me.","No, I wanted to talk to you.",Oh.,"I just wanted to thank you so much for your help, Andy.",Sorry we didn't wind up choosing the afterschool music program.,It's just I totally get it.,"The music program would be effective, but the ambulance is gonna help people right now who are in trouble and will probably look good in the media.","Yeah, that's exactly right.","Your morning tea, Mr.",Wyatt.,Imagine all the money you could save if you didn't have to pay for this expensive stuff.,Am I right?,"You could help, like, a zillion more charities.","Yeah, that's also exactly right.",I feel like I should have thought of that.,"Well, let me tell you something else that's interesting, Ben.",What?,I farted five minutes ago.,Didn't even smell it till just now.,That's how tight my pants are.,"Anyhow Later days, dudes.","Okay, nothing too bad so far.","There's a ""Top Ten Ben's butt 2012 slide show.",""" You emailed it to Ben and Ann And The Huffington Post?","Yeah, I'm not embarrassed by that.",Who is Todo Toadfoot?,"You wrote him an email about riding your dragons to Pelennor Fields and signed it ""Dimple Broadbelt of Buckland.",""" Yes, that's Ben and my fantasy Lord Of The Rings pen pal letters.",I am a little embarrassed by that.,"Here's one to me, and it just says ""Thanks.",""" You're welcome.","Oh, great, I got a new email about the parking lot at the Pawnee Commons.",I keep getting emails all the time!,I have to do well at this press conference!,Donna!,"Listen, freaky.",Every single one of my boyfriends has tried to hack into my email.,I've got an idea Everybody out.,"Ann Perkins, I see you behind that attractive purse.",You haven't returned any of my calls.,"Yeah, that's because, uh, I'm mortified.",I'm so sorry that I was so weird and blunt., I am touched and honored that you would even consider me to be the father of your child., And I'm glad that you came right out and said it.," I mean, if we're really considering this, then we have to start at a place of complete honesty.", You're right., And I'll start now., You are a great specimen., That's a terrible choice of words., If my baby turned out to be anything like you I'd be lucky.," Can I have just a little bit of time to think about it? Of course, yes.", Take as much time as you want.," Or just maybe, like, a couple days.", 'Cause I'm getting antsy., And I'm ovulating on Thursday.," So, chop-chop.", But take your time.," Wear loose pants! I gotta tell you, Ron.", You were absolutely and totally right., I know., Stop talking and get out., Yep., The redneck ambulance is a great choice., We can release a publicity shot of a bucktoothed hayseed taking medicine for the first time in his life., We can figure out the photo later.," Oh, I forgot! It's Fondue Friday."," Yay! Yeah, also, as President of the foundation, I'm making a few changes.", I'm giving up this office., And no more visits from a masseuse or fancy lunches., It's way out of hand.," Sweetie, all the money we spend on the foundation is tax deductible."," I know, and it's a huge waste of money."," I mean, there's plenty of cheap office space around.", And I have an idea for how to use some of the money we'll save., Get yourself a matching nude portrait? - I can call the painter., - Please don't.," First, I'd like you all to check under your chairs.", I think you might be surprised and excited by what you find., - Is it chocolate? - Even better., It's dirt.," The EPA has recently reviewed our soil samples, and they determined that we achieved, and I quote, ""Minimal acceptable standards.",""" So not too shabby."," Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed construction will take 18 months, but a source tells me it will be much longer.", I would-- I would deny that report., I've also learned that the EPA found midi-chlorians in the soil.," How serious is that, exactly? It's very serious, Kim."," It's almost as serious as email hacking, which is what you have been doing to me for weeks.", I really thought you guys would gasp there., That is a baseless accusation., Midi-chlorians are a fictional substance found in the blood of Jedi knights from the movie Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.," Which, side-note, was a terrible movie."," It almost destroyed the franchise, according to my husband.", But that is neither here nor there.," The point is I sent Councilwoman Knope the fake email about the EPA finding midi-chlorians, an hour ago As a trap.", Into which you have fallen.," Well I have never seen Star Wars, because I was too busy hooking up with guys.", Unlike you losers.," Uh, you wanna compare numbers, Terlando? Get to steppin'."," I would just like to point out that Kim Terlando stole all of my jokes for the Pawnee Correspondents' Lunch, and they were great jokes.", So I spent the whole night writing new ones.," Lucky for you, let's get started.", I'm very excited to be here., You know who else is excited to be here? - Neve Campbell.," - Oh, boy.", What a great party of five.," All right, thank you, guys."," The point is, I could use someone to help me at the foundation as a part-time assistant but also an idea man.", Might I suggest Tom? He loves ideas., Also a man.," What-- No, Andy, I've already chosen the person."," And it is not Tom Then who is it? Well, he is, uh, sitting right here in this courtyard."," That guy? Do you even know him? Oh, my God, Andy, it's you.", I think you may have a knack for charitable giving., Will you come work for me? Uh-oh., What's happening? Oh.,   ,"
                ",Season: 5 Episode: 16,"RentASwag shareholders: As you can see, your store is hoppin'.",These kids are renting my old clothes like they're going out of style.,Which they never will.,"Yeah, it's a lot of foot traffic, Tommy.",I like it.,"Oh, ""dayyayyam,"" it is kind of a sausage party in here.","For the record, would hit it, would hit, would hit.",Hard pass.,"Tom, who is this person?","This is MonaLisa Saperstein, my new sales associate.",MonaLisa Saperstein?,"Does that mean   Oh, yeah she's my sister.","My twin sister, from the same mister.",Thank you so much for hiring MonaLisa.,It means so much to me.,"Even though, honestly, she's  The wooorst.",She is the worst person in the world.,Huge skank.,Terrible.,But thank you.,It means a lot.,Of course.,Got to keep it in the family.,"Yeah, but does it have to be this family?","Actually, that reminds me, Babababoss man I need to leave early today because my shrink got me and him tickets to a Pitbull concert.",And I already committed to that.,"And so if you say that I can't go, it's like you're taking something away from me.","Um, store's really busy.",I kinda need you to stay.,Mmhmm.,I totally hear you.,"Um, I also don't like what you're saying.","So if you say no, I will start a fire in the bathroom.","Okay, I guess you can go.","Yeah, I know I can.","What did I tell you, huh?",The woooorst.,She's the worst in the world.,JeanRalphio.,How are you?,Hello.,Welcome to Pawnee Videodome.,Today we'll be screening Stanley Kubrick's 1957 classic Paths Of Glory.,It's about three men who refuse to go on a suicide mission and are executed for cowardice.,"Or we could, you know, maybe screen a different movie.",One that's a little bit more upbeat.,"Like Finding Nemo or I could do, uh,Shoah.","Okay,Paths Of Glory it is.",This is the Pawnee Videodome.,And we are here because I started a program to help local business.,This is a Pawnee institution.,"This is the place where Perd Hapley shot his movie review show Lights, Camera, Perd.","It's a heartwarming story, but it's just not believable.",Which is why I give E.,T.,1 1/2 stars.,"Andy, it's over.","Get up, Andy.",What are you doing?,What's everybody where are we?,The reason I love that film is that it's really depressing.,"Speaking of which, sadly, next month, Pawnee Videodome will be closing its doors.",Forever.,No!,"For those of you that have attended our screenings, I want to thank you for your patronage, though I wish you would have rented more movies.","Guys, we have to help out Dennis and his business.","Everybody rent something, so we can help Dennis.","Sir, will you rent something?",Why would I do that?,All movies are online for free.,I'm watching Iron Man 2 on my phone right now.,"Okay, you're not helping.","I, for one, am going to rent Finding Nemo.","Ooh, we don't carry cartoons.","But if you want a film about the ocean, we have a documentary about the brutality of Japan's whaling industry.",It's called Tears Of My Blowhole.,And it'sit's nauseating.,I'll just buy some red vines.,"Oh, we only have Japanese slime candy and, um, Bulgarian wheat balls.","Leslie, seriously, where are we?",All these kids have fathers and mothers who have birthed them and are guiding them through life.,"Yep, that's how it works.",How are you feeling?,Did you make your dadcision yet?,I am 100% certain that I am 0% sure of what I'm going to do.,"Ann Perkins asked me if I would like to donate sperm, so she can have a baby.",It's a battle between my primal desire to bring a child into this world and my paralyzing fear of negatively affecting any living thing.,There's $60 missing from the register.,I think MonaLisa's stealing from me.,"Yeah, it is absolutely MonaLisa.",She's a total klepto.,And nympho and pyro all those things.,"Okay, as your CFO, I recommend getting rid of her immediately.",I'm throwing a huge cocktail party tomorrow for all my best clients.,I don't have time to find someone new.,This sucks.,"You know, when I was in high school, we had to spend a week carrying around a sack of flour, pretending it was a kid.","Why don't you make Tom your sack of flour, see how it feels to parent him a little?","Ben, that is literally the greatest idea in human history.","I heard ""sack of flour"" and ""high school.",""" Are you dingdongs making fake drugs for sophomores?","Because if true, this guy wants in.","Yeah, just have Mr.",Traeger call me when he gets back in.,"Actually, you know what?",Don't tell him that I called.,"Just when he gets there, can you text me and tell me he's back?",You know what?,"Let's just pretend this didn't happen, okay?",This is Jerry Gergich calling.,Bye.,I have to tell you a secret.,"But if you tell anyone, I will kill you slowly with a giant syringe.","Good morning, April.",What's your secret?,I'm thinking about applying to veterinary school in Bloomington.,"Oh, my God, April, that's great!",Whoa!,Where'd you get that?,The Internet.,So I really need a letter of recommendation.,"And since you work in a hospital,  as a janitor  Nurse.",I was wondering if maybe you would write one for me?,Really?,"Generally, between us, April always has the upper hand.",And that hand is usually giving me the finger or pouring honey in my purse.,But now I have the upper hand.,And I'm going to use it to crush her Into being nice to me.,I would be happy to write you that letter.,I actually know the guy who runs the veterinary program over there.,Because you hooked up with him?,I don't hook up with everyone I know.,"Although, yes, we did hook up.","But before I write you that letter, you have to spend the next week with me and do everything I say.",So I have to be your slave or something?,"No, you have to be my friend.","No, that is so much worse.",Don't do that.,I think I have a plan of how to save your store.,"If we get the Pawnee Historical Society to declare your store as a historical landmark, then you might get enough of a tax break to keep your business afloat.",That sounds like the government meddling in private enterprise.,"Well, Ron, we all know how much you love the free market.",But the Pawnee Videodome is the only place in town where people gather to do something intellectual.,That and the slam poetry nights at Beanie's Coffee.,But I do not count those because those poems do not rhyme.,Anything can be a slam poem if you say it like this.,It's pointless.,This man is a failure.,He is not up to snuff.,"His business is failing, and you're bailing it out.","This is a bailout, and I don't like it.",And there are some pretty intellectual conversations down at Barrett's Hardware.,"You may get a little heat for this, okay?",So use your money wisely.,Get popular films that people wanna see.,"Like, uh, get the Tarkovsky movies No.",Like Pixar.,Reese Witherspoon.,"I know this is gonna hurt, but maybe some Michael Bay.",What?,"No, no.",No.,"Tom, I have something I need to talk to you about.",Do we need to sit like this?,Yes.,MonaLisa's taking advantage of you.,And I'm sure that it's not easy when it's the sister of a dear friend.,"Oh, no, it's not that.",She scares the crap out of me.,I once saw her punch a police horse in the face.,"Speak directly to her and tell her, ""I will not be disrespected.",""" You're Tom Haverford.","You're a smart, successful young man with an adorable, little belly.",Stand up for yourself.,"Yeah, I'll talk to her before the party.","And if she murders me, tell JeanRalphio to clear my browser history.","Thanks for the advice, man.",You're welcome.,Son.,What's that?,Nothing.,All right.,Pawnee Videodome is where I rented my first Bruce Lee movie.,And my second Bruce Lee movie.,"And when I was in seventh grade, I went out back in the alley behind the store, and there was a giant hornet's nest.","And I threw a rock at it, and it exploded.",And hornets came out.,"Andy The point is, obviously, you do not throw rocks at a hornet's nest.","And the point is also that the Pawnee Videodome is a place with tremendous community value, where people gather to expand their horizons.",Any other comments here before we vo Ron?,What are you doing at a city council meeting?,Are you lost?,Are you hurt?,"No, I am here to express an opinion.",This action by Councilwoman Knope is nothing more than a thinly veiled government bailout.,"And I, for one, refuse to let her turn this town into a socialist hellscape.",Allow me to elaborate.,The government should not prop up a failed business.,That would be like giving food to a mortally wounded animal instead of slitting its throat and properly utilizing its meat and pelt.,Please stop talking about wounded meat.,Pawnee needs a place where the community can gather to discuss and appreciate art.,A place where you can rent such films as Cinema Paradiso or Rashomon.,You rented Rashomon?,What was your favorite part of that?,"I haven't rented it, actually, yet.",But I like the idea that there is a place where I could rent Rashomon.,"Uh, you can just watch it online, for free, whenever you want.",Bailiff!,"Thank you, Mr.","Swanson, for your absurd opinion, which is shared by no one.","Now, are there any more public comments before we vote?",Mm.,How much to rent this jacket?,Oh.,"Curly Sue, that jacket is so ugly.",You should just take it.,"It's 15 for the day, Thank you.",We appreciate your business.,MonaLisa!,Did you order the champagne for the client party tonight?,"Did I order the what for the whatwhat what, what?",What are you even talking about right now?,"Okay, we need to discuss your work habits.","Okay, sure, but after I take a quick nap because ecstasy takes  forever to leave my system No.",We're doing this now.,You need to start putting in more of an effort and start respecting my authority around here!,Or else what?,Or else I'll fire you.,What did you just say?,"I said, if you don't shape up, I'll fire you.",Do you understand?,"You are so freaking sexy right now, I could crap my pants.",Ugh.,What are you doing?,"I guess it would have to be Channing Tatum's body, Ryan Gosling's face, and Michael Fassbender's sense of humor.",What about you?,Build your perfect guy.,"Um Yao Ming's torso, Napoleon's brain, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame's hunchback.",Do you like my nails?,"Even though she hides it underneath layers of sarcasm, resentment, and grumpiness, I know, deep down somewhere, April likes me.",I'm kind of just fracking for friendship.,"Gene Strackwell, owner of Strackwell Hardware.",Is there a form I need to fill out for the bailout?,We're not bailing anyone out.,Pawnee Videodome is receiving historical landmark status.,We've been around way longer than that stupid art house movie bullcrap.,And people need places to buy tools.,"Uh, you can just buy tools online.","Bailiff, why is he back in here?",How did you get back in here?,I'll see myself out.,Don't worry about it.,I heard you were giving out free money.,"I need $3,000.",Minimum.,Mr.,"Fantringham, the city of Pawnee is not gonna give you a personal loan.","What would you do if one of your citizens was about to come into some serious physical harm Unless he got $3,000?",I'd call the police.,You cannot call the police.,"Wilson Gromling of the ""Liberty or Die"" party.",These government handouts are deplorable.,You're just handing out blank checks.,I was on food stamps.,I was on Welfare.,And nobody ever helped me.,This is not a blank check.,I have given specific instructions to the Pawnee Videodome about how they are going to spend their money.,"In a few days, Dennis will reopen.","The store will serve a wider range of Pawnee's citizens, and a Pawnee cultural institution will be saved.",Are there any other comments?,Yes.,"The Pawnee chapter of the ""Liberty or Die"" party has hit some hard times.",We were wondering if maybe the town could loan us some money.,Mmhmm.,"Tom, how did it go with MonaLisa?","I told her she needed to change her attitude, or I was gonna have to fire her.","Well, that is very responsible and mature.",She took it well?,Um yeah.,"For some reason, she got super turned on.",We started making out.,Hard.,"Next thing you know, we're back at my place, having sex.",We're together now.,"Hey, bitch, I need to borrow some money to do something that is none of your damn beeswax, namely, I need to wax my bee.",Here you go.,I'd still hit it.,I'm coolin' on you.,See?,Perfect!,"Okay, you have to choose one.",I can't think.,These braids you did are making my brain hurt.,Fine.,Miranda.,"No, I think you're a Charlotte.",You're like a scary Charlotte.,Hey.,"Hey, you.",What's what's up?,Nothin'.,This is weird.,"No, it's not.","Yeah, it is.",Why is it weird?,It's not weird.,Do you want to talk in private?,"No, anything you can say to Ann, you can say to me because we're best friends this week.",Ccan we talk later?,Yeah.,Okay.,Why don't you talk now?,"No, talk to you later.","Chris, we can talk now.","What's going on, best friend?","Nothing, never mind.",Tell me.,Nothing's happening.,Back to forced friendship.,"Hey, let's go put on our pj's and make White Russians.",So fun.,Councilwoman.,"I just came down to see the effects of your government intervention, and I've got to hand it to you You really turned this place around.",Really?,"Oh, my God, this is amazing, Dennis.",Hey.,You did it!,We did it!,I did it.,This is me.,"Yes, it was.",I took your advice.,"Got rid of all those dusty, old foreign films and used the money for the part of our business that's always done pretty well for us.","Give the people what they want, right?",This isn't what people want.,It's definitely what that guy wants.,I like this store now.,Do you realize what you have done?,The Pawnee government now effectively owns a porn shop.,You have made us porn peddlers!,"Hello everyone, I'm Brandi Maxxxx.",Let's give a big round of applause to Councilwoman Knope for keeping this store in business!,No.,Everyone stop applauding.,"For the record, I was just trying to help a place that had tremendous cultural value.","Leslie, you've always been a huge supporter of my work.","No, no, I haven't.",So I'm thrilled to tell you that I'm playing Leslie Knope in the porn version of the story of this government bailout!,Please don't do that.,"Oh, we already filmed it.",Oh!,The porn industry in town was really faltering.,But now we're back.,You're our hero!,Oh!,Okay.,Are you ready?,For you to tell me what's going on with Chris?,Yes.,No.,To sing.,"If you're lost, you can look   and you will find me  time after time go.","No, tell me about Chris.","If you fall, I will catch you   I'll be waitin' Tell me about Chris, or I'm leaving, and I don't care about the letter.","I wanna have a baby, and I asked Chris to donate his sperm.","And he's taking a really long time to make up his mind, and it's really freaking me out.","And I can't stop thinking about it, and I'm obsessing about it, and I want to think about anything else but that, but it's making me crazy.",Secrets stolen  from deep inside.,You know this song already?,Of course I do.,Everyone knows this song.,It's amazing.,"The drum beats out of time   if you're lost, you can look   and you will find me  time after time  if you fall, I will catch you   oh, I'll be waiting  time after time  time after time  time after time.",This never happened.,I made everything worse.,"If Tom were a bag of flour, that flour would never grow up to be a happy, welladjusted loaf of bread.","Much less a bran muffin, which is the highest honor that flour can achieve.","Okay, so you're really gonna say no to Ann?","I care about Ann very deeply, but I just don't know if I'm cut out to be a dad.","You know, Chris, every parent makes mistakes.","I mean, lord knows I've made plenty.",But it's the small victories that keep you going.,"When you see your little one take her first step oror graduate college, oh, my God, it just makes it all worth it.","And another thing is if If, like If I You know, and then your kid's because you're likevrrrr I don't know.","And everyone's like, ""Oh.",""" Oh, I'm sorry, guys.",Ino one ever lets me talk this long.,I just got lost.,It was a beautiful point.,"And very well said, right up until that moment that you started babbling incoherently.",And I'll have the number eight.,That's a party platter.,It serves 12 people.,"I know what I'm about, son.","Go ahead, Ron.",Let me have it.,"Oh, wait, I'll do it for you.","I told you so, Leslie.",This is what happens when the government interferes with business.,"Government is bad, business is good.",Free market.,"Capitalism is the only way, Leslie.",It moves our country forward.,It's what makes America great.,And England okay and France terrible.,I like capitalism.,I love competition.,I'm more competitive than you.,I don't think so.,I think so.,Settle down.," - No, settle up."," 'Cause the bill's been paid, and I've paid it, and I've won."," Look, the point is there has to be a way for the government to help places that add community value but don't necessarily rake in the money.", There is not., The free market is a jungle., It's beautiful and brutal and should be left alone.," When a business fails, it dies, and a new, better one takes its place.", Just let business be business and government be government., Here you go., And one number eight.," All right, party time."," I would suggest sticking around and watching him eat it 'cause it only takes four minutes, and it's pretty amazing.", These will not be necessary.," Here is your letter of recommendation, so you're off the hook.", No need to pretend to be my friend anymore., Thank God.," I can't tell if you actually hate me or if this is just how you are, but I had fun hanging out with you."," So I don't care what you say, you're my friend."," And I hope you get into veterinary school because I like you, so there.", I got you something too., A baby-naming book., I hope it works out with Chris.," And if it doesn't, I hope it works out with someone.", We're gonna hug now., - No., - Yeah.," Ow! You're hurting me! Mm! Lot of hot ""D"" in here tonight."," Ooh, look at that chunky hunky.", Go over there and talk to him and find out what his deal is.," No, I'm not gonna talk to some other guy."," When we're together, you can't check out other guys.", That's the deal.," Or else it's over between us, you understand? Mm! Tommy laying down the law.", A little feisty.," I like that, okay? I'ma go get a soda.", Do you want to have sex somewhere after I do that? - Sure., - All right., Well., Looks like things with Mona-Lisa are Continuing., Yeah., I think I'm gradually transforming her from truly terrible to only kinda terrible.," It's the small victories, you know? Indeed.", The small victories.," I know she's kind of a monster, but whatever.", I'm young., She's sexy., I'm just gonna see where this roller coaster goes., Fair enough., Is there anything else you need help with? Have you learned how to ride a bike yet? Yeah., I'm 28 years old.," I'm proud of you, bud.", Thanks! Ann Perkins.," Is that a happy ""Ann Perkins,"" or is that a bad-news ""Ann Perkins""? Oh, happy.", Obviously., The bad-news one sounds like this.," ""Ann Perkins.",""" Oh."," Well, I've thought about it.", And I'm in., I want to be a parent.," I want to raise a child, with all the ups and downs and challenges that comes with it."," Chris, this is so great.", - I'm so happy., - Me too.," Well, I guess your uter-you and my uter-me are now our uter-us.", Don't make me change my mind.," Although we are all sad and deeply grossed out that the Pawnee Videodome is turning into a porno palace, I am happy to announce that the Pawnee government will be hosting a weekly movie night here at the Community Center.", There will be free screenings followed by a discussion led by local film buff Dennis Lerpiss., Tonight's film is The Sound Of Music., And action.," I'm glad you're here, Dong Swanson.", The local video store's about to go under., We have to save it.," Oh, this is the wrong movie."," We ne-- shut this down, please.", - Shut it down.," - Sorry, Leslie."," I'm a strict libertarian, and I don't believe in bailouts.", This is not how it happened., _   ,"
                ",Season: 5 Episode: 17,I'm looking for Ronald Ulysses Swanson?,He stepped out.,Can I take a message?,Sure.,Tell him he just won a free dinner from St.,Elmo steak house.,I'm Ron Swanson!,You've been served.,Have a nice day.,I don't like you.,But I respect the effort.,"Oh, man, subpoena?","Which exwife is it, Tammy one or Tammy two?",Neither.,Apparently councilman Jeremy Jamm is not pleased that I punched him in the face on the night of Leslie's wedding.,He's suing me.,"$13,000 for orthodontic surgery, $6,000 for enamel repair, and $46 million for psychological damages.","Yeah, that seems about accurate.",That guy is the worst.,We should sue Jamm's parents for spawning a human turdburger.,"Ron, hey, let me be your lawyer.","I'll object to everything anyone says, trial will go on forever, you don't have to pay.",Problem solved.,"That's a kind offer, Andrew, but I won't be hiring an attorney.","I'll represent myself, as I do in all legal matters and livestock auctions.",I wish we had $46 million.,We could buy my parents' house and evict them.,Surprised he's taking it this well.,Aghh!,"April, could you call maintenance please?","Parks and Recreation S05E17 Partridge Okay, move a little bit to your left and then turn to the side.","Okay, and freeze.","That is the exact spot where an 18yearold Ben Wyatt was inaugurated as mayor of Partridge, Minnesota.","Oh, well, thank you very much.","Yes, congratulations to you.",I don't know.,I have chills.,Can't believe they're finally giving me the key to the city.,I can't believe it took so long.,"They gave the key to every other mayor in the town's history, and I guarantee that none of them had as cute a butt as you do.",And none of them caused the city's unemployment rate to hit 30%.,You're so sexy when you talk about percentages.,"When Ben was mayor, he sunk all of the town's money into a winter sports complex called ""Ice Town,"" and they went bankrupt.","Now they've invited him back as a gesture of goodwill, and he'll finally get some closure on this miserable chapter in his life.","Yay, Ben!",Town hero!,Yes!,Whoo!,"Well, if it isn't the defendant, Ron Swansuck.","Why are you doing this, Jamm?",This lawsuit is Chronicles of Riddickulous.,I'll tell you why.,It's 'cause I'm sick of this whole Parks and Rec gang.,That's why.,This munch throws me into a swimming pool.,"The nurse still won't have sex with me, and she's not even queer.",Now Swansuck punches me in the mouth.,"It's what we in the Jamm family call ""Payback time.",""" Everyone calls it that.","Yeah, because I invented it.","Yeah, you're not gonna win $50 million, you freak.","Maybe not, but I'm not not going to win nothing.",Paul.,That guy is a joke.,This lawsuit is definitely getting thrown out.,"I don't know, those are JeanRalphio's lawyers.","They once got him $60,000 'cause he got too scared at a haunted house.","Okay, are you done?",Are we done?,Did we win?,You can't win this.,You can win at anything.,Last year I won an organic gardening contest.,Who were you competing against?,My own taste buds.,"I wanna have a baby, and Chris has agreed to be the father.",My fertility counselor showed me this online quiz that determines whether we'd be compatible parents.,"If this were the '80s, all we'd have to do is, like, not drop an egg for a whole day.",Stupid Internet.,"Okay, our official coparenting score is Not amazing.","Oh, I think it's fantastic.",I think it's literally the best score we could have hoped for.,Not sure that that's true.,"Oh, snap!",I just filled it out for fun.,Chris and I are 81% compatible.,"You wanna make a baby, traeger?","Your hair, my everything else.",That kid would be unstoppable.,"Guys, I couldn't resist.",I did it too.,Ann and I got 84%.,"Well, this sucks.","Yes, we did not win.","So was, like, Ben a bossy older brother?",Did he make you watch star war movies?,Make me?,I loved those movies just as much as he did.,That's so cute.,"Oh, you do a lot of hugging.","Yeah, get used to it.",We're sisters now.,"Benji, I'm really glad you came back for this.",A lot of jerks around here didn't think you'd show up.,"Well, I wasn't sure, but Leslie gave me the extra push, and I figured it'd be nice to put the ice town thing behind me once and for all.","Now that you're both here, let's get started.",Just have a few questions.,You have a binder?,That's right.,"Who were Ben's high school girlfriends, and what base do you think he got to?",Um  What's that?,And what exactly did you witness?,"Defendant, alias Ron Swanson, alias my boss, used appropriate force to prevent further damage to the wedding of Leslie Knope, alias my other boss.",You sound as if you have a special interest in law enforcement.,"Yes, sir.","In fact, at the time, I was trying to become a police officer but was deemed unfit for the force.",And what happened?,Don't know.,"Well, I pooched the brain exam.","Just to be safe, I wouldn't take anything I say too seriously.","Next witness, your honor.",Ms.,"Ludgate, have you ever heard Mr.",Swanson threaten to hurt councilman Jamm?,Ronny?,Are you kidding me?,I've never heard him threaten to hurt anyone or anything.,"The guy's, like, a vegetarian.","Look at him, he's like a big, old, soft teddy bear.","His nickname around the office is ""SoftyPants McHuggable.",""" Did you ever hear Mr.",Swanson say he intended to injure councilman Jamm before the day of the wedding?,"The answer is a flat ""no.",""" Ron doesn't really pay much attention to other people.",I doubt he even knew you existed.,"Also, may I say for the record, that is a dope pocket square.",Can I see that bad boy?,Tom and April were excellent witnesses in my defense.,"Unfortunately, every single word out of their mouths was a lie.",There's only one thing I hate more than lying.,Skim milk.,Which is water that's lying about being milk.,"Despite everything that happened 20 years ago, this will always be my hometown.",Are you crying again?,"It's just every time you say that speech, I think about where you've been and where you're going and our future children and America and just our history as a nation.","Wow, I didn't think about all that, but I thought it was good.","Thanks, Steph.","Ah, I'm feeling sweaty.","Do I look swe I feeloh, I need to use the bathroom one more time.","That's, like, five times in an hour.","Well, somebody's nervous about the ceremony.",I don't blame him.,He didn't exactly leave Partridge as the most popular guy in town.,Ben?,"Oh, my God.",Are you okay?,I think I'm giving birth.,Is that possible?,"No, right?","No, no, no, no.","Oh, God!",I'll call an ambulance.,"Oh, God!",It's twins!,I'm having twins!,Oh!,Okay.,Kidney stone?,Big sucker too.,We're gonna have to keep him here until it passes.,Leslie and Dr.,"Clipperton Wow, man, I'm so glad you guys are meeting.",It's like worlds collide.,"You know, I love it.",I want candy.,What is he on?,Morphine.,It's good stuff.,"Leslie, come here.",Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?,I'm serious.,You're like a flower.,"Or, no, like a snugbug or like a snuggerdoodle or something like that.","We should just go for it, you know?",Life.,We have a ceremony we need to be at in two hours.,Is there anything that we can do?,"Sorry, Ice Town, you're not going anywhere for at least a day.","Okay, well, I'll call mayor Stice, and we'll reschedule the ceremony.","No, this town expects me to wuss out.","I'm making that speech, and I'm simply gonna explain to the crowd that love is everywhere and they have to surrender to the flow of the universe, you know?","Price Is Right is on, I think.","Oh, you remember staying home sick from school watching the price is right?","Oh, God.","Look, I know that this is just a silly quiz, but it is so discouraging to do so poorly.","Well, look, this is not the only way to see if we would be good parents.","I know it's a little lame, but I bought a dozen eggs at the grocery store, and I thought we could do that thing where we pretend the egg is a kid for a day.",That's a great idea!,I don't see them.,"Oh, my God.",I left them at the grocery store.,"Oh, boy.","I bought 12 babies, and then I immediately abandoned them at a Kroger's.","Look, we can use anything as a baby.","I mean, we could use this mug.",I don't understand.,I was great.,"I was like Mark Z in The Social ""N.",""" My testimony was amazing for your case.",But it wasn't the truth.,And neither was yours.,You even called me a vegetarian.,What if that testimony leaks?,How will people ever respect me?,"Ugh, whatever.",The truth is stupid.,I only tell the truth when it makes me sound like I'm lying.,"Yeah, lying is all I know.","It's how I was able to scrape by on the streets of Bombay and make it on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and get reunited with the love of my life, Latika.",You could both take a lesson from Andrew.,"He told the truth about everything he was asked, even when it was humiliating for him.",That's right.,I love telling the truth.,"Case in point, sometimes when I blow my nose, I get a boner.",I don't know why.,It just happens.,Truth bomb.,"I'm gonna call you both back in that room, and you'll recant your testimony.",No!,You committed perjury.,"But more importantly, you've dishonored yourselves.","Oh, brother.",They are so young.,So much to learn.,What are you talking about?,"I know, right?",Wisdom.,Sick?,Do you really expect me to believe that?,"What has he got, acute wimping out?","No, he has kidney stones.",We have proof.,"Yeah, I took a video of him at the hospital an hour ago.",I feel like I never gave miles Davis proper shrift.,"Like, I just didn't get into it.",But the good news is I'm here to accept the key on his behalf.,"Boy, it's just a real shame it had to happen today of all days.",Damn it!,Excuse me.,Hi.,Everything okay?,You want me to come back to the hospital?,"Pfft, nah.",I'm goodie goodie.,"You just do your thing, baby smurf.","I mean, I wish you were here.",It seems pretty fun and festive.,Town mascot is here.,Fred the Sled?,They only bring him out for special occasions.,I can't believe they're doing all this for me.,The universe is love.,"Okay, stay away from sharp things.","Well, well, well, heard you want to recant your earlier statements.","Yes, I misremembered some things.",I did in fact hear Ron Swanson say he intended to injure Jeremy Jamm.,"Boom, knew it.","Tell us about it, please.",Which time?,"Well, how many were there?","Well Yeah, we did a trade.","I gave his wife new enamels, he gave my wife new yabbos.",Who's that gentleman?,"Jeremy Jamm, city councilman.",You don't know him?,Never met him.,He looks like he could use a swift punch in the face though.,Yes!,"And then before he can say anything, I just run over, shove him into the pool.",Bully for you.,"If it were me, I would have just punched him in the face.","What's up, Ron?",Just daydreaming about punching Jamm in the face.,And there were a few other times too.,"We get the picture, son.",Hold on.,"We need your full, truthful testimony on record.","Keep going, Tom.","But now, 20 years later, the city has finally healed from the festering wound of Ice Town.","Today we put those horribly painful memories behind us as we welcome back the mayor who made all of that possible, Ben Wyatt.","Oh, that's a typo.",That's a major typo.,"That says ""Ice Clown.",""" I'm just realizing now that's not a typo.","Hey, aren't you his sister?",I gotta get outta here.,"Good luck, Leslie.","Here to accept the key to the city of Partridge, because Mr.","Wyatt is conveniently ill, is his wife Leslie Knope.",And it's water.,"Uhoh, the key was made of ice.","And much like the hopes and dreams of the people of Partridge, it melted away.","Again, this would all be way more satisfying if Ben was here.","Okay, excuse me.","I would like to point out that we drove all the way here from Pawnee, Indiana, a city with some class, by the way.","And, sure, my husband made an honest mistake 20 years ago.","But it was very meaningful that you were gonna finally  Hi, Leslie.",Be able to forgive him.,"If it's so meaningful to him, then where is he?","He's in the hospital, sir.",He has a calcified rock lodged in his penis!,"Frankly, Ben Wyatt is the best thing to ever come out of this crap town.","Oh, yeah?",What about Judy Garland?,Judy Garland's from Partridge?,She lived here for a while.,And Lee Janzen.,Who's Lee Janzen?,He's a golfer.,He's pretty good.,"Well, Ben Wyatt's better than Lee Janzen, and he's better than Judy Garland.",That's crazy.,Judy Garland's amazing.,"But Ben Wyatt is better than all of you because he cared about this town, and he tried to help it.","You know, screw you, Partridge.",And a sled is a stupid mascot.,"Thank you, Ms.",Ludgate.,"It is now quite clear that on innumerable occasions Ron Swanson said he intended to punch councilman Jamm in the face, and then he did.","Yeah, but who cares?",He says a lot of things.,"He's always talking about overthrowing the government, but he never does that.","Well, that'll make a nice pull quote for the article about me taking you to the cleaners.",Mr.,"Swanson, if you'd like to make a statement, you may.","On the night I punched councilman Jamm in the face, I warned him several times to back off.","And instead, he attacked me twice.","Truthfully, I barely registered his attack.","He's incredibly frail, and his arms are weak.","And when I punched him, he dropped so quickly, I thought he was diving towards the ground.",I regret nothing.,The end.,"Well, this turned out better than I ever imagined.",You got Jammed by your own team.,SelfJamm!,"I'll see you in court, Swanson, and, uh, bring your checkbook.",I would like to punch you in the face again.,"Okay, Paul, let's go.",I'm glad you're feeling better.,"Well, get your normal conversation in with me while you can.",Got about 20 minutes before I get all loopy again.,"Mm, let me see the key.","Oh, uh, they took it back.",They wanted to get it engraved.,Huh.,"You know, the key is just a metaphor.","I mean, the real key has been inside you all along.","It was a setup, wasn't it?",They were gonna make fun of me?,Yes.,Ice Town was a debacle.,They'll never get over it.,Just don't know why I got my hopes up.,It's so unfair.,You worked so hard.,You've done so many great things.,"And for your hometown to treat you this way is just You know what, screw this.",We're gonna make one more stop before we leave.,Tuck in your shirt.,We're going to city hall.,"So, Dr.","Van Dyne, we took the compatibility test that you recommended, and we didn't do amazing.","But I'm sure that happens with a lot of couples, right?",And it's not like we failed.,"We got a 58%, which as I'm saying it, sounds very clearly like we failed.","Look, there are many ways to judge compatibility.","Okay, you know what, let's do a little exercise.","I'm gonna say something about your future child, and then you just say the first thing that pops into your mind.",Okay?,Gender.,Girl.,Boy.,Okay.,Religion.,Buddhist.,Whatever he wants.,Whatever he wants.,"Um, how 'bout occupation?",Teacher.,Sixtime tour de France champion.,Really?,"Okay, I'm sorry, are you guys complete strangers?",Is this one of those craigslist father situations?,"No, no, no.",We actually know each other quite well.," Yeah, we used to date actually, but it didn't work out because we had some compatibility issues."," You know what, why don't we just try one more compatibility test? - Great, let's do it! - No, let's not."," Okay, well, we all told the truth, and Jamm's definitely going to win.", What do we do now? I intend to do as the court orders., Do you know if one can pay court-ordered settlements in gold? All of my money's in gold., I also have some money in palladium., What if it's a huge amount? Are you gonna be okay financially? I think so., I'm actually not sure how much money I have., But I do know how many pounds of money I have.," Whoa, whoa, that is awesome."," Yes, it is, and I'm definitely tweeting that to Drake to use in his next rhymes, but still I kinda feel like this is our fault."," Ugh, do we have to do something nice now? Let me start by apologizing, mayor Stice.", I had no right to disparage your town.," Well, I owe you guys an apology too."," I, uh, had a little bad publicity lately, and frankly, it's still really easy to score points by bashing Wyatt."," Can't you just give Ben a key to the city, here, now, in your office, where no one will know your shame? - Sorry, babe.", - No worries., I love you., Aw.," You know, if people found out I gave Wyatt the key to the city, I would never get re-elected.", So no.," What are you doing there, Wyatt? I'm feeding your eagle.", He's starving.," It's it's bronze, babe.", - Why? - The eagle-- We should go., - Yeah., Ann Perkins., I know it didn't seem to go very well at the counselor's.," But I have found a new quiz, and I think we should take it.", Are you sure? Everything we do makes it seem like it's a bad idea for us to have a kid together., Maybe we shouldn't even be friends., Take a look.," ""Will you love our child and work hard to see that he or she has a good life?"" You see, I think that's the only question that matters.", All the rest of it is details., Yes., The answer is yes., I said the exact same thing., We're 100% on the same page.," Are you sure about this? You are caring, intelligent, and reliable.", And I am certain that you will literally be the world's best mom., Wow., This is really happening.," - You know there's nothing in there yet, right? - Yes, sorry."," No, I was with Johnny Cougar Mellencamp at that music fest."," We both thought, biggest yabbos we've ever seen in-- What the hell? That was important."," Game's over, councilman.", Drop the suit., And why exactly would I do that? We took a look at your affidavit.," We cross-referenced it with telephone records and eyewitness accounts, and, uh-oh, we found 11 lies."," Lying under oath is called perjury, and they should know, they did it yesterday."," Well, I mean, maybe I accidentally said something that wasn't-- Let me see that."," Ow! My wrist! You twisted my arm like a maniac! - Oh, no! - You monster."," Ow! You assaulted me, and I'm injured! Oh, my God, Tom, are you okay? All right, you know what, I see what you're doing.", I barely touched you., That's not what I saw., My face! Is my face still there? What happened to my knees? Someone please tell me if Tom is okay.," - Jamm, I'm gonna sue you."," - Okay, fine."," Hey, listen, keep your mouths shut about the affidavit, I'll drop the suit, okay? Hurry, Tom, let's get you into surgery! Yeah."," Yeah, it's me.", We got Jammed., My friend Jack and I used to fish this lake in the summer.," One time, our boat almost tipped over, but then it didn't.", That's not a great story.," Yeah, I had a pretty uneventful childhood.", I got you something., - No way., - Yeah., Where did you get that? I stole it from mayor Stice's office., Screw that guy., You should have it., You're the best wife in the world., But I don't want this.," Really? Yeah, I mean, I love Partridge, but I have Pawnee now.", And I have you.," Well, I'm not giving it back to Stice.", - That guy sucks., - Yeah.," Well, you know what then? Hey, lake's not a garbage can, pal."," Yeah, sorry, it was symbolic."," Is that Ben Wyatt? Get the hell out of here, Ice Town! - Run! Run! - Go, go, go, go, go.", Sorry.,   ,"

for a dog.","""Bark Obama.",""" Right?",Is that what's happening here?,Oh.,Yo.,Yeah.,We found this bird outside.,"We tried to turn it into a work whistle, like in the beginning of The Flintstones.","Tougher than it looked, though.","We have a massive pest problem in this town, and it's because the Animal Control Department has been disaster at catching animals.",They're great at ingesting and selling marijuana.,This place is a miserable suck hole run by two pothead losers.,It's completely and utterly mismanaged.,Thanks!,"It does seem to be very poorly run, but we've only been here for two minutes.",There may be a method to their madness.,There's more than one way to skin a cat.,Four.,There's four ways to skin a cat.,Regular blade Ow!,Ah!,What is this?,"Coyote trap, dude.",Ah!,This hurts!,"Yeah, we got, like, a huge vermin problem.","I mean, we've been meaning to call somebody about it, but you know, nobody get on the phone.",You're the people you would be calling.,That is so trippy.,Ow!,You're fired!,You're fired!,The whole department is fired.,"Ow, this hurts!",This was one of my running feet!,"Yo, let's go to Jamaica.","No, we should go to Jamaica.","Oh, is that what you said?","Yeah, dog.","Ron, you've been sweating in here all day.",Are you drinking any fluids?,"Yes, plenty.","No, you need to drink water.","Usually, I take it neat, but I will make an exception in the name of health.","Last night, I watched a movie with Diane and the girls in which an orange fish is separated from his father.","The children were sniffling, which I believed to be due to the sad nature of the film.",I was wrong.,"You need to take off those layers, rehydrate, and go to the doctor.","Thank you for your concern, I will be fine.",Please turn the thermostat up to 90 and leave me alone.,"Ron, this isn't safe.",I am a grown man.,"I have had a cold before, I need no help, so if you don't mind That seems about right.","Okay, pop quiz.",Name the scent.,"Uh, ""Spasm.",""" No, ""Butter Face""!",Very good!,Yes!,"I'm trying to get more big companies to donate to the Sweetums Foundation, and tom got us a meeting with Dennis Feinstein, Pawnee's premiere manufacturer of perfumes and cologne.",Oh!,"Or possibly, insecticide.",Whew!,"Dennis Feinstein belongs to a new generation of wealth rappers, tech geniuses, X games medallists, and of course, ""scent artists.",""" The man owns a Rolexus.",It's a Lexus filled with Rolexes.,What's the point of that?,"To have it, which he does.","Okay, I'll lay out the benefits of donating.",Tom will flatter and schmooze as only tom can.,"Andy, you know, this is just a learning experience for you, so you just watch and listen.","I had to pull a lot of strings to get this meeting, so please, no one embarrass me.","Ben, put on something decent, like a tux.","Andy, you're hopeless, just take a shower.","I already took what I call a ""dwyer shower.",""" I rubbed my armpits with air fresheners.",New car.,Animal control has long been a repository for some of this government's most incompetent employees.,Jerry Gergich got his start there.,Well.,"All right, well.","Yeah, so our new director needs to be competent, effective, and not completely stoned all the time.","I'm way ahead of you there, girly.",I got the perfect guy.,"Friend of mine, bit of an alcoholic, a little grabby, either a war hero or war criminal, depending on who you ask, but a good dude.",How do you know him?,I do his teeth.,"A few coffee stains up front, but his canines are insane.","Gosh, Jeremy, he sounds perfect.",Are his gums great too?,"Oh, yeah.","They are excellent, beet red.",I was being sarcastic.,I think we should open this to the floor  for more discussion.,"Uh, maybe you would like to explain this to her, please?","Traditionally, Leslie, the councilmen just kind of take turns on departmental appointments.","Yeah, this one is mine, then Dexhart, then you.",This whole place runs on dibs.,Are you kidding me?,You guys are all fine with this?,"Well, Milton's asleep, but the rest of you?",This is how departments get mismanaged.,No.,We are going to be thorough.,"I'm going to find a candidate, and I encourage you all to do the same, and then, we will interview all of them.",Boring!,"""Boring"" is my middle name, so my thoroughly vetted candidate is going to blow your candidate out of the water.","Oh, I guess I'm leaving.",Good to see you.,Great meeting!,I'd like to object again to being brought here against my will.,"Okay, I'm just gonna doublecheck your form here.",Ron!,You redacted all the information.,I answered some of them.,"For ""date of birth,"" you wrote ""springtime.","""  Which is true.",Everything you write down is confidential.,We need you to give real answers.,Fine.,How many drinks of alcohol do you consume a week?,One.,"That's it, one drink?",One shelf.,Do you exercise?,Yes.,Lovemaking and woodworking.,Do you have any history of mental illness in your family?,I have an uncle who does

right to the chase.,I don't like charity.,I don't get it.,"Feels to me like I'm giving money away, and getting nothing in return.","Well, that's not true.",You can really help your personal brand if you show that you're a mogul that gives as much as he gets.,"If I give as much as I get, I'm giving $20 million.",Ay yi yi.,"That's how much I'm worth, Yeah.","Yeah, yeah, yeah.","Ah, he's disgusting, but I want to take his money and give it to needy people, so I'm just gonna keep on smiling.",Yay!,"People who give to charity, they get amazing press.",Huh.,Like Bill Gates.,Have you ever heard of Bill Gates?,"He lives in Seattle, guy with glasses.",Bill Gates?,I know who Bill Gates is.,"Bill Gates is, like, a super nerd.",Is this some sort of nerd thing?,Are you calling me a nerd?,"Uh, he meant Mark Cuban.",Cuban?,"Now, that's the kind of guy I can hang out with Mark Cuban.",Yeah.,I'm interested now.,Keep talking.,Stay still.,"""Don't think about how much this itches.",""" That's very good advice.","I have to say, this is the greatest search committee ever assembled to find a new Animal Control Department head.",Chris Traeger can do more with one foot than most people can do with three.,I'm not going to lie to you.,I needed that.,I know.,April Ludgate is beautiful  Stop.,You are talented  No.,"But most importantly, you're passionate about animals.",That's true.,It's because I'm half wolf.,"Okay, Donna, you took a look at all the resumes, so send in the best candidate.",Wassup?,I'm Harris.,I'm 33 years young.,I have my cousin Jason's truck for two more weeks.,I have one testicle whacamole accident and I'm down to clown.,"Harris, we know who you are.",I literally just fired you.,"Oh, is this that job?",That's crazy!,Never mind.,Why would you think Harris would be the best candidate?,'Cause he's one of only two applicants with actual experience at animal control.,Uhohh.,Does that mean What up?,"Yo, my name is Brett.","I like burgers, and also, I'm very high right now.","Dude, this is hilarious!","Oh, yo!",We live together!,"Yo, we live in the same place!",This is my boy!,"Hey, ""Wyld Stallyns""!",You guys know why there are all those cops out there?,Where are the cops at?,I gotta go.,Yo.,"A lot of charities waste their money on overhead, but we at the Sweetums Foundation,  spend our money wisely.",Okay.,You know what?,Shut up.,All right.,"You guys seem like pretty cool dudes and I'm feeling pretty generous, so why don't we take this conversation to the Pawnee Smokehouse?","DumbDumb Eddie, get the checkbook.",We're going out.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!","Guys, we're going out.",Let's scent up!,"I call dibs on ""Ooze.","""  I got ""Money Shot.","""  Yeah.","I got ""Blood Spurt.",""" Ooh, no, don't use that one.","Eh, go ahead.",So why do you want this job?,"Well, I love cats, and dogs sure are great.","Well, you have all the qualifications.",You went to a fouryear college.,"Actually, when I went there, it was just a twoyear college.","Wow, so you're not even technically qualified to work at your current job.","Aw, geez.",You're fired.,Get out.,"No, no, you're not fired, but we're definitely going to have to lower your salary.","Oh, well, fair's fair.","I am very, very, very, very frightened of animals.",This may not be the job for you.,"I know, but my therapist, Dr.","Richard Nygard, told me to confront my fears.",You see Dr.,Richard Nygard?,I'm a Nygardian too!,Would you sign my cast?,"Yes, but just please don't give me this job.","The spaying and neutering tools, do you think those fit humans?",Mmmmm.,Mmmmm.,Mmmmm.,And is there a lock on the spaying room door?,Mmmmm.,Mmmmm.,Thank you so much for coming in.,Thanks for having me.,Okay.,"Hello, Orin.","Thank you so much for applying, now leave.","Hey, give him a chance.",What makes you qualified for animal control?,"I studied zoology in college, and I can control animals with my mind.",Get out.,I made you say that.,I liked him.,"Well, that was a truly depressing slate of candidates.",I think you've got several options.,"They're all terrible, but you have them.","Before you begin, a few ground rules.","I need you to explain everything you do before you do it, so I can determine whether I will allow you Oh!",Ugh!,Balsa wood?,You could at least use mahogany.,There's something occluding your ear.,It's sawdust.,Just blow.,Oh.,You've got strep throat.,I'm writing you a prescription for penicillin.,We'll have the rest of your test results in about 20 minutes.,Cholesterol Not interested.,Good day.,Wish all patients were like that.,It's really annoying when they ask questions.,"You know, they claim that smoking is bad for you, but is there any medical evidence to back that up?",Great point.,So the Sweetums Foundation has really accomplished a lot recently.,Our health care outreach program has reduced pink eye in the rural community by 30% to 70%.,Snooze.,You guys ever been fox hunting?,I have my own foxes flown in from Russia.,We drug them pretty heavily so they can't get very far.,"In fact, mostly, they just flop around on the ground.","Makes it easier to just walk up and ""pow!",""" Stupid foxes.",It's deeply erotic.,That sounds amazing.,We should go hunting sometime.,I'd love to.,I could bust out my Ralph Lauren Fall 2010 collection.,Copped it in 2012.,Clearance rack!,"Wear whatever you want, as long as it's not too bright or reflective.","You know, I want you blending in to the surroundings.",How fast can you run?,I think that guy wants to hunt me.,"So, Dennis, not to interrupt Then don't.",Boom!,Ha ha!,Shut him right down!,I have heard so much talking from you.,I don't want to hear your fat mouth say anything else.,Boo!,Oh.,You're a dick.,Excuse me?,Andy  How dare you talk to me like that?,Where are your manners?,"You come to me asking for money, and you treat me like this?",I don't think so.,Wrap it up!,We're done!,Hey!,Show these garbage people out!,"Take the garbage out, Eddie.",Donna?,Gentlemen.,Mr.,"Palletta, what is your occupation currently?","I run a children's break dancing studio called ""D.",J.,Jazzy Vern's.,""" Do you have any experience with animals?","Uh, a bat landed on my face once.","Hey, you know what, he's not a rack of ribs, so stop grilling him.",Nailed it.,"Ribs are better smoked than grilled, so unnailed it, with the back part of the hammer.",How many more questions are there gonna be?,"Jamm said if I got my teeth whitened,  I'd just get the gig.","Uh, ga ga gaho.","Hold up, that's enough.","Thank you, you're done.","You did a heck of a job, Vernie.","Thanks, Jimbo.","Not bad, right?","I mean, if he can catch raccoons as well as he can teach sixyearolds to pop and lock, he's a home run.",That is an insane statement.,"Well, I don't see anyone better.","April, I got a present for you.",I don't like lotion.,I like my hands to be cracked and calloused like a railway worker.,I know.,"I filled the bottles with fake blood, vinegar, and mud.",Really?,Thanks.,"On an unrelated note, do you remember all those candidates we were interviewing for the Animal Control job and how they were all total losers who didn't care about animals?","Except for Jerry, who was great, but who we had to pass on for other reasons.",I was just happy to be considered.,"Anyhoo, I nominated you for the position, and your confirmation hearing is in three minutes.",Surprise.,"No, I don't want the job.",You can have your mud and blood back.,"April, please, you will be so good at it.",You are so good with animals.,"Even if I wanted the job, I don't want to do the stupid confirmation hearing, okay?",Stupid councilmen asking me stupid questions about my stupid life it seems stupid.,"No, it's easythey'll just ask you a few questions.",Let's practice.,What's your name?,Batman.,See?,I failed.,"I will be there to help you, okay?",I will be your Pocahontas.,Climb into my papoose.,Please do this.,"Please, please.",Do it.,Do it.,Do it.,Do it.,You're gonna do it.,Okay.,Yes!,Yay!,But only if you divorce Ben.,"Hey, don't even joke about that.",What?,I really think he's wrong for you.,We now resume the confirmation proceedings for director of the Animal Control Department.,Okay.,"Let's tear this chick a new one, shall we?",Ms.,"Ludgate, we have found many emails showing how you sexually harassed Leslie Knope's assistant.",Andy?,That's my husband.,"They were still extremely graphic, and appreciated by all of us.","I had never heard of several of those terms, and I'm a freak.",Those are personal.,No one's allowed to read those.,You once posted a video of yourself drinking alcohol in City Hall while you were still a minor.,How do you justify that?,Easily.,Alcohol is delicious and fun Damentally a substance that should not be abused.,"I agree, April.",Very good point.,Wow.,Ms.,"Ludgate, are you a ventriloquist?","I mean, that is amazing how you make your words come out of Ms.",Knope's mouth.,Would you like to put her on your knee?,"I mean, that'd be really fun.","Just three years ago, you drove She's not ready.","Now, you've rushed her into this, and now, Jamm's sharpening the knives.","Leslie, no one needs to be jammed today."," Okay, all we need is some kind of distraction.", Grab that gavel and break your other foot.," I like the idea of double the signings, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives.", Don't panic., Maybe she can pull this off.," I guess my first move as director would be to fill your office, house, and car with snakes, and then train a crow to fly up your butt.", Okay! Let's take a brief recess.," Well, well, well.", Look who's back.," Thank you so much for seeing us again, sir.", We just came to apologize., Mr.," Dennis Feinstein, let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, my bad."," I just started working here, and I really want to do a good job, and I blew it.", Thank you for saying that.," Thought about it last night, and I decided that if you came in here and apologized to me like a man, that I would forgive you, and that's what you've done, so you're forgiven."," To that end, here is a check for $25,000 for your charity."," - Oh! - Go out there and help some kids with their pink eye, or whatever it is you guys are doing.", Mr.," Feinstein, thank you.", This is extremely generous.," It's nothing, really.", I'm happy to help.," This check is made out to ""Go [bleep] yourself.",""" In your face! Dennis Feinstein helps no man! Get the hell out of my office! - Hey, what's your problem, man? - Why did you make me - apologize to him? - Guys, guys, just hold it-- hold on a sec, okay? Mr."," Feinstein, with all due respect you are a major dick."," - What? - Run! - Eddie, get my crossbow."," - Crossbow? What the-- You will pay for this! Hey, you look better.", I guess actual medicine can be effective., Who'da thunk? Please leave me alone., Not until we go over your test results and your blood work., Your blood pressure looks fine.," I'm not sure how this is possible, but your cholesterol is 120, which is the lowest I've ever seen."," What's ""cholesterol""? And the only problem I see is that your potassium's low, so just eat a banana once in awhile."," No, thank you."," I live the way I live, I eat the things I eat, and I'll die the way I'll die.", That's oddly beautiful but also stupid.," You're not alone in the world anymore, Ron."," You're dating a woman who has two kids, so every three days, think about Ivy and Zoe and Diane, and eat a damn banana."," I am so sorry, April."," You are doing terribly up there, and it's all my fault."," It's not you, it's me.", - Are you breaking up with me? - I'm breaking up with the idea of you being director of Animal Control., I say we just withdraw your application and let Vern become director., He does have good teeth.," No! All right, I have an idea.", Trust me., Ms.," Ludgate, it is the opinion of this committee that you are terrible.", Can you give me even one reason why you're the right man for this job? No., But neither is your guy., Neither of us should get the job.," Oh, no? Why is that? There shouldn't be a separate Animal Control Department."," Its budget is tiny, and it's ineffective, and frankly, no one could change that.", So I think it should be absorbed into the Parks Department., That is a genius idea., Somebody wake up Milton., History is being made.," Iwo Jima! Animal Control would be way more effective if it ran through the Parks Department, and if you want, I can write up an official report in language simple enough for even you dummies to understand, dummies."," Councilman, you have to admit that that idea makes a lot of sense.", Hang on a second.," You seem to be forgetting that I already told Vern he got the job, and he already bought a new speedboat."," Well, I hope he kept a receipt."," That was a brilliant idea from a dark, tortured genius, and I move that Animal Control be absorbed into Parks and Rec.", I second that.," Yay! Look at that, April.", You won over Jamm.," Uh, no, she didn't.", I'm just sick of being on the losing side., I'm going to tell everyone this was my idea., Retro-jammed., What do we do now? Can I apologize again? I'm getting really at apologizing., Screw that., You should apologize for apologizing to that guy.," God, we really could've used the money, though.", Just wish we'd made a bigger impression.," You did-- I was really impressed by all the stuff the foundation's done for all them poor homies, so you know what? Rent-A-Swag is gonna donate five cents from every dollar we make this month."," It's not Feinstein money, but it'll help."," That's very generous, Tom.", Feinstein's the worst., I hope he gets into an accident driving that Rolex Mobile.," For the last time, it's a Rolexus, and you can't drive it."," April, I have a gift for you.", Ta da.," At Leslie's suggestion, I have made you deputy director of Animal Control within the Parks Department."," You'll be amazing at it, and the best part, there is no confirmation hearing.", How did you make this plaque so quickly? I had it made your first week here.," I knew you'd be going places, so I wanted to be prepared.", - Can I hire an intern? - Not yet., - Can I hire a Mexican elf? - No., - Can I buy a child bride? - No., Then how is this even a promotion? Government shouldn't operate based on personal favors., It should operate based on good ideas.," April had the best idea, and today the best idea won."," Leslie, I really have to go to the bathroom."," Oh, yeah, right, sorry.", You don't have to come in with me., I wasn't going to.," Could you pick up the pace a little bit? Oh, yes, Miss Daisy."," - Night, Ron."," - Night, Ron."," Ladies, ladies.",   ,"

unacceptable level, citizens shall dump Ted into Ramsett Lake.",""" Does anyone object?","As always, I object.","Nay, enough dithering!",Dump the miscreant!,Boo!,"Today is Ted Party Day, where we commemorate the great Pawnee tea dump of 1817.","Historical fun fact when the Founding Fathers wrote the charter, their oldtimey script made one of the ""a""s look like a ""d,"" so ""tea"" became ""Ted.",""" It's just one of those little things that reminds us of Pawnee's rich and vibrant past.","Plus, we get to go find a guy named Ted and throw him in a lake.",One!,I don't even go by Ted!,Two!,I go by Theodore!,Three!,Aah!,"Hey, Ted.",Great job today.,"You were so funny when you were like, ""My cell phone, I left it in my pocket.",""" Then you checked it, remember, and it didn't work.","Yeah, that was hilarious.","Listen, I am just here to say that I am done with Ted Party Day.",Ha!,Classic Ted.,I'm serious.,I'm not getting dumped in that lake anymore.,"And I talked to the other Teds in town, and they're not doing it either.","Come on, Ted Party Day is protected by Article Two in the town charter.","And we have the right, nay, the obligation, to dump Ted into the lake every year.",That's the way it's always been done.,"Okay, first of all, ""That's the way it's always been done"" is not a good reason to keep doing something.","Second, it was a misprint.","They clearly meant ""tea.",""" I just think you need to be careful about speculating what the Founders meant when they were writing the town charter.","Okay, fine.",You want to enforce every single old law we have on our books?,"Hey, can I see your keys for a second?",Here's a quarter.,I own your car now.,Wha  Sorry.,The Pawnee Charter clearly states that any white citizen has the right to seize any Indian property for 25 cents.,That is an outdated and racist law.,"And obviously they meant ""American Indian.",""" Whoa, I think we should be careful when we speculate what the Founders intended when they wrote the charter.","Okay, Ted.",I know what you're doing.,You're quoting me back to me.,But I'm gonna quote me back to you and say that Ted Party Day will never change.,Uhoh.,"You, a woman, just raised your voice to a landowning male.","According to a Pawnee statute passed in 1868, I get to do this.",I was not aware of that statute.,"Ron, you have to help me.",Chris is making me do some stupid management training leadership course.,"Now that you run the Animal Control department, you have qualified for the Chris Traeger Management Training Seminar or ""Katumts.",""" It's not a great acronym, but it is a great seminar.",Can you get me out of it?,Yes.,"Normally, if given a choice between doing something and nothing, I'd choose to do nothing.",But I will do something if it helps someone else do nothing.,I'd work all night if it meant nothing got done.,"Ron Swanson and April Ludgate, literally my two favorite people in the catalogued universe.",April will not be participating in your pointless course because she has more important things to do like not participating in your pointless course.,I just want April to become as great a department head as yourself.,Which is why this is pointless.,"I've been head of the Parks department for 12 years, and I never had any ""management training"" course.","Ron, you've never been ""katumtsed?",""" I am legally required to katumts every department head.","Otherwise, we are open to all kinds of liability.",What are you saying?,"I'm saying that tomorrow during the seminar, April is going to have a classmate.",And spoiler alert  it's Alf.,It's you.,This went poorly.,"What, no.",Damn it!,What are you bidding on?,It better not be Terrence Howard's tank top from Hustle & Flow.,It is not.,Good.,"'Cause I am bidding on it and I am ready to spend an amount that my accountant calls ""Dangerous and irresponsible.",""" JJ's diner put an

buys me something that's awesome and thoughtful, and then I feel terrible.",But that's the thing.,This is the perfect present.,"I just keep getting outbid by someone named ""Tall Tiereeon Lannister.",""" What kind of name is Tiereeon anyway?","You're kidding, right?",Tyrion Lannister?,Lord of Casterly Rock?,The HalfMan?,You don't watch Game of Thrones?,No.,You do?,Hell

the books of many of our town's outdated and obscure laws.","The bill that I have written with the full support of the city council will repeal 110 obsolete laws such as all menstruating women shall be confined to their bathtubs and Article Two, aka, Ted Party Day.",The floor is now open for public comments.,"Oh, here we go.",Thank you.,"My name is Garth Blundin, and I object to your ridiculous proposal.",The Pawnee Charter shall not be changed.,"Not today, not ever!","Wow, a lot of passion, Mr.",Blundin.,Thank you so much.,Your objection is noted and officially in the record.,Shall we proceed to a vote?,No.,"No, we shall not.","Article Seven, Section Three allows for a ""Citizen filibuster.",""" If I stand here and refuse to yield my time, you are prohibited from voting on the bill.","That section defines ""Buffalo meat"" as acceptable currency.",Is that the Buffalo meat one?,Mmhmm.,"I meant Article Three, Section Seven.",Let the filibustering begin.,I would now like to share some ideas I have for J.,J.,Abrams' seventh chapter in the Star Wars' saga.,Pan down from the twin suns of Tatooine.,We are now close on the mouth of the Sarlacc Pit.,"After a beat, the gloved Mandalorian armor gauntlet of Boba Fett grabs onto the sand outside of the Sarlacc Pit and the feared bounty hunter pulls himself from the maw of the sand beast.","Ugh, he's right.",He can do this.,This is exactly why we need to modernize these laws.,This kind of thing made sense when we had council in a barn and there were but now this is nuts.,"If he holds the reality gem, that means he can jump from different realities.",This will be our link to the Marvel Universe from the Star Wars Universe.,Imagine those who were up against Chewbacca 'cause that's gonna happen.,"After a beat, Luke says, ""Darth Vader was my father, but Ben Kenobi was my master.",""" And he cuts Hannibal Lecter in half.",Mr.,"Blundin, look, the laws I'm trying to get rid of have no more relevance in modern society and they're embarrassing to Pawnee.",Repealing them would show that we're changing with the times.,You can't just change the charter willynilly.,"You start by casually repealing a couple of ""old laws,"" the next thing you know, your jackbooted storm troopers are kicking in my door and arresting my wife for no reason if I were married.","By ""jackbooted storm troopers,"" do you mean the Pawnee Police Department?","Hey, Clyde.","Hi, Leslie.",Good Danish today.,"The Pawnee charter is not a ""living document,"" Ms.",Knope.,You have no respect for the traditions of this town.,I absolutely do.,I used to give tours at the Pawnee Historical House.,"Three times, ""Employee Of The Fortnight.",""" Oh, big deal, you put on a costume for a couple hours.","By that logic, every time I go to bed at night, I am Wolverine.",You bought XMen pajamas?,"I won them, madam, in a raffle.","The point is is that our Founding Fathers were brilliant and they were courageous, but they also had wooden teeth and pooped in holes in the ground.",It was a more primitive time.,It was a better time.,You wouldn't have survived two weeks in their day.,"Oh, really?",How about a little wager?,"How about you and I go live in that historical house, no modern technology, If you last longer, I withdraw my bill.","I win, you stop this nonsense.",You have yourself a deal.,"Please write down what you hope to gain from the seminar, seal it in the envelope, and then we'll open it when it's over.",When is this over?,As soon as you learn to embrace the power of positive motivation.,It's a ninehour seminar over two days.,Whoa!,"Oh, good.","All right, let's begin.","Hop on board ""The Management Train.",""" First stop Motivation Station.",All aboard!,Stop bidding on my waffle iron.,You're FutureMrsTigerWoods?,"I made that profile, like, ten years ago.",I don't know how to change it.,The point is I'm getting that waffle iron for Leslie for breakfast day.,"Uh, no, you're not.",I'm getting it for her for waffle day.,"Wait, you have a breakfast day too?",Mine's in June.,"Please, Ben.","This is the celebration of the anniversary of the first time we hung out at JJ's, which she considers the beginning of our friendship.","Well, imagine being married to her.",It's like being smothered with a handquilted pillow filled with cherished memories.,I can't believe I'm complaining about how thoughtful my wife is.,"Sorry, honey.",I love you.,"Look, I have known her for longer, I have five years' worth of anniversaries, so I have seniority.","Oh, God.","Oh, no.",We've lost the auction.,Whatno.,"Somebody swooped in at the last second,  and now we're both screwed.",No.,"Okay, Tyrion Lannister, why don't you just cast a spell and get us the waffle iron back?","Oh, okay.",I don't even have time to tell you how wrong you are.,"Actually, it's gonna bug me if I don't.","The Lannisters, while very wealthy, do not possess the magical abilities of, say, the warlocks of Qarth for example.",This is why we don't hang out.,Think of yourselves as engineers steering a locomotive of positivity that runs on team power.,"First of all, you don't ""steer"" a locomotive.",The tracks do.,"Second, there are only three ways to motivate people money, fear, and hunger.","Oh, I disagree.","What about encouragement, appreciation, and smiles.","When people feel supported, they will literally explode with productivity.",Can you guys just figure out which way is better and tell me so we can leave?,"Thank you for your input, April, but the katumts requires that we follow a very specific syllabus.","You're not being very inclusive, Chris.",I feel like my input isn't being appreciated.,You've killed my spirit.,My spirit blood is on your hands.,"My God, I've taught you so much already.","Ron, I propose a challenge to see whose motivational methods are more effective.",Challenge accepted.,"I don't want to seem overdramatic, but this is literally a battle for April's soul.","I don't want to seem overdramatic, but I don't really care what happens here.","Oh, God.",I hate this place.,Everything is old.,Old things are dumb.,"It's like, just be new.","I don't know, Tom.",I think there's some pretty cool things from back then.,That is a dope bonnet.,"Oh, just getting here, I see.",Yikes.,Did you sleep here last night?,Indeed.,I want to be here when the cock crows to get the chores done.,"Already, I've done the preserves and chased off an interloping cable installer.","Okay, well, let's put all modern devices in this pail.",Nothing can be used that was invented past 1817.,"Andy, Tom, you will be our referees.",Thank you for volunteering.,Definitely didn't volunteer.,I had much better things to do.,Leslie said she'd pay me And I had nothing better to do.,I'm doing it for free.,There's no way I'm losing this contest.,Oldtimey dress?,Check.,Extensive knowledge about early prairie life?,Right here.,Rickets?,Cured.,Don't need to worry about rickets.,Antiperspirant?,Not allowed.,Might get a little rough in there.,I was wondering if you could help me out.,Say no more.,Here's a bunch of guns.,Nope.,Different thing.,I saw that you recently won an auction for the JJ's diner waffle iron.,And I'd like to that's it right there.,I'd like to buy it.,You and everyone else.,"Hello, Ben.",Seems like I love Leslie more than you do.,Get in line.,Yeah.,"Get in line, pal.",Who are you?,I'm Roz.,"I'm Leslie's mailwoman, and I need to get her a Mail Day present by next Wednesday.",It's the anniversary of the first Time you delivered her mail.,"Yeah, we get it.",Looks like we've got ourselves an oldfashioned pawnshop waffle iron bidding war.,"Let's start the bidding at $650,000.","Okay, I'll counter with 100 bucks.",I'll let you take anything  out of this bag.,"I'll tell you what, Ann.",I'll give it to you if you go  on a date with me.,"Oh, God.","I can't believe I'm about to do this, but fine.",One date.,But let me make one thing perfectly clear  500 bucks.,Sold.,What?,You still want to go out?,I just come into some money.,$500 buys a lot of nitrous.,"Yeah, nothing warms the blood like an old whirlybout with the old buttergyre,  eh, Leslie?",Indeed.,"Man, this guy's tougher than I thought.",I don't know how either of you guys are doing this.,"One time my refrigerator stopped working, I didn't know what to do.",I just moved.,I just don't think he's ever gonna quit.,He has that look in his eye that Ben gets when he plays Risk.,"Oh, wow.",That is really good.,Andy.,"No, I'm sorry.",This tastes great.,All my favorite foods have butter on 'em.,"Pancakes, toast, popcorn, grapes.",Butter is my favorite food.,"Well, then you're gonna love what I'm churning up.","Take a look at Oh, my God.",This is horrifying.,Nobody eat that.,I think I'm in over my head.,Garth really knows his stuff.,He planted an entire field of barley.,How long is he planning on staying here?,"Hey, um, aren't we husband and wife in this scenario?","I mean, like, shouldn't you  Not a chance.",Okay.,"Wait, what's that?",Do you guys feel that?,Aah!,How long was that under there?,"Man, Garth is a machine.",He brought his own whale blubber to light the lamps.,I thought he was gonna last an hour max.,It's like he's getting stronger the longer he stays here.,Whee!,"Look at my hoop, Leslie.",Look at my hoop!,Ugh!,Who could live like this?,No one.,That's why we've moved on.,"It's fun to be here on, like, a school field trip or something.","It's so, so, so fun.","So, so fun.",But to live like this is insane.,He must have cheated somehow.,"I mean, there's no way a man who's into XMen that much can stay away from the Internet that long.",We should check his phone.,"Goodness, how delicious  eating goober peas Jerry Gergich.",I need you to stop whatever it is you're doing and file as many of these as you can.,"Wow, Duraflex cuttop A350s in deep maroon?",The honor is all mine.,"Well, I knew you were the man for the job.",You are smart and capable.,And I believe you can accomplish anything.,Thank you so much.,"You got it, champ.",Get filing.,"Aye, aye, Captain.",That is one motivated worker bee.,You guys doing experiments on Jerry?,Yes.,Cool.,Got it.,"Okay, now let's not read anything.",That's an invasion of his privacy.,Let's just look at his browser history and his inbox and his outbox and his Facebook page.,"Yeah, he doesn't have any new emails.","Oh, my God.",It's true.,He hasn't gotten an email in Is he a ghost?,The only ones he gets are spam.,And he responds to them.,I think I'm gonna be sick.,"Oh, man.",This guy has no friends.,I don't know.,Seems like he's friends with that mule.,What's that?,"Well, since I can't give her a waffle iron for breakfast day, I am making her a miniature Leslie  out of breakfast food.",Good lord.,"Well, listen, I've been thinking.",How would you feel about going in  on the waffle iron together?,Seriously?,"That would be great, but whose holiday are we celebrating?","Well, I think I may have a plan that'll get us out of breakfast day and waffle day and all the other days without making us seem like ungrateful people who are annoyed at how amazing Leslie is.","Dude, whatever it is, I'm in.","Okay, great.",What should I do with this?,Just burn it and bury the ashes and pray it doesn't haunt you.,"Jerry, stop filing those red folders at once.",Begin filing these blue ones.,Oh.,"Sorry, Ron.",I promised Chris that This is the top priority.,I need these blue folders done now.,You can eat when you have finished.,File!,"Oh, my goodness.","Money, fear, hunger.","Hey, there, Garth.",Whatcha whittling?,A birthing stick.,What's that?,You do not want to know.,"Oh, my God.",You look beautiful.,"I mean, you changed clothes.",Violation.,II challenge  you are bonnetless!,"Yes, you're right.","I admit, I can't take it anymore.",You win.,Huzzah!,The day is mine.,"I'm gonna miss saying ""huzzah.",""" - Yeah."," Garth, I have another proposition."," Yes, I will go out on a date with you, but I realize you're a modern woman, so I will let you pay.", No., I was wondering would you like to join the Pawnee Historical Commission? Those clowns? No thank you.," They haven't answered a single one of my complaints about their anachronistic use Well, I'm a member, and I think we could really use you."," But the only problem is there's tons of meetings, lots of work with people who also love history, and many social occasions that you're gonna have to attend, like cocktail parties and such.", I can understand if it's something you don't want to commit to., Just sounds like such a big bite out of my soap-making time., My cousin's arraignment is in May., But that's a day.," I just fly out, I come back the same day."," On a trial basis, yes."," Yes, yes.", Great., Welcome to the team.," Garth dropped his protest, and we were able to get rid of all the outdated laws in the town charter."," I mean, the charter is a wonderful document, but we've had the benefit of almost 200 years of learning and advancing.", Seems to me we ought to use it.," I did not change Article Two, though."," I just couldn't vote against a good, old-fashioned lake dunking.", Though Garth and I did come up with a compromise that I think will make everybody happy.," From this year hence, a volunteer will represent Ted in our town's most historic and cherished tradition."," This year, the honor goes to Mr."," Garth Blundin! Huzzah, I'm Ted! I'm Ted! I'm Ted too, guys."," - Andy! - Yeah! He's naked, everybody! Put that away! - We're all Ted! Yeah! - No, Andy! Whoo! Thank God.", I don't know how to swim.," Okay, final tally.", - Jerry filed 268 red files., - Yes! And 384 blue files., - Yes., - Wait a minute.," How is that possible? Well, he was so happy when you told him he was doing a great job that he spent 20 minutes on the phone telling Gayle about it.", - And the prosecution rests., - Not so fast.," He may have filed more blue ones, but they're almost all filed wrong.", Not surprising since he was a mess after you talked to him.," Another fascinating edition of ""ka-tumts.",""" We may never know conclusively which way works better."," But I do know this-- When we first started the seminar, I hoped to be able to engage you in the process.", And by that measure I succeeded., And I predicted that I would learn nothing from this process., Mission accomplished.," What did April write? Where is April? ""I will pit Ron and Chris against each other."," They'll argue about dumb stuff that doesn't matter, and I will bail.", Then I'll steal $20 from Chris's wallet and buy pizza with Andy.," Oh, and I'll also steal Ron's watch, just for fun.", I think April will be a fine manager., I agree.," It's my favorite kind of battle-- Two men enter, one me leaves.", - Happy waffle day., - Happy breakfast day.," Oh, my God! You guys, this is the best Breakfast Day/Waffle Day joint present I have ever received.", Wow., Thank you so much., You're welcome., But Ann and I wanted to tell you that this is the last Breakfast Day and Waffle Day we'll be celebrating.," Wait, what? Oh, my God.", You're both dying.," No, no.", We just can't keep up with all the anniversaries.," It's too much, especially 'cause you're so good at them.", I'm no better at them than you are.," That's ridiculous, I'm so much better.", Point taken., But we have a compromise.," Every year, there will be one day, ""Ann Day,"" where you can celebrate all of Ann's holidays and ""Ben Day"" where we can celebrate all of ours.", What about Ann Month and Ben Month? How about a week? Fine.," We went in with a day, figuring she'd counter with a month.", We were fine with a week., - Yeah., - Yeah., But there will be a third week., It will be called Friend Week.," It will be commemorating this week, the week that my two best friends became each other's best friends.", I have a Friend Week present for you right now., Here you go., How did you already have these? - Thank you., - Thanks.,   ,"
                ",Season: 5 Episode: 20,Hey.,"I didn't find the article about you teaching sexed to seniors, but I did find this folder labeled  ""Senior sexed thank you notes.","""  Oh, don't open that.",There's pictures in there.,Oh!,There are pictures.,There are lots of pictures.,Why would you not throw these away or incinerate them?,Because every memory deserves to be chronicled.,Even the saggy ones.,I am putting together a scrapbook commemorating my first year on the city council.,This year whizzed by so fast.,There was so much more I wanted to do.,But time is the relentless and cruel enemy of the devoted civil servant.,It's actually one of the subtitles of my scrapbook.,Probably would've got more stuff done if I hadn't spent so much time brainstorming scrapbook titles.,Ben and Leslie's day off.,Let's go relax.,I cannot wait for our day off.,But what if we took a day on and stayed here and worked on some projects?,"That sounds pretty sexy, right?",No.,"Leslie, you've worked nonstop.",Holidays and weekends.,You're just gonna take a day off.,It'll be good for you.,All right.,You're cute.,And you're right.,Come on.,Let's relax.,All right.,"Hey, April.","I'll be gone for the next 19 1/2 hours, so can you water my plants in my office?","We are all out of water, actually.",I'll have to use boiling hot milk.,Are you really gonna do that?,Yes.,"Well, everybody.","Um, wow.",It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with you all.,The time I have spent at Parks and Rec have been the happiest days of my life here in the government.,"And I know everyone says it, but I sincerely hope that we stay in touch.",What the [Bleep] is happening right now?,"Today's my last day, Leslie.",I'm retiring.,What?,Why didn't you tell us?,"Well, I didn't want to make a big fuss.","Although, gosh, I'm pretty sure I mentioned it a few times.","Oh, God, they're gonna fire people, aren't they?","Yeah, I am two years from my pension.",Can you believe it?,Only six months left until I retire.,Ooh.,What did Jerry say?,Jerry was here?,"Well, this is my last weep.",Oops.,"I mean, ""weep.",""" Week.",Jeez.,"Wait, wait, wait.","Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.",Just wait.,Everybody wait.,Okay.,"As much as we want this to happen, we can't let Jerry just disappear.",We have to commemorate this somehow.,You're right.,"Jerry, thank you for your service.",Goodbye.,"Thanks, Ron.",That speech means a lot.,"Okay, well, I am going to go and say goodbye to some other folks.","Okay, see you tomorrow, Jerry.","So we ran all your tests, and everything looks great.",You might be the healthiest human being we've ever seen.,You have the resting heart rate of a 100yearold tortoise.,"Yes, I get that a lot.",So my childhood illness there's no chance I would pass that on?,"It wasn't genetic, so you shouldn't worry at all.",You have every reason to expect a healthy child.,"In fact, if you'd like, you can provide your sample today.",Today?,"Like, today, today?",This today?,"Well, yes.","I mean, the timing is right according to Ann's ovulation schedule.",Unless there's a reason you'd like to wait till next month.,No.,None.,One other question.,Completely off topic.,Would I be providing this sample today?,"Here I am thinking about how fast my first year in city council has gone, and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past him with nothing to show for it.","This is everything in his file a handicapped parking sticker from when he got gout, a Parks and Rec golf cart driving exam which he failed, a scathing performance review.","I mean, why would anyone be so mean?","Oh, wait.",I wrote this.,I stand by it.,"Well, Jerry was never really the type to rise above mediocrity or to it.","That's what I thought, but when he started, he had a lot of dreams and goals.","I mean, look at his original entry paperwork.","He wanted to meet the mayor, have a building named after him.",I just can't let Jerry leave here with nothing and go home to an empty life.,"Well, I'll help with anything.",Just promise we'll do it quickly.,I'm making us a mac and cheese pizza for  Mac and cheese pizza?,Yeah.,You're making that?,Yeah.,Torturing Jerry was my favorite thing in the world.,After making out with you.,Remember when we did both at the same time?,It made him so uncomfortable.,This is a sad day.,Who are we gonna make fun of now?,No need to worry.,"Every place I've ever worked in has had a ""Jerry.",""" When one Jerry leaves, the office naturally selects a new Jerry to fill that role.",It's Social Darwinism.,The strong prey on the weak.,"Soon, one of you will be ridiculed mercilessly.","Ah, nature.",Okay.,My transfer was approved.,"So starting now, I am an employee of the County Health Board.","You are no longer my boss, and we can have a baby without being a conflict of interest.",Clear sailing.,"Goodbye, Ann Perkins, my excellent employee.","Hello, Ann Perkins, my fallopian princess.",So here's the drill.,Make a deposit in here.,"If you fill it up all the way, you get on the board.","Then we take the sample, spin it in the centrifuge, and prepare it for fertilization.",Sounds romantic.,I guess it's go time.,Go time!,"Wait, what am I doing?",I don't go with you.,"Oh, no, no.",I go in alone with this pornographic disc and do it myself.,And you stay out here and try not to think about what I'm doing in there.,And I try not to think about you waiting out here trying not to think about me.,Should I think about you?,This is so weird.,"Chris, we don't have to do this today.",This was totally just sprung on us.,Let's just take a moment.,There's so many pamphlets to look at.,"Yes, we do have very important pamphlet reading to do.","Excellent idea, Ann Perkins.",Do I keep this?,I don't know.,It feels wrong to leave it here.,Give it to me.,I panicked.,Run!,Here are the last of the Animal Control reports.,"What are you doing, weirdo?",Just trying not to spill anything.,I believe Leslie said to organize these by year.,Way ahead of you.,I made two pile files.,Pilo fibles.,Ugh.,Filo pilos.,Filo pilos?,That's not right.,Are you broken?,"No, everything's fine.","Well, I guess that settles who the new Jerry is.","No, it doesn't!",I barely even said it wrong.,Said it wrong.,Stop it!,This is how it begins.,"The next ""Jerry.",""" One screwedup sentence, and 30 years later, I'm wearing aquamarine sweater vests and listening to Bonnie Raitt and The da Vinci Code on my iPod.",It's already started.,"Believe it or not, Jerry, you were young once.",Young and full of dreams.,I forgot I wrote all this.,"And as unrealistic and absurd as those goals were, we are not letting you retire until we help you achieve them.",So let's see what's first.,"""Eat in city council private dining room.",""" That we can achieve.",Right now?,Sure.,Let's go.,Authorized personnel only.,"Oh, they're with me.","City Councilor Leslie Knope, clearance level four.",Guests are only allowed on Wednesdays.,And we don't have clearance levels.,"I know, but shouldn't we?","I mean, it sounds so cool.","Anyway, we just need to get in there real quick and maybe take a picture.","He's retiring as a city hall employee after 41 years, and it was his dream to eat here.",His dream?,Really?,Still no.,"It's okay, Leslie.",Come on.,But thank you.,Thank you for trying.,"No, no, no, no, no.",I promised you an executive meal and you're gonna get one.,"Ben, justokay.",I'm gonna go in there and take a picture with Jerry.,I put my arm around nothing.,"And then you Photoshop him in later, okay?",Congratulations on your retirement.,"Aw, thank you.","One, three, seven, two, five, nine.",Pffft!,Sudoku is easy.,Is there even rules to this game?,"There's a natural successor to Jerry's sad, smelly crown.",And it's not me.,It's Andy.,Big guy?,Check.,Goofy?,Check.,"All I have to do is wait for a textbook Dwyer screwup, which usually happens, mm, every 20 minutes.","Hey, if it isn't Filo Pilo.","Oh, real creative, Donna.",You expect that to catch on?,"Babe, the pen.",Look at Andy.,There's ink all over him.,Andy's the new Jerry.,Game over.,Awesome.,"Hey, I'm like a giant squid.","Hey, honey, I'm ink Dracula.","No, stop.",Squid Dracula is going to get you.,"Barking up the wrong tree, Filo.",What do you mean?,Andy will never be the new Jerry.,Nothing embarrasses him.,He's like a giant puppy with no shame.,What you need is some fresh meat in the office.,Or you guys could just stop making fun of me.,Yeah.,No.,"Okay, on to the next Jerry goal meet Mayor Knudson.","Oh, yeah.",He was the mayor at the time.,I've always wanted to meet him.,"Well, today you're getting that chance.",So was he like  a really great mayor?,"No, not really.","He resigned because of corruption and racketeering, and then he died from an overdose of pills.",But actually his real cause of death was being thrown out of a helicopter while handcuffed.,"Some people say he's still alive because they never found the body, but they never found the body because he exploded on impact.",Sounds like a good dude.,Yeah.,"I just wish I had a chance to meet him, you know, years ago before all the scandals and his death.",But this is nice too.,Yeah.,Is it?,Yes.,Mmhmm.,It is.,"Okay, go over there.",Let's meet Mayor Knudson.,I'll take your picture.,Butterflies.,"Hello, Mr.",Mayor.,"First of all, I'm so sorry that those Serbian mobsters shoved you out of that helicopter.",You deserve better.,"Okay, you tried, but I took a day off to spend with you, not with you and Jerry and a dead mayor.",Can we please just call it a day?,"No, we can't because in a few short years, we're gonna be visiting Jerry here, and he will have achieved nothing.",Is that what you want?,No.,"Okay, then.",It's really been nice to meet you.,"Okay, Jerry, let's go.",Ooh.,Ronfire of the vanities.,Filo Pilo.,Are you kidding me?,"Listen, now that Jerry's gone, we need to hire someone to pick up the slack.",A new person in the office?,Not a person.,An intern.,Why on earth would I get an intern?,Interns cost nothing to the taxpayer.,"And more importantly, they're usually stupid and terrible.",So they get no work done.,It's like a Jerry you don't have to pay.,"Damn, son.",That is one compelling argument.,"Keep it up, Filo.",We may destroy this government one day after all.,These pamphlets are fascinating.,"It says here that some men gain ""sympathy weight"" when their partners get pregnant.","If that happens to me, I'd be miserable.",But happy.,But sad.,I would have never imagined the babymaking process to be this clinical.,"I mean, imagine if actual sex were like this.",Let me remove my clothes so we may begin to engage in physical activity to multiply our genes.,And it's also weird because we dated and we remember what it's like to engage in some of those  physical activities.,Exactly.,And we were also pretty good at those physical activities.,"Yes, we were.","Yes, we were.","You know, is this all the pamphlets?",'Cause I think that maybe I have some left in my bedroom.,"Oh, well, then, we should definitely go look for those.",Let's find those.,We need to find those.,Hurry.,"Okay, everyone gather around.","Leslie, I really appreciate this, but I did promise Gayle I would leave by 5:00.","She has a tasty surprise waiting for me, if you know what I mean.","Gross, Jerry.",She made a meatloaf.,"Well, this is better than meatloaf.","When Jerry first applied for this job, one of this goals was to have a building named after him.","Again, that is an absurd request considering your work record.",But I thought maybe he could have a room named after him.,"So henceforth, Parks and Rec conference room will serve as a testament to your years of public service.","Oh, my God.","Hear, hear.","""Jerry Gergich Memorial Conference Room.",R.,I.,P.,"""?","Oh, the guy at the plaque store thought you had died.","It was a rush job, so we didn't have time to change it.",It doesn't matter.,We can just pretend it means retire in peace.,Yeah.,"Yeah, okay.",So bring out the cake!,Oh.,"Speech, speech, speech.","Well, thank you, guys.","I'm not much of a speechmaker, but I do like good cake.",Delicious.,"Uh, you're on fire.",Oh!,"Oh, my God, Jerry!",Whoa.,"Well, that went roughly as well as I thought it would.",I promised Gayle I'd leave at 5:00.,I guess this is it.,Bye.,"See you tomorrow, Jeremy.","Well, pretty heroic, huh, guys?",Hard to make fun of that.,"Oh, man, the cake.",Filo Pilo ruined the cake.,Classic Pilo.,What how is that my fault?,Stupid Jerry.,Should have never saved his life.,"Hey, Jerry.",Do you have a second?,Leslie.,"Well, this is a lovely surprise.",Come on in.,Have breakfast with the family.,That's okay.,I just popped by to apologize and to give you something.,Is that Leslie Knope?,Yes.,"Oh, hi, Gayle.",What a surprise.,I insist you join us for breakfast.,This guy is the greatest breakfast chef in the world.,"You know, I'm not really into breakfast foods.",Really?,Your purse is shaped like a waffle.,Is it?,Please join us.,The Gergiches don't take no for an answer.,Mmmm.,"Ugh, okay.",Come on in.,"Girls, we've got company.","So, you want to get out of here?","Work just started, Ms.",Meagle.,"Yeah, but our work is just beginning.",You know what I'm saying?,"Oh, Donna, who's the new boy toy?","I'm Taylor, the new intern.",This is the new intern?,Are you kidding me?,"Yeah, he went to high school with my sister, Natalie.",He was a big deal on the football team.,"Oh, meathead jock type, huh?","Actually, I quit football senior year so I could help my pastor run a homeless shelter.",Oh.,Pfftt!,"This guy loves the homeless so much, he should marry them, right?",Anybody would be lucky to marry him.,"Hey, Taylor, do you want to marry me and April?","Wish I could, man, but I'm not a ""marriage"" dude.","I've got a lot of love to give, and it just seems unfair to put boundaries on it.",He gets it.,You so get it.,"Oh, hey.",Hi.,Should I keep walking towards you?,"Yeah, I could stop, and you could walk.","Or you know what, we could meet in the middle.",Great plan.,Hello.,Hi.,Welp.,Okay.,"Ron, ask me if I'm sad.",No.,"Ron, I'm the new Jerry.","Well, is whining going to do anything about it?",You don't want to be a whipping boy.,Stand up for yourself.,"You don't understand, Ron.",I already was Jerry.,"I was a skinny Indian kid in South Carolina, and it sucked.","It took me 12 years, but I reinvented myself.",I'm a business owner.,I wear dope suits.,I have fur underwear.,It was all for nothing.,I'm back to being a Jerry.,All right.,I gotta buy some sweat pants and a Nicholas Sparks novel.,Might as well lean into it.,Tom can take care of himself.,He's a grown man.,"Well, halfgrown.",He does have a business where he rents out his clothes to 12yearolds.,"Eggs, bacon, and toast  eggs, bacon, and toast  why don't you start your day   the Gergich way with eggs, bacon, and  Oh, me?","ttoast  eggs, bacon, and toast  eggs, bacon, and toast  why don't you start your day   the Gergich way with  eggs, bacon, and  Toast Very good.",We sing that every morning.,But it's an extra treat because you're here to sing it with us.,"Thanks, guys.","Jerry, I wanted your last day at work to be special, and I feel like I let you down.", No! So I made you this scrapbook with nearly 4 amazing pages jam-packed with memories of your time in the government.," Oh, my go-- well, look."," Oh, honey.", You look great in every one of these., You are still the most handsome man in the world to me., Ugh.," Mom, come on."," Yeah, jeez, mom.", We're eating.," You know, it doesn't make any sense."," Leslie, that is really sweet of you, but you don't have to worry about me.", I'm great., Here., I want to show you something., Okay.," No! You also dropped that, clumsy."," Where am I? I know I didn't achieve all my work goals, but, Leslie, I don't care because for me, the best part about working in the Parks department was that I got to be home every night with my family at 5:00."," And to me, that's what mattered most."," Little Sebastian Oh, wow.", Jerry., Thank you for sharing this with me., I-- You have a wonderful life., Mmhmm., Aw., Group hug.," Uhoh, here they are.", The hug machine is here., The hug machine-- it's firing on all cylinders.," Okay, I think we should be adults and talk about this.", I would love to.," I was nervous after yesterday because I was thinking what does this mean for us? Not as parents, but as Chris and Ann? I don't think on-again, off-again is a great parental model."," Well, I completely agree."," But if there is a hypothetical chance that we could provide a home with two parents who are hypothetically together, then that could be even better hypothetically.", Of course., We should discuss and consider all the possibilities., The most important thing for me and I think for you is that we have a child., And I don't want to do anything to jeopardize that., Do you want to make out? I really do., Hey.," What are you doing here, Jerry? I thought you were fired.", I wasn't fired., I retired., That's what they all say., I asked Jerry to come in.," That new intern wasn't working out, so I got rid of him."," Once again, I object in the strongest possible terms."," Once again, noted.", I have also asked Jerry to come in a couple hours a week until we find a permanent replacement.," Ugh, just when we were rid of him? Yeah, I don't know, Ron."," Are you hearing me, son? Jerry will come in once a week, and everyone will get to watch him eat and talk to him about anything he might do or say or fart."," - Welcome back, Jerry.", - Thank you.," Oh, it feels good just to be ba-- Classic new guy.", I'm sorry that I spent your day off with Jerry - instead of relaxing with you., - It's all right.," And after you fell asleep making Jerry's scrapbook, I went back to season one of Fringe to check for plot holes.", As I suspected--airtight., I'm sorry., This is all my fault., I love my job.," But in the blink of an eye, I'm gonna be retiring, you know, and flying off on Marine One with you and a Secret Service detail."," Achievements are great, but I want more than that.", I want what Jerry has.," I mean, we're always gonna work, but I think we need to fill this scrapbook too.", Maybe we should take a real day off and talk about starting our family., Yeah., That sounds perfect.," Hey, while you were over at Jerry's, did you happen to get any information about his history with Gayle? Like, was she a Russian spy and the KGB forced her to marry Jerry as a cover? You know, it's a mystery, Ben.", Let it go.," Yeah, I can't.", It keeps me awake at night.," Hey, maybe Gayle has one of those Oliver Sacks brain disorder thingies? Like, does she think Jerry is a friendly hat? I think you solved it.",   ,"
                ",Season: 5 Episode: 21,Hey!,What the hell is this?,I'm guessing it's my latest budget cut proposal based on your rage sweat.,"First of all, I am rage glowing.","Second, you wanna cut funding for the Pawnee Palms Public PuttPutt?",What did the P.,P.,P.,P.,P.,ever do to you?,"Ron is very antigovernment, and he has that philosophy, but there are just certain things that you don't cut.","Schools, police, minigolf, merrygorounds, parades, gazebo repair, roads and bridges, whatever.","Pretty gardens, hummingbird feeders.",I believe in cutting useless government projects.,"I also believe in cutting useful projects, future projects, and past projects.",The Hoover Dam is a travesty.,You also believe in making furniture.,Why don't you go solder a chair instead?,Do you expect me to make a chair out of transistor chips and small wires?,"Look, the defunding of the minigolf course is on the agenda for the city council meeting tomorrow.",I'm sure you'll argue against it with your trademark vigor.,"Oh, I will argue, and I'm gonna win.","That puttputt is gonna be around forever, and when I am done with it, it'll attract more visitors than the Hoover Dam.",And it'll produce double the amount of electricity.,How?,I'll figure it out.,It already has windmills.,Who cares?,"Councilmen, I have something to discuss with you, but before I do, can I just point out how handsome the both of you look today?","Yeah, I know.",I feel very ill.,"Okay, well, tomorrow we are voting on funding for the minigolf course, and personally, I think it is great for families, it's a great job creator, and it's extremely cute.",I'm wondering which way you two are leaning.,"Well, the last time I was there, I saw kids of all races getting along and playing.",It was terrible.,So I'm voting to get rid of it.,At least you have a good reason.,"Well, Howser is with me.",Milton is with Dexhart.,"Jeremy, you're the swing vote.",What do you think?,Hmm.,"Well, on the one hand, I love cutting government programs.","On the other hand, minigolf rules.","And on the third hand, I hate both you and Ron Swanson.",So this one could go either way.,I'm kind of a badass wild card.,"Hey, what are you doing tonight?",More like who am I doing?,No one.,I'm free.,What's up?,"Can I get two beers and an ice water for my friend here, designated driver?",I am?,You drove here.,"Nah, it's too late, bro.",I already ordered the water.,I don't know what you want me to do.,"Andy and I just closed a big donation to the Redwood Music Program, a charity he discovered, so I suggested we all go out for a celebratory drink.",And somehow I just ended up becoming the designated driver.,And paying for everyone.,And I didn't get to choose the bar.,I should be more assertive.,"Aw, the band is moving me tonight.",It's really good.,Really?,They sound kinda crappy to me.,"Kinda sounds like one of your songs, babe.","Well, you know what, Mouse Rat has a lot of influence on some of the local high school bands, mostly 'cause Chang buys 'em beer and whatnot.","Wait, Andy, this is a Mouse Rat song.","Spread your wings and fly, yeah  That's my band.",I didn't recognize us without me because I'm the only one that matters.,"Thank you, everyone.",We are Rat Mouse.,Rat Mouse?,Rat bastards.,They're playing without me?,That's a song I wrote!,"Hey, baby, can I borrow your car for a month?",I already lent you my car.,Do you not know where my car is?,"Ugh, I'm so sick of the third degree.",It's like dating a cop.,I'm gassy.,Let's make out.,What?,Yeah.,Move aside!,Dating MonaLisa is awesome.,Except that I live in constant fear for my life.,So I guess it's time to do the mature thing and have someone else dump her for me.,"Uh, Perkins, sit down.",I just heard that you and Traeger might be getting back together.,"Yeah, it's funny, right?","I mean, we're already planning on having a baby together.",We're not quite a couple but Yeah.,Cool.,Congrats.,"Listen, I need your help.",My girlfriend is crazy.,You say that about every girl you date.,You said that about me.,"Calm down, Ann.",You're proving my point.,"Seriously, MonaLisa is legit insane.",She once jumped out of a moving car to buy a Nicki Minaj poster.,Can you break up with her for me?,I'm not gonna dump a girl for you.,I'll give you that chenille blanket of mine  you love so much.,Deal.,"Ugh, but that's my favorite blankie.",Won't you do it for free?,Nope.,Fine.,"Yeah, dead ringer for Courtney ThorneSmith.",She works at the gas station.,"Okay, I need to have Jamm fall in love with this place, so I'm rolling out the red carpet.",I need you to stay upbeat.,Keep things light.,Absolutely.,I can be a sort of Conversational lubricant.,"Yeah, there's probably a less gross way to say it, but sure.",I love being a caddy.,It's so much more than just carrying clubs.,It's about offering positive reinforcement.,I consider myself a caddy to everyone in my life.,"Yeah, good one!",Nice shot!,Great sweeping.,"Way to be, duck.","Councilman, nice putter.","Oh, thank you very much.",Some fat Hawaiian guy left it in my waiting room.,"When he came back, I was all like, ""Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, no, I haven't seen it.",I don't know.,""" Classic.",What a great and funny story.,"Okay, before we start, anybody want a hot dog?",Hot dogs?,"You know I have irritable bowel syndrome, you racist.","Yikes, okay.",How about a snow cone on me?,"Hello, Councilman.","Chris, Leslie, snow cone lady.",I see you're about to play a round of publicly subsidized minigolf.,Mind if I join you?,"Well, hello, Burly, Chang.","Hey, man, what's up?","I was just over at the bar, enjoying a wonderful night with my coworkers who all talked about how awesome I was, and I look up, and what do I see?",A band.,"But you're missing something like, uh, I don't know, your lead singer/songwriter/ Tshirt designer/nacho chef.",What's up?,"First of all, your nachos are terrible.",No one's had the guts to tell you.,Why don't you melt the cheese?,"We tried to tell you about the show, man.","I called your cell, like, 20 times.","Well, I dropped my cell phone in a bowl of cereal last week, you idiot.","You bothered to call me, you'd have known that.",Maybe you should change your name to Burly and The Backstabbers.,"That's a pretty good name, actually.","Yeah, he's really good at coming up with names.",Get me a Budweiser Black Crown.,You guys got Black Crown here?,"If not, you should.","Ron, are you gonna be joining us?",I won't be playing.,I'm simply here to remind Councilman Jamm that this ridiculous play palace costs the taxpayers thousands of dollars a year.,And what a bargain.,"I mean, kids love it, adults love it, Jamm loves it.",Everybody loves it.,It's like the Toy Story 3 of places.,"Yeah, she's right, Swanson.",I do love it.,You should relax a little.,Have a snow cone.,Leslie's buying all night.,You don't say.,"She's buying you snow cones, and tomorrow you're voting on an issue that she cares about.","Hey, guys, what, are we gonna stand around all day and listen to Ron spout off unrelated facts about blah, blah, blah, or are we gonna play?",Game on.,"Hey, everybody, great news.",They gave us free mylar balloons.,I got dibs on the dinosaur.,And the pirate and the dolphin.,I want all of 'em.,You got 'em.,Sweet.,The Councilman is away Good luck to you both.,"Luck has nothing to do with it, Chris.","Yeah, I could be a pro!","Wow, you are on fire, Jeremy.",Having fun?,Mmhmm.,I think this proves that this is a wonderful place that brings joy to people's lives and brings a community together.,"It's also a place that costs the taxpayer $9,000 in annual subsidies.",You guys sound like school.,I have two important pieces of caddy information.,"Councilman Jamm leads by eight strokes, and you are both about to set a course record.",For friendship.,On to the next hole.,You are pandering to get a vote.,"And worse, you're deliberately losing.",I am not deliberately losing.,I'm having a very off night.,Losing on purpose is a form of lying.,You're only as good as your word.,"You want a word, Ron?",I have a word for you.,"I will do anything I can to get Jamm's vote so that he will keep this course open, and it will be good for the community stop!",I know it's more than one word.,Shut up.,"Remember Hi, MonaLisa?",Hi.,I'm Ann Perkins.,I used to date Tom.,"Oh, okay.","We can do this, but I will bite you.","Is that a screwdrive no, I do not want to fight.",No.,Okay.,I just wanna talk to you womantowoman because I know Tom pretty well.,Do you know his ATM pin?,'Cause I cannot crack that little bitch's code.,I don't.,You know what used to drive me nuts?,He is a total control freak.,"I mean, you have to put a coaster down on every surface, and the worst part is, they're all made out of pictures from Diddy's Instagram.",Diddy's on Instagram?,"How did I not know that Diddy was on Instagram, you jagweeds?",Who are you yelling at?,The jagweeds.,Why are you still in front of me?,Everything that used to  I'm done with that band.,"I mean, I'm an adult now, you know?",I work two parttime jobs.,Hello.,I don't need the stress of playing guitar with my friends every few weeks.,"Yeah, plus look how bad they are without you.",Burly's terrible.,He actually has a really beautiful voice for a backup singer.,"Right, that's what I meant.","I love Andy, but to be perfectly honest, Mouse Rat's music is not my thing.","I really only listen to, like, German Death Reggae and Halloween sound effects records from the 1950s.",And Bette Midler.,Obviously.,"You know what, I'm retiring from music.",Andy.,Andy.,Done.,"But not without first a monster farewell performance solo on this stage tonight, everybody.",I'ma show these idiots what a big mistake they made.,"I need piece of paper, I need a pen, I need four more beers, I need a computer fan, I need a lightning bolt of inspiration.",It's song writing time.,What do you need a computer fan for?,"Sometimes when you use a computer, it gets hot, and the fan cools it down.","You know, I think it's great that you're cool with Tom's financial situation.",What are you talking about?,Tommy owns his own business.,"Yeah, but he had to borrow a lot of money, and when you're not around, Tom drinks tap water.",What?,Excuse me.,You're broke?,"Uh, yeah, super broke.",Are you upset about that?,"Mm, yeah, 'cause I don't eff with poorsies.","But thanks to a warning from my new best friend, I don't have to, okay?","We're done, you're awesome, and I don't even usually like Puerto Rican chicks.","I'm notI mean, it shouldn't matter, but I'm You're breaking up with me?","Oh, man, that sucks.",That's right.,It's over.,Let's go dance.,Help.,"Ugh, I cannot catch a break.","You better find your stroke, Knope.","Guys, I'm gonna let Julie go home.","It's getting late, and Jeremy's eaten all the syrup.",Thank you.,It's been an honor working alongside you.,Thanks.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.",Hold up.,Snow cones are half the fun.,"Yeah, Julie, could you stay, please?",I have calculus homework.,"I Oh, well, math is worthless in real life.","I mean, there's an app for calculating tips.",That's all you need.,"Math is very important, especially for young women.",Stay in school.,I've made my point.,Leslie has made hers.,"Which way are you voting, Councilman?","Uh, well, I'm kind of still on the fence about this budget thing, but I do love watching you guys squabble over me.",You sure make a guy feel like a real lady.,Weird.,"All right, how about this?",You two play each other.,Nine holes.,Winner gets my vote.,I'm game.,Ron?,An athletic competition where both parties are competing their hardest is certainly more honorable than whatever this charade is.,Sudden death playoff on the very course that hangs in the balance.,I could literally faint if I didn't have impeccable blood pressure.,"Oh, hey, everybody.",My name is Andy Dwyer.,You probably know me as the artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.,"Well, after tonight, you'll only know me as the former artist formerly known as the lead singer of Mouse Rat.",I'm retiring from music.,This is my swan song.,Once I was a golden swan   swan of a man  now that swan's name was Andy   and he started a rock and roll band   he made incredible nachos   that everybody claimed they loved   and then the band mates dicked him over   with a massive rock and roll shove   this is my swan song  watch me fly  Tom.,What happened to you?,MonaLisa happened to me.,She covered me in glitter and Anna Nicole body spray.,Why do they still even make that?,They don'tshe's had the same bottle for years.,She just mixes in water and baby oil.,"Now it's your turn to help me, okay?",You need to break things off with me and MonaLisa.,"Uh, Ann, this might be a battle you need to fight yourself.",I try not to get involved in other people's personal relationships.,Aah!,Don't hurt me.,Get me out of this friendship!,I'm gonna find a place  where I can be the beautiful duckling   I always was inside  whoa  whoa  whoa Why is there a gorilla guarding this gingerbread house?,Because minigolf is awesome.,"It's cute, and it's fun, and it needs to be saved.",Less talk.,More competing for my vote.,Wow.,This is it.,Ron leads by one.,"If he hits the ball into the dragon's mouth, he gets Jamm's vote.","Uh, bean sprouts.",Tofu.,Ralph Nader.,Ayn Rand is a terrible writer.,"Don't mess up, don't mess up, don't mess up.",Damn it!,Hole inone!,"Excellent win, Ron.","Even better loss, Leslie.","Ultimately, we learn the most about ourselves through the losses.","Swanson, I hate you.",Nothing will change that.,But I respect the hell out of your short game.,"You got my vote, hombre.","Hey, you got a holeinone on 18, so I'm supposed to give you this.","No, he gets the dragon too?",A fine trophy.,I think I'll keep it in the office.,"No, you won't.","Here, kid, want this, huh?",Yeah.,Take it and run.,Run!,"Tom, she's coming!",Tom!,"Okay, desperation time.",Follow my lead.,What lead?,What do you mean?,What are you oh.,"What the mothereffing, cing essing, effing king eff is going on right now?","Sorry, MonaLisa.",We can't keep our hands off each other.,That is accurate.,"Oh, it's all finally very clear.","All the times that you were like, ""Oh, no, Tom's no good for you.",""" And all the times you tried to break it off with me  I finally get it.",Mmhmm.,You guys want a threesome.,What?,No.,We do not wanna have a threesome with you.,"Well, let's not rush to judgment.","I mean, I say we hear her out.",Gross.,"Tom, good luck.",You still owe me a blanket.,"She's got a screw loose, am I right?",Actually she's not the one in my life I would call crazy.,"Look, I still don't think we should date.","Oh, me neither.","I've been single for an hour now, and it's the tits!",I'd still like to hook up though.,"Yo, do you wanna have a threesome with us?","Yeah, okay.",Cool.,Sweet.,All right.,All right.,"Yo, what up?",My name is MonaLisa.,"Well, hello, fellow employees.","Coworkers, I bid you adieu.","Whoa, fancy Andy.","Oh, me?",No.,This is just how I dress now.,Funny goofball music Andy is gone.,You're left with the professional remains.,I'm an adult now.,"I'm gonna focus on business, which is good.",Give me more time to play video games.,"Babe, you love that band that I also love so much.",They're important to you.,"Come on, call Burly and ask him to let you back in.","Why, so they can steal my swan song?","Ha, joke's on them.",I forgot it.,"No, business is my life now.","Okay, what's in there?",I don't know.,Iit's locked.,"Yeah, that's my briefcase.",Is it?,Good gravy.,"Oh, hello, Ron.",I believe you know this gorilla.,"It used to bring joy to hundreds of Pawnee families, but then you got rid of its habitat, so it died.",Your office shall serve as its monkey tomb.,How much did you pay for this?,Irrelevant.,I would pay any amount of money to properly shame you.,"Leslie, you should know by now that I live my life according to a certain set of principles, and I do not deviate from them.","Right, I mean, God forbid you're flexible in any way.","You should just stick to your stupid, rigid, antigovernment principles.",But you know what?, Those principles stink., They're not the right principles., You may think so., I do not., Thank you for my new silver-backed friend., I like him very much.," I will call him ""$9,000 of taxpayer money the gorilla.",""" That is a terrible-- his name is Mr.", Fuzzyface! Hey.," How did your wild dirtbag fantasy night work out? Well, Mona-Lisa and the random girl she grabbed after you left got into a fistfight in the parking lot."," Eventually, Mona-Lisa threw a cinderblock through the girl's windshield."," She dives in, steals her purse, doesn't go for the money, steals all her birth control pills, and says, ""Bitch, you're gonna get pregnant.",""" She then pretends those are ecstasy and sells it to a bunch of college kids that are drinking Goldschl?ger at a gas station.", You have to break up with her., I tried., Again., It did not go well.," Did she assault you? - No, this was a sexual injury."," - Okay, gross."," Anyway, here's your chenille blanket.", You earned it., Thanks for your help.," Tom, thank you."," Eh, be nice to Chenille O'Neal.", I will., It needs to be brushed regularly., Never use a lint roller., - I'm dead serious., - Okay., And keep it out of direct sunlight.," If I see this at one picnic, I swear-- Okay, you know what, I don't even want it anymore."," Yes! Thank you! What's up, yellow head? Jamm, are you here to rub it in my face that I lost your vote last night? Well, I was, but it doesn't have to go down that way.", You shook Ron's hand and told him that you were gonna vote to close the putt-putt., My word is garbage., Everyone knows that., Let's talk deal.," What can you offer me to change my mind? Wow, Jamm, even for you, this is pretty sleazy."," Hey, don't act so shocked."," A few months ago, you traded me your office for that stupid swimming pool bill.", Last night you bring in a teenage girl to pump me full of snow cones., This is simply how people like us operate., I have six things to say to you., One: You drive me nuts with your rigid code of honor.," Two: Congratulations, putt-putt has been defunded."," And only because Jamm was going to double-cross you, and I made him stick to his word.", Three: I am furious that putt-putt has been defunded., Four: I am sorry that I said the gorilla's blood was on your hands., 'Twas Leslie killed the beast.," Five: Putt-putt is for children, and they are the future, and I have already written a ballot measure that will save it, and it will pass."," And six: Your rigid code of honor, which drives me nuts, makes you a wonderful human being, and I am proud to call you my friend, and don't ever change.", - You want a drink? - Very much.," Burly, I just want to say I'm sorry that I haven't been to rehearsal and that I won't let you sing or write songs or walk out onstage in front of me."," Man, I love playing with you guys.", And I want back in if you'll let me.," Well, we never wanted to kick you out."," It's just, you didn't show up for practice, - and we like to play.", - Right.," If you wanna come back in, you can.", I'm more of a backup singer anyways., You can say that again.," No, no, no."," Hey, you got a great voice."," Yeah, Ben! God, don't say that."," - Welcome back, buddy.", - Yes.," All right! Hey, I'll even try melting the cheese on the nachos.", All right., It won't work., You're gonna look like such an idiot.," I have been in the city council for almost a year, and I'm proud of what I've done."," But every once in a while, I end up in a situation that makes my stomach queasy.", You're in politics.," What did you expect? Frankly, I hoped it would be like dealing with you.", People with strong opinions hashing it out respectfully., And then you either realize that I'm right or you get hungry and go home and I win., There are a lot of Jeremy Jamms along the path you're walking., I suppose you just need to figure out whether it's a path you truly wanna walk., Yeah., I'm taking that gorilla with me and putting it back in the putt-putt - when it reopens.," - Sorry, no.", That gorilla was a gift from a very determined co-worker whom I respect., And there's a certain code of honor that accompanies gift-giving.," God, you're the worst."," Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mouse Rat's Reunion Show, featuring me, Andy Dwyer, and for the first time, Andrew ""Burly"" Burlinson on lead vocals."," That's right, two lead vocalists.", Name one other band that's done that., The Beatles.," Three, four!

                ",Season: 5 Episode: 22,"Okay, everyone.",Look in your folders.,You will find information about founder's week.,"And before we start brainstorming, I just wanna thank Ron for lending us his cabin.",Lending?,Makes it sound like I had a choice in the matter.,I never should've agreed to this or let you know that I have a cabin or gotten to know any of you.,That's the spirit.,Founder's week is a yearly celebration of all things Pawnee.,"We've got a pieeating contest, a giant petting zoo, and the granddaddy of them all, the founder's week parade.","I don't wanna overhype it, but our parade makes the rose bowl parade look like a turdsonwheels convention.",Let's do an exercise.,"April, what makes Pawnee the best city in the world?",Easy: Most murders per capita.,The guillotine was invented here.,City Hall is run by the walrus mafia.,"Donna, help me out.",What makes Pawnee so great?,Cost of living is cheap.,"In about three years, I will have saved enough to pay off my condo in Seattle.",You have a condo in Seattle?,"Yes, I like the rain and the fish markets.","Guys, we need to focus.","I want this to be the best founder's week ever, okay?",No more distractions.,I'm bored.,Let's go have sex in a tree.,He'll be back in eight minutes.,Why did you have to bring her here?,I don't really have any power in this relationship.,I'll think of ideas in the tree.,Anyone's welcome to join us in the tree!,Really?,Okay.,Thank you.,Bye.,You okay?,"Yeah, I'm fine.","Good morning, colleagues, coworkers, friends.",Everyone feeling normal today?,Here's what happened.,I left my sweat shirt at Ron's cabin.,"When I went back to get it, I found this in the trash: Positive pregnancy test.",Side note: I accidentally threw my sweat shirt away.,That's why I was digging through the trash.,Found that too.,Pretty cool.,"So if my science is correct, one of the five women who were at the cabin Leslie, Donna, Ann, MonaLisa, or April is pregnant!",Can't be April.,She would've told me.,That leaves four suspects.,"There's only one man for this job: Bert Macklin, FBI.",They said I was retired.,They said I was too dangerous for the Pawnee Police Department.,Turns out they were right and wrong.,"Macklin, you son of a bitch.","Hello, fellow Pawneeans.","As you know, the founder's week festivities kick off tomorrow.","Um, one small announcement: Due to a tragic misunderstanding, the prettiest pig beauty pageant has been replaced by a pork rib barbecue competition.","Oh, no.","But on to less grisly news, thank you for participating in our special founder's week public forum led by councilwoman Leslie Knope.","Thanks to a lot of hard work and some very dedicated civil servants, this has been a banner year for our city.",Obesity and diabetes are down.,Test scores are up.,Pawnee raccoon attacks have decreased.,"People can now suddenly feel safe in our parks, grocery stores, and hospitals.",I am very proud of what we've accomplished.,"In fact, this forum is kind of my victory lap.",I am here today to ask you one question.,Are you better off now than you were a year ago?,Who'd like to start?,Uhoh.,"Kathryn Pinewood, Pawnee Restaurant Association.",This town is not better off.,"This past year has been a disaster, and this government is hellbent on stripping away our most basic personal freedoms.","Okay, counterpoint.",Ms.,"Pinewood, I've never stripped away anyone's freedoms.",I simply stopped a restaurant from serving an insane which only made our citizens healthier.,"And frankly, I don't see any of those citizens standing up and complaining abo Okay.","Now, I see them.",Whoa!,Darren!,Slow down!,"That sweat suit's not for sweatin' in, okay?",This is crushed velvet.,"If you go at more than a brisk walk, it will fall apart.",This looks dope.,Let's pay for it.,Business is booming.,"If it keeps up like this, I would leave the Parks Department and do RentASwag fulltime, maybe even expand.","I could add a baby section over there, call it ""Li'l Swaggers.",""" I could add some old people stuff, call it ""RentASag.",""" Ugh, no.",Old people are gross.,Oh.,Nice.,"Hey, dingdong!",Can I go home?,"My tumtum feels gross, and also, I hate working.","I guess, but find someone to cover for you, okay?",'Cause we're really busy right now.,"Also, a lawyer guy called you.","He sounded really sexy on the phone, and I was very into that.","Like, I was, like, very into that.","All right, let's set up some boundaries on what's cool for you to say to me, okay?",Okay.,I frenched my cousin one time.,That's gross.,I might still be in love with him.,Please leave.,"All right, bye.","Tom Haverford, my name is Trevor Nelsson.",I represent a client who would like to make you an offer.,Babyface heard my demo?,I will accept a record deal.,"No, you deeply misunderstand.",My client has taken an interest in RentASwag.,He'd like to know if you are looking to sell a controlling interest in the store.,"Whoa, Diddy wants to buy RentASwag?",Not what I said.,This is a lot to process.,Will Diddy be coming to the meeting?,I'm not at liberty to tell you who my client is.,It would violate confidentiality.,I understand.,It's not Diddy.,Got it.,Oh.,"Oh, helloAnn.","Oh, boy.","What do you want, Macklin?",Me?,Just observing.,A little something they taught us down at Quantico.,"Well, I guess I'll get out of your hair.","Wait, there is just one more question.",Congratulations.,Is that a question?,"It's an accusation, 'cause I know your secret.",You're pregnant.,What?,I'm not pregnant.,You're not?,Damn it.,Who is?,'Cause I found this at Ron Swanson's cabin.,It's a pregnancy test.,"Oh, my God.",Someone we know is pregnant?,I'm trying to get pregnant.,That's not fair.,"I mean, great, and happy for them, and congratulations, whatever, but ooh!",No!,Boo!,We have to find out who this is.,"Whoa, I don't think so.",Bert Macklin works alone.,I will buy lunch.,You can have as many burgers as you want.,Welcome to the FBI.,Ms.,"Pinewood, Leslie's public health initiative has been a huge success.",Pawnee is no longer the fourth most obese city in America.,We're now ninth.,"Together, as a town, we lost an amount of weight equal to 800 pregnant manatees.","A gym opened, and it stayed in business.",And people checking into the E.,R.,after ingesting a whole candy wrapper is down 40%.,But where will it end?,"Now, you wanna rob our children of fun by attacking the Sweetums school lunch program, literally taking candy from babies.",Those school lunches are incredibly unhealthy.,You somehow convinced the school board that napkins are a vegetable.,They're made from plants.,Stop restricting our freedoms.,Yeah!,My name is Dewey from Sanitation.,"Ever since you stripped us of our freedoms by making us hire women, we've had to turn one of our bathrooms into a woman's bathroom.",We only have one bathroom now.,"I'm so sorry, Dewey.",That sounds like a horrible price to pay for something as trivial as gender equality.,So you agree.,Bjorn Lerpiss of the Pawnee Lerpiss family.,There was supposed to be a Paunch Burger in this lot next to my house.,"And then, you stripped my freedom by putting a park there.","Now, if I wanna start my day off with a tripledecker pancake breakfast pizza, I gotta go to the one that's 10 minutes away, and that makes me 20 minutes late to work every day.",I work at home.,Have you ever considered not eating that for breakfast?,I'll never consider that.,This feels strangely personal.,Maybe it's because they're all standing up saying how much they hate me as a person.,"How many people am I talking to, Donna?",One or 1 1/9?,Are you asking me if I'm pregnant?,Oh.,Interesting.,I don't remember saying anything about anyone being pregnant.,Are you sure it's not you?,I'm a grown woman with a good head on her shoulders.,Don't worry about me.,Whew.,This case just got interesting.,"Well, not just.",It was pretty interesting to begin with.,This case just remained interesting.,"Listen, my wife and I do not feel that we're better off than a year ago because a year ago, this town was not a horrifying sex den where people could put their body parts anywhere they want with impunity.","And then, you were elected.","And now, this town a horrifying sex den where people can put their body parts anywhere they want to with impunity.",Yeah.,"If you are referring to my fight to teach comprehensive sex education, you need to at least acknowledge the fact that STDs are down 14% from last year.",And deviant behavior in Pawnee is up a billion percent!,"No, it's no, it's This town is going to hell in a Gucci knockoff handbag, girl.",See?,See?,They agree.,Come on.,"I am definitely better off than I was a year ago, and it's all thanks to Leslie Knope.",This woman singlehandedly saved my business.,"Thank you, Dennis.","There you go, perfect example.",No need for further questions on that one.,"Oh, I'm sorry.","What is your business, sir?","Oh, I run a pornographic DVD emporium.","Well, it used to be a quaint, little movie rental place with a lot of community value.","Oh, it's much better now.",Yeah!,Leslie is the best.,"No, no, Brandi.","Gah, gah, gah, gah  Hello, everyone.","I'm Brandi Maxxxx  Hi, Brandi.","Star of such films as the incredible Burt Wonderbone, A Good Guy to Lay Hard, and Argo.",I had a small part in Argo as well as the porn version Our Goo.,I've seen the first 90 seconds.,It's thrilling.,"If it weren't for Leslie Knope, there would be far, far less pornography in this town.","No, what happened was there was a misunderstanding, and I accidentally got the government involved in an unseemly business, but I cleared that up, and everything's fine.",It's not like I'm some kind of sexcrazed maniac or something.,"Leslie, are you pregnant?",Did you or did you not leave this positive pregnancy test in a dumpster in the woods?,"Hey, everybody.",No.,Really?,Okay.,"Well, I'll get out of your hair.",Sorry to interrupt.,Was that Brandi Maxxxx?,"Investors, I have some very exciting news about RentASwag.","Someone I'm not saying Diddy, but I'm not not saying Diddy has offered to buy out RentASwag for a buttload of money.","How big a buttload, son?",We would all basically double our investments.,Are you kidding me?,"Sell, baby.",Imagine the kind of treatyourself day we could have with the profits.,I'm talking pedicures on pedicures on pedicures.,That is appealing.,"If someone is interested in buying you out, it means you're doing something right.","I say you continue to grow, accumulate power, find this investor, and buy his business to teach him a lesson.","April, what do you think?",I thought about this a lot.,"I actually think that you should get a ""Hello Kitty"" tattoo.","No, with the store.",Oh.,"Uh, burn it for the insurance money.","Tom, listen to me, if there's one thing I've learned  God, nobody cares, Gary.",Enough.,Thank you.,I miss you guys.,What a wonderful event.,Everyone is having fun.,This is great.,"Chris, could you just please I'm sorry, I was just trying to cheer you up.",Just hang in there.,Thanks.,"All right, if you'll excuse me, I found out this morning that I am playing a special role in this parade.",No spoilers.,"Honey, I hate to state the obvious, but you chose a life in politics.","I mean, the more you actually accomplish, the more heat you're gonna draw.","Yeah, I know.",Let's go watch the parade.,You know you can't resist a parade.,That's true.,Parades and your butt:  My two vices.,There you go.,"Whoa, what are you doing?",My assistant has something she'd like to show you.,Partner.,"Oh, my assistant has something she'd like to show you, partner.","It's a positive pregnancy test, Tom.",I found it outside of Ron's cabin after our brainstorming session.,Is there any possibility MonaLisa could be pregnant?,We always use protection but I'm pretty positive she pokes holes in them.,What brand pregnancy test is it?,"It's called ""Womb There It Is.",""" That's her brand.",I'm gonna be a dad?,I'm gonna have a baby with JeanRalphio's sister?,"Oh, God.",What have I done?,"Like, to humanity?",This is the perfect thing to take my mind off of yesterday.,I am going to pretend that this is my victory parade and the town is celebrating my hard work and dedication.,There you go.,"Leslie, Leslie.",I'm so sorry.,I need to talk to you.,What are what?,I'm the Nipple King.,Kernston's Rubber Nipple Company elects a nipple king and a nipple queen every year to ride on the float.,"Congratulations, Chris.",Thank you.,It's such an amazing honor.,It's wonderful.,"But I do need to talk to you about a float that is in this parade, because I'm not sure that you're going to be  No fun for you!",Uhoh.,No fun for you!,Is that me?,Maybe it's not you.,Maybe it's Kate Upton.,"Oh, thank you.","No, it's me, and damn them.",No fun for you!,Hey!,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!","Hey, stop, please!",Stop!,"Excuse me, Pawnee.","I'm sorry, I don't mean to stop your parade or anything, but I just have to say something here, okay?",I don't think this is very fair!,"Babebabe, stop wagging your finger.",Certain people are lashing out at me because of things that I did this year.,But I am not trying to stop you from having fun.,I am an extremely fun person.,"This float represents a group of over 300 business owners, individuals, and community leaders who are protesting unfair government regulation.",We are the committee to recall Leslie Knope.,Let's kick her out of office.,Recall Knope!,Recall Knope!,Recall Knope!,Recall Knope!,Legalize weed!,Recall Knope!,Recall Knope!,"So, I need to ask you something and I kinda wish JeanRalphio wasn't here.","Please tell me that you're dumping my sister, because I will laugh I will laugh so much.","Actually, it may be the opposite.",Is this yours?,"No, no.",Yeah.,It's mine.,I'm pregnant.,Lemony snicket.,"Oh, my God, are you serious?",I'm gonna be an uncle?,Is that a real thing?,Is that gonna happen?,"No, no, that's too much too much responsibility for me.",I gottaI gotta find another way out of this.,"Well, I wish you told me.","I mean, obviously, we need to talk about our future.","Maybe I could sell the business, and we could use the profits to put a down payment on a house or something, or  Psych!",What?,"Ah, ha, ha.",Look at your stupid face.,You had a dumdum face.,That was hilarious.,"Oh, that was  hilarious   That's hilarious  So you're not pregnant?",This isn't yours?,"[Bleep], no.","Do you know how many different pills I take, birth control or otherwise?",There is no way that I could be pregnant with a human baby.,Thank God.,Yes!,Tommy has his life back!,Let's go!,"What the hell is wrong with you, man?",That's my sister.,Nah!,"I'm just kidding, man.",She's the worst.,"You dodged a bullet, baby.",Congratulations.,Thanks.,"Bad, bad, bad, bad.","Well, Macklin, it's not MonaLisa.","It's not me, it's not Donna, it's not Leslie.",There was only one other woman at that cabin.,April?,"No, she would've told me.","Besides, the math doesn't add up because we only have sex every single day.","And since she's the only one that we haven't talked to, it has to be hers.","Oh, my God.",I don't like seeing you like this.,I've never felt this way before.,Maybe I should just quit.,"Maybe we should both quit, and we should move to the Bahamas, live on a beach, catch fish with homemade spears.","Yeah, you'd last about 30 seconds with that work.","When we went to Hawaii, you woke me up at 3:00 A.",M.,to watch Meet the Press.,"Well, it was Elizabeth Warren.","Like, I'm not going to watch that live?","Look, you can hate your job sometimes.",It's allowed.,But let me ask you this: Do you think this town is better off  than it was a year ago?,Yes.,Do you stand behind everything you've done?,Yes.,Then screw 'em.,"But even if I wanted to fight this recall, how would I do it?", Thank you all for coming.," As most of you probably know, there is a large committee that has announced plans to recall me from office.", My response to them is this: Bring it on., Step up., Step Up 2: The Streets.," I'm sorry, my adrenaline is pumping, so all I can think of is dance movie titles.", Stomp the Yard., There's one.," Look, I work very hard for this town, as hard as I can, and all that matters to me is whether or not everyone here thinks that they are better off now than they were a year ago.", I think you are.," If you disagree with me, then go ahead and recall me.", Go crazy., You Got Served.," Silver Linings Playbook, kind of.", The committee says they plan to push for a recall vote within two months., - Do you have a comment on that? - Nope.," Again, all I really care about is are you better off? I think I'm better off."," I haven't had a date in a while, but I'm learning a lot about me."," Well, I wasn't asking you specifically, but I'm happy to hear that, Shauna."," So, in conclusion, recall, shmecall."," No, I can't end my big press conference by saying ""Recall, shmecall.",""" That's ridiculous."," Ben, can you help me out here? That concludes councilwoman Knope's press conference."," And if you have any further questions hold on to them, because she has a lot of work to do."," Thanks, honey.", Honey., That's another dance movie with Jessica alba.," Alright, people.", The Pawnee river's not gonna clean itself.," Volunteer weekend task force, mobilize."," Oh, Leslie, this goes without saying, but if you need any speeches or testimonials or just general enthusiasm for your recall fight, I'm your man."," - Thank you, Chris.", - You're welcome., I'll see you at the river.," Oh, oh, oh! Last one to pick up has still accomplished a great deal."," Hey, maybe after, you wanna come meet me and Chris for a drink? Sure."," Hey, how's it going with you guys? We're great, actually, and we're having a good time.", - Sex is ridiculous., - Mm-hmm.," Hopefully, that ridiculous sex will lead to a baby.", I'm so happy for you., Just remember to use protection.," Wait, no, don't.", That would defeat the purpose.," Okay, no.", Do your thing.," Yeah! - My wife is pregnant! - Okay, put me down."," Hey, you can't keep it from me."," I found the pregnancy test, honey."," Honey, I'm not pregnant, okay? And if I were, you shouldn't lift me up."," Wait, are you sure you're not? Yeah.", We've talked about this., Remember? I wanna wait until we're 50 and then adopt a set of creepy adult twins from Romania.," Oh, yeah.", Of course.," Actually, there is something I need to tell you.", You're pregnant., - No., - No! We just ruled that out.," - Ah, dang it."," - Okay, a while ago, I applied to veterinary school in Bloomington, and I just found out that I got in."," You did? That's amazing! Wait, why did you wait to tell me? Because I don't even know if I wanna go, okay? I mean, yes, it's been my dream to work with animals since I was a kid and everything."," But it would mean I would be spending a lot of time apart from you, and Oh, we could get through that."," I mean, look."," It would suck for a while, and I would miss you while you're gone."," But as I've known about you for the past 20 seconds, this is your dream.", I'm really glad I married you.," Yeah, we made a good call on that one.", So I just wanted to let you know I will not be selling Rent-A-Swag., And you can go tell your client he now has 100 problems? - Is it Jay-Z? - No.," But since you're not taking the deal, I should inform you that my client will be moving on to plan B: Opening his own store directly across the street from yours."," Across the street? What kind of store is it gonna be? He's calling it ""Tommy's Closet.",""" It's a high-end secondhand clothing store where parents can rent clothes for their teens, tweens, and pres, as well as babies, toddlers, grown-ups, and olds.", But that's my idea and my name.," So I guess only Domino's is allowed to sell pizza now? It's called capitalism, Mr."," Haverford, and you are about to get a free lesson.", Only this free lesson is going to cost you., So it's not free? You're right., That was confusing., This lesson will cost you., Good day.," This sucks, but I have to admit: It's a pretty baller move.", You sure this isn't Diddy? - It is Diddy., - I knew it! It's not Diddy.," Are you sure everything will be all right if April goes to vet school? There are no sure things in life, son, but you two seem pretty solid to me."," - Change is good, I guess.", - Not to me., Leslie's going around asking everybody if they're better off than they were a year ago., All I care about is that I'm the same.," If I'm the same as I was a year ago, I'm happy."," Wait, I forgot."," - Who the hell is pregnant? - What? I found a pregnancy test at your cabin, and I checked with all the girls over there.", It wasn't any of them.," Hello, darling.", What a surprise., Hey., Can we talk? Maybe in private?   ,"

how.,We were so careful.,I warned you about this.,Standard birth control methods aren't usually effective against a Swanson.,"I got about a million thoughts running around in my head, but I really just want to know what you're thinking.","Okay, here's what I'm thinking.","I was gonna wait until our anniversary, take you somewhere romantic, perhaps in a canoe most likely in a canoe.","I actually built a canoe for that purpose, but given the news, and given my significant feelings for you, now seems as good a time as any.",Ron Swanson.,Diane Lewis will you marry me?,Yes.,On one condition.,"Anything, my love.","Ask me for anything in the world, and I'll give it to you, except a destination wedding.",Just the opposite.,We've both been married before.,I don't want anything big or elaborate.,"In fact, the smaller the better.",I assume you can deal with that.,Are you kidding?,"As far as I'm concerned, we could go up to the fourth floor right now.","Well, hello there.","Hey, Leslie.",What's with the getup?,We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.,There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.,Where are you guys

bouquet of highlighters?,"Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice.",Why is there no rice in this municipal government building?,I found a justice guy.,These are the marrying

together, and we're having so much fun.",And check this out.,"Oh, no, there's no ring.",We just had manicures together recently.,"Sorry, that was misleading.","Ah, Mr.","Haverford, back again, I see.","What the hell, man?",This looks exactly like my store!,I know.,My client is a very determined businessman.,"When he rips someone off, he goes all the way.","You see, you are Hydrox, Mr.",Haverford.,We are Oreo.,"Your mysterious, unnamed client seems like a pretty intense guy.",I am impressed by how quickly he was able to move such a large amount of merchandise.,Mm.,He must be one heck of a transporter.,"My client is not Jason Statham, if that's what you're thinking.",Some mysterious big shot investor has opened up a store directly across the street from rentaswag to try to put me out of business.,"I'm not worried, though.",I've poured my heart and soul into my store.,I'm sure this guy's just looking for a place to store all his NBA championship trophies.,It's not Lebron James.,Damn.,"Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think ""No problem too small"" is working.","I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers.","I agree, we need something massive and attentiongetting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning.",I got it!,What is it?,"Oh, no, I just I got a fly.",I have something.,"Remember phase 13, ""Think outside of the box""?",Of course.,It was an amazing phase.,Easily a top five phase.,"Well, I thought outside of the box, and I nominated you for this big award.","It's called ""The International Coalition of Women in Government,"" and you won.","There's, like, five winners, and you get a big trophy or something.","Oh, my God, this is real.",I just assumed you were lying.,"Thank you, but yeah, it's real.","Ann Richards won it once, and Janet Napolitano, I think.",Janet Napolifrakingtano?,"Oh, my God.",This is amazing and perfect.,"This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention.",When is the ceremony?,Next monthin London.,London?,London?,We're going to London?,"We're going to London, you guys!",I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!,"No, that's Buckingham Palace.",Hogwarts is fictional.,Do you know that?,It's important to me that you know that.,"Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today.","Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history.","History began on July 4, 1776.",Everything before that was a mistake.,"Diane suggested we ""tag along to London"" for a honeymoon.","I agreed, because my love for her trumps my hatred for Europe.","Then she hit a phase of morning sickness that knocked her for a loop and decided to stay home, but she insisted I go and take pictures for her.","All of this could have been avoided if we'd followed my plan for a honeymoon: a steak dinner, a glass of Lagavulin whiskey, then vigorous lovemaking for two hours, and we're both asleep by 8:30.","Hey, Leslie, we're gonna head to the meeting.",Are you okay?,"Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee.",It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.,"Leslie, you're in London.","You're 4,000 miles away from home.","Try to enjoy this, okay?","Yeah, you're right, as usual.",Good luck.,"Ooh, hey boss man, I want to go home early.","Ooh, hold on, actually.",Hang on.,"Yeah, no.",I want to quit and never come here again.,"Okay, bye.",I can't believe I used to date you!,Tommy Pickles!,You see there's a better version of your store across the street?,"And those guys are giving out free pizza with ""papperonas.",""" I know, man.",That's my competition.,"They're trying to put me out of business, and it's working.","Three weeks ago, this place was hopping.",My clothes were flying off the rack.,I was spreading swag around town like a killer swag virus.,"Now, look at this place.",It's dead!,What am I gonna do?,"It's like I always say, okay?","When life gives you lemons, you sell some of your grandma's jewelry, and you go clubbing.",That's not a good piece of advice.,So I'ma throw up.,I ate too much cheese.,I'll talk to you!,I need some better friends.,So the only thing you did was stop drinking beer?,"Yeah, I lost 50 pounds in one month.",How much beer were you drinking?,"I know, right?",Probably too much.,"Andy and I are meeting with an English charity foundation to expand our afterschool music program, and British people love me.","There was this British kid in my high school who always called me ""Big Ben"" and would punch me really hard on the arm, and go, ""Bong!",Bong!,"Bo"" Oh, he might have hated me.","Real quick, should I do a British accent?","Um, I'm gonna say no.",You sure?,Yeah.,I can do one.,"It's not very good, but I think I could pull it off.",I just feel like he's gonna get upset when he finds out that we're American.,He knows we're American.,"Ugh, great.","All right, well, I guess we'll take the meeting anyway.","After all, we did come all the way down under.",No.,"Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt.","This is Andy Dwyer, and it is an honor to meet you, sir.","Well, it's nice to meet you too.","However, the proper mode of address would be ""Your Royal Excellency, Lord Edgar Darby Covington, ""14th Earl of CornwalluponThames, of Hertfordshire.",""" No, no, no, I'm kidding.",I'm kidding.,Oh!,"Please, call me Eddie.","Oh, thank God.",I knew that other name must have been a stupid joke.,"Andy No, no, no, no, he's absolutely right, it's an absurd name.","Well, I'm excited to hear about your musical charity idea.",Shall we?,Yeah.,"The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, andoh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also.",What do we do?,"Ron, your pick.","Look, a clock.",We don't have that in America.,You call that a tower?,"Try the Sears Tower, friend.","""London at night.",""" That is very funny.","Can I help you, sir?",Yes.,I will take this.,"We don't accept American currency, sir.",Of course you do.,That's the most wonderful piece of paper in the world.,Accept it.,"Very sorry, sir.",Fine.,"Enjoy the fact that your royal overlords are a frail, old woman and a tiny baby.","You really think this will work, Donna?",Why wouldn't it?,We just pull the business license it's public information and then at least you'll have an address.,"Ooh, here.","Hmm, some kind of shady, fake shell corporation  called ""Open 4 Business, LLC.","""  Thanks, Donna.","Hey, if it's Akon and y'all become best friends, I want a ride on his plane.",Done and done.,Nice.,"""1020 Maple Street.",""" Ann and Chris?",What are they doing here?,"Sir, you can't go in there!",Aha!,I caught you!,"Hey, it's Tom!",What the hell are you doing?,What am I doing?,What are you doing here?,Dr.,"Saperstein is giving me a sonogram, in his doctor's office, for women, because I'm pregnant!","Oh, my God.",You're JeanRalphio's dad!,Mmhmm.,You're the one that's trying to put me out of business!,"Well, look at that, Mr.",Haverford.,You tracked me down.,"Looks like your detective skills are a lot better than your tween, highend fashion rental skills.","Ann, Chris, can we have the room, please?","No, you certainly cannot.",Dr.,"Saperstein, why are you doing this?",What did I ever do to you?,You know exactly why I'm doing this.,You destroyed my family.,"First, you screwed my son out of your business, and then you stole my daughter's virginity.","Wait, you're serious?",Deadly serious.,"According to my daughter, you broke her heart.",Then you smashed up her BMW.,"I had to buy her a new one, so she could drive to Divinity School.","Let me tell you something, mister.","You attack a Saperstein, you face my wrath.","Be so sure about this, Tiny Tom, that I will crush you like the bug you are And there it is, the heartbeat.",Ohh.,Everything sounds perfect.,Ohh.,This is the moment we were dreaming of: you and me and our baby.,And Tom and his weird feud with our doctor.,"So this afterschool music program has been really successful in Pawnee, and we've expanded it to eight other towns in Indiana, but we feel with your help, we can Whoa!",Are those I'm sorry.,I'm sorry.,Are those remote control helicopters?,Yeah.,What?,I got them as a gift.,"I bought them for one of my nephews,  and then I decided to keep them.",Yeah.,Would you like to play with them?,"Oh, would I?",I call blue one!,I call the oh.,"Okay, you get the blue one.","Andy, we are guests of Lord Covington.",Maybe you should let him play with the blue helicopter.,"What are you talking about, dude?",I called it.,He called it.,That's the rule.,That's the rule.,"Anyway, the orange one's better.",What?,Come on.,Aah!,"Hey, get off!","Okay, watch out!",Watch out!,Agh!,Ohh!,"Dude, awesome.",I think I broke mine!,"Oh, bummer.","So, like, you your family owns all this stuff?","Well, no, not everything.","We own that building, that one, that house, that round thing, that one.",We don't own that.,"Oh, no, actually, we do own that.",What else does your family own?,"Well, um, have you heard of Scotland?","As I was saying, we've really made this music program work in Indiana, and we think, with your help, we could turn this into a widereaching international program.","Oh, you know what I want?",Ice cream.,"Do you guys have that here, ice cream?","Oh, it's so good.",You have to get it.,"It's, like, scoops, and it comes on a cone.",Yeah.,Do you have that here?,We have it.,Of course we  You have it?,"Where do you think you are, the moon?",That'd be awesome if we were.,Yeah.,Can we get some?,Could we docould we have some?,Could we?,Sure.,Yeah.,Let's go.,Just what do I do with this?,Just throw it there.,Roger will pick it up.,Oh.,"""So I long for a day ""when women in government will simply be seen ""as people in government, but until then, ""I will work to make Pawnee, my wonderful hometown, as good as it can be.",""" What do you think?","I think you should lose the first line and the last line and all of the other lines, and instead, just walk up to the mic and meow really loudly for eight minutes.","Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know?",I want to know what's happening there.,One little news blast wouldn't hurt.,Welcome to The Final Word With Perd.,Ms.,"Pinewood, there is a thing you are doing, and that thing is you are leading a recall vote against Councilwoman Knope, and you say you have new, shocking allegations about her.",What?,What now?,"Perd, I take no pleasure in reporting this, but it must come to light.","We are here, trying to make Pawnee better, and where is Leslie Knope?",She's gallivanting around Europe like some kind of European.,Howhow did they get that picture so Facebook.,But I just put  Facebook.,But isn't it a  Facebook.,"Apparently, she can't be bothered to stay here in Pawnee, not when there's Europe to gallivant around in.","Well, we conducted a Perd poll and asked this question: not be in Europe, and 35% said they were confused by the way the question was posed.","Oh, my God.",You're leaving tonight?,I can't believe there's even a flight?,"Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 redeye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.",M.,"back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned.",Easy breezy!,"Leslie, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do not think you should leave Europe right now.",You flew all this way.,Have some perspective.,You have some perspective!,I'm sorry.,Maybe you're right.,Maybe I'm stressed.,"Okay, I need to calm down.",Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.,"Ugh, who is that?",Hold up.,My dad said that?,"Yeah, JeanRalphio.",He told me that I had screwed you  out of my business  What?,So he was gonna screw me back.,Any idea why he'd believe such a thing?,That is so weird.,"That is so oh, you know what?","Honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, this may be it.",I actually told him that RentASwag was my idea and that you had stole it from me.,Why would you say that?,"Because my dad is always riding me for never having a job, and I just didn't want to show that I blew it again.",Ohand I don't know if this is relevant  Hmm.,But I told him that you made me sign up for a bunch of credit cards and then max them out by buying illegal white jaguar fur coats.,"That's probably not relevant, though.","It's probably not relevant, though.",I don't know  I guess All this lying about me stops now!,Hmm.,This is my life.,"Please, one of you has to tell him the truth.",Not it!,Not it!,"Ooh, you got me!",Whoa ho!,"Uhoh, uhoh!","Uhoh, uhoh, uhoh.",Uhoh.,"Okay, fine.",You know what?,I'm gonna do the unthinkable.,"I'm gonna have a short, honest conversation with my father.",Thank you.,"Oh, that's a big cheering section.","Okay, that's Khongordzol, from Mongolia.","She grew up in a hut that was entirely made of ice and mud, then she became their mayor, then their police chief and their best Wolverine Wrangler.",I love her.,"Oh, hi.",You must be Leslie Knope.,I'm Ulee Danssen.,I'm one of the honorees.,"Wow, look at your face.",What?,It's just so symmetrical.,"Oh, thanks!","You know, we all have that in Denmark.","Oh, you're from Denmark, of course.","Wow, what part of Denmark are you from?",I'm from Silkeborg.,You know.,"It's not one of the most perfect places in the world, but I love it, and it loves me.",And look what they've done for me.,They made a statue of you!,Yes.,Wow.,Is that goat cheese?,"Good cheese eye, Leslie.",It is made out of goat cheese.,"We have a lot of it, and after tonight's event, they're going to consume me with crackers.",They just love me.,What about your town?,"Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me.",And they're trying to kick me out of office.,"One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right?","I don't, no.",So you're from Mongolia?,Will you take me with you when you go back there?,I love you.,Hmm.,Did you understand that?,Did you bring any wolverines?,Say it again.,Say it again.,Aluminium.,"Okay, okay.",You say it.,You say it.,You say it.,"It's ""alumilum.","""  ""Alumilum""?",Okay.,Alumilum!,"Uh, Eddie if you'd like me to talk more about the program,  I would be happy to  Mmhmm.","But my wife is receiving an award in just a few minutes, and I really need to get over there.","Yes, of course.","The thing is, I don't know what I'm doing.",Me neither.,I'm sorry?,My family has a huge amount of money.,"We live in a castle that has 1,000 acres of land.","Our hedge maze is so vast, once, I got lost in there for two days.",What?,That's awesome.,It was awesome.,"There was a statue of a lion inside, and I found a yoyo.","Well, do you do you have it here?","Guys  The point is, I started this foundation in order to do something good with our money, and I've heard hundreds of charity pitches, and I honestly don't know whether they're good or bad.","If I may, ours is great.",Brilliant!,I'm in.,What?,Are you serious?,Yeah.,"I like you, I like music.","On one condition: I want you to stay here in London with me for no more than three months, to help me get it up and running and tell me what to do.","Oh, well, that actually may be tough.","I mean, my wife is in the middle of this recall fight, and I really need to Oh, no, no, no, no, no.","No, no, I meant Andy.",I want Andy to stay.,Is that a goose that just flew by the window?,"Oh, it's a plastic bag.",Did you see that?,"Wait, did I interrupt?",What are you guys talking about?,Let's see if it was a goose.,"I think it could have been, honest to God.","Silkeborg is wonderful, and I am very supported and loved.","Once, on my birthday, the town trained a reindeer to do a dance for me.","It was beautiful, and the reindeer was delicious.",Hey.,Hey!,How was your meeting?,Good.,I'll fill you in later.,Are you ready for your speech?,Uhyeah.,Yeah.,"Thank you, Ulee.",It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.,"Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States, Leslie Knope.","First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women.",You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.,"I mean, they're just truly You know, I've been a public servant for a long time.",And you know how I spend my days?,Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.,"And I love my town, but you know how they repay me?",By hating me.,They hate me.,They want to recall me.,I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.,You're always welcome in Silkeborg!,"Olga, let's start a statue of Leslie.",See?,"They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there.","I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks.","The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit.","You know, I'm sick of it.",Pawnee is filled with a bunch of peepeeheads.,Thank you very much for this amazing award.,"I'm sorry I said ""peepeeheads.",""" Whoo!",That's my boss!,"That speech was a little rough, don't you think?","Whatever, it's how I feel.","Stupid, ungrateful town.","Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away.",Hello.,"Leslie, it's Jerry.",Jerry who?,Gergich.,"Jeroh, Jerry.","Jerry, why are you calling me?",I don't want to waste my international minutes.,"Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee.",Everyone saw it.,"What do you mean, ""everyone""?","I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced.","She's calling it the ""Peepeehead"" speech.","Bloody hell, Jerry!",So how's Lond I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.,It's a very special day.,Okay.,"Hi, Donna.",So You're pregnant.,"Oh, man, Tom told you.",Nope.,"You're drinking decaf coffee, which you usually only do in the afternoon, you're wearing an empirewaist dress and loose shoes 'cause your feet are already swelling.","I'd put you at nine, maybe ten weeks.","My goodness, you're observant.","Yes, I am.","Yes, I am.",Hmm.,When did you make the switch to boxer briefs?,Yesterday.,"Okay, please stop looking at him.",Why are we here?,"Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism.","You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not.",Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.,"Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here.","When your kid screams ""I hate you,"" you don't sink to his level and yell ""I hate you"" back.",You have to be the grownup.,You're right.,I know.,I have to be the grownup.,But it's so hard!,Ron!,God!,And nobody ever thanks you.,"You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you.","And by the way, April thanked you.",She nominated you for this award.,"Well, April does that all the time.",She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.,"April respects you, and so do many others.",Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.,That way lies madness.,"Oh, I almost forgot.","I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many.",A train ticket?,You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent?,"Yes, you do.","If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.","Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen?","This is London, Ron.","There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops.","Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first.","Hey, Jerry.",I didn't know you were working today.,"Yeah, Ron asked me to come in while he's away.","Of course, I had to cancel my cardiologist appoint That's great.","Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting.","Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby.","Oh, my God, that's wonderful news!","Oh, there's so much in front of you.","I mean, soon you're gonna start showing, and then your clothes will feel tight, and then, oh, people are gonna start rubbing your tummy all the time!",That sounds terrible.,"Well, Gayle, she got really queasy, and I gained a lot of sympathy weight.",Yeah.,"You know, actually, before my kids, I looked a lot like you, Chris.",I'm very sad.,Please stop talking.,"And, of course, pretty soon, Ann, your milk is gonna come in.",Ohh.,That is exciting.,Mmm.,"Yep, and it happens sooner than you'd think.",The babies can sense it.,"You would be shocked, 'cause they are rooting around for that nipple.","Mm, mm.","Gimme, gimme.","Mm, mm, mm.",I want milk!,"Mm, mm, mm, mm.",Ohh.,Life is a miracle.,"Mm, mm, mm.",So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.,"Yeah, I guess.","I mean, I can't do it, obviously.",Why?,I don't even know what I would be doing.,"I mean, besides, this is England.",Everything is so weird.,It's all different.,"Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road.",Do they?,I'll be damned.,"Yeah, like that.",That's what I'm exactly what I'm talking about.,Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to?,Not even a circus.,"There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns.",One bearded lady.,She got all rude when I marveled at her.,Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy?,"Oh, he's awesome.",He's everything you would want in a boss.,"I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny.",Total package.,I think you should do it.,When are you gonna have another opportunity like this?,"I mean  And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay?","Remember, I was in Washington last year.", He said he wanted me to head up the company., I have no idea how to run a nonprofit., Hey., You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.," Come on, you can hack this.", I believe in you.," But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies.", Seems like the only logical solution.," My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant.", And I'm the baby daddy! How wonderful for you., You don't seem very excited for us.," I barely know you, and I don't have to talk to you unless it's about work."," Man, I thought this would be more satisfying.", I agree.," Wait a minute, what time is it? Has she landed yet? Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days."," This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race."," I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go.", I am not gonna let you go.," Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work."," Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods.", That's for a hangover.," Right, yeah, of course.", I'm so goofed-up right now., I'm so jet-lagged.," I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called ""Zapvigil,"" which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake."," So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab."," Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding.", I know it's Ann., We are so glad you're back.," We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for."," And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones.", - Ohh.," - Anyway, welcome home! Don't pinch me! Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting.", It's really a dream come true.," Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say."," Tom, lawyer guy daddy Tom did not screw me out of the company."," He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening."," So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened? Daddy-D! Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time! All those math camps I said I went to? I don't even know what a math camp is! So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won  Trophies I bought I also have something to say."," I have done nothing wrong, ever, in my life.", I know this and I love you.," I love you too, daddy."," Money, please! My money.", Dr.," Saperstein, your son is my best friend.", - Yeah., - He's like a brother to me.," But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum.", - Mm., - On an island - Ooh., - In space.,  Hold on These two have been huge disappointments to me.," Come on, you love us."," Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets."," Dad! Me, me, me, me, me, me, me! But seriously, what are we doing here, though? - What are we doing here, dad? - Like, what is this? - Why are we here? - So So now you know the truth."," Will you back off? No, I will not stop."," Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now."," Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time? No, I'm not gonna back off."," I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you! All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night? - Yes! - Yes, daddy.", Huh? Blow me a kiss., Mwah! - Mwah., - Caught it.," I love you, daddy! - Me too."," - I love you, daddy! Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone? Yeah, we'll be fine.", Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here? - April - What? I don't trust him., I never have., - He's after your money.," - Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope."," And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy."," Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia."," Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world."," Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs."," You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away.", Isn't that great? I didn't want all the slugs gone., I wanted most of them gone! Sorry.," Well, we'll put one slug back."," Either way, your problem is solved."," Oh, my God, that lady is the worst.", She didn't even say thank you.," That's not why we do this, April."," We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause."," Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out? Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all.", But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs., All right., On to the next complaint.," Where the hell are you sending me, Knope? Morning, cutie."," Morning, Jessica.", Whoa.," These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington.", He was very impressed with you two., He sounded rich on the phone., I think he was calling me from a helicopter., Could be., He owns two., So Andy's gonna stay there for three months., I hope he's okay., He sent me an email this morning., I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.," Yeah, this isn't right.", None of this looks familiar.," Eddie? Uh-oh, Spaghettios."," Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust."," No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase."," Oh, my.", Okay.," Come on, Sugarbutt! Oh, which one's Sugarbutt? That's you! Come on."," We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt.", Wildly inappropriate., Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up? I doubt it.," He never gives up on anything, except for my mom."," When she turned 30, he was like, ""Get out!"" Maybe I should just throw in the towel.", Your dad'll destroy me., I'll be left with nothing., Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg., Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.," First of all, unbelievable analogy."," Second of all, what are you talking about, man? You're Tommy Haverford! You're an idea man."," When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher.", You're right.," I mean, I'm basically Babyface."," You're basically Babyface! Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad."," That's what I'm talking about! And for me, it's a win-win either way."," Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies.", I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.," - You want to come? - No! I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know? You know what I just read? Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive.", Isn't that wild? It is., A green olive., A little high in sodium., I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato., - Our baby's not a salad.," - Yes, right."," It's just weird, you know? I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing."," Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs.", It's still just our thing., It'll always be just our thing., That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.," You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl."," I prefer ""Chickpea.",""" Because it's lower in sodium? - Yes, exactly.", - Okay., - Hey., - Hey.," Are you leaving? Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase."," Let's see, it is ""48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon.",""" Oh, brother."," Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you."," I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours."," So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face.", - Okay? - Okay., Please sit.," ""Dear award committee members"" Leslie, I didn't even start."," Okay, I'm sorry.", Go ahead.," ""Dear award committee members, ""where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, ""people who don't care at all about what they do ""or how they do it."," ""They let the world wash over them ""and barely notice anyone else is even there."," ""Leslie Knope is not one of these people."," ""She cares about everything and everyone in our town."," ""I don't know how she does it."," ""People come to her with the pettiest, ""stupidest problems, ""and she cares-- like, really, actually cares-- ""what happens to them."," ""And if you're lucky enough to be her friend, ""your life gets better every day."," ""She spends every waking moment thinking ""of new ways to make her friends happy."," ""There is something wonderful about seeing someone ""who has found her true purpose on earth."," ""For some people, I guess that's being an astronaut ""or a hot dog-eating champion."," ""For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, ""is making people's lives better."," ""That's what I love about her, ""and that's why she deserves this award."," ""Sincerely Satan.",""" You're getting hugged right now."," No, I told you not to.", - I'm giving you a hug., - No! Stay away! No! All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.," But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption.", This is worth the trip.," ""Dear Ron, ""you have now reached the cliffsides ""overlooking the islands."," ""As you sit here and gaze upon the waters, ""please read out loud the poem ""by the great Scotsman Robert Burns."," Love, Leslie.",""" ""Oh, were my love yon lilac fair, ""with purple blossoms to the spring, ""and I, a bird to shelter there, ""when wearied on my little wing, ""how I would mourn when it was torn ""by autumn wild and winter rude, ""but I would sing on wanton wing, when youthful may its bloom renewed.",""" I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.", - Nice to be home., - It is.," But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing."," And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing.", Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.," Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it."," Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons."," You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts."," We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us.", Yeah.," Oh, there's one more thing I want to try.", Mm., I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig., - Oh., - Wear it for me., - Yeah? - Mm-hmm., All right.," What's up? No, not sexy.", Failed experiment., Take it off.," - Okay, just--okay.", - Just take it off., No.,   ,"

them.,"Hello, darling, what a surprise.",Hey.,Can we talk?,Maybe in private.,You and me?,"I believe she's referring to me, son.",Please excuse us.,So Iam pregnant.,I see.,I don't understand how.,We were so careful.,I warned you about this.,Standard birth control methods aren't usually effective against a Swanson.,"I got about a million thoughts running around in my head, but I really just want to know what you're thinking.","Okay, here's what I'm thinking.","I was gonna wait until our anniversary, take you somewhere romantic, perhaps in a canoe most likely in a canoe.","I actually built a canoe for that purpose, but given the news, and given my significant feelings for you, now seems as good a time as any.",Ron Swanson.,Diane Lewis will you marry me?,Yes.,On one condition.,"Anything, my love.","Ask me for anything in the world, and I'll give it to you, except a destination wedding.",Just the opposite.,We've both been married before.,I don't want anything big or elaborate.,"In fact, the smaller the better.",I assume you can deal with that.,Are you kidding?,"As far as I'm concerned, we could go up to the fourth floor right now.","Well, hello there.","Hey, Leslie.",What's with the getup?,We're coming back from cleaning up the Pawnee River.,There's nothing I love more than squeegeeing slime off a highway underpass.,Where are you guys going?,"The fourth floor, getting married.",Okeydokey.,"Well, catch you later.",What?,Wha Whatwho's what the Are you dead?,You look like you're in rictus.,I justI'm having so many thoughts and feelings that I'm paralyzed right now.,Would you ladies like to come?,Can I be the best man?,Why not?,Let's go.,"Ron is getting married, and I love him, and I care about him, and this is the greatest day ever, and I do not have time to talk about this!",Wait!,"If you would just slow down a little, then I could arrange balloons or a flower cake  or a bouncy castle  Ah!","Ethel Beavers, we would like a marriage license, please and thank you.",What's the date of the wedding?,Today.,"It's a bit unusual,  but we both  Don't care.","Leslie Knope, would you please be my matron of honor?","Diane, you have no idea what that means to me.",She gets it.,Let's go.,"Well, this is like a waking nightmare of happiness.",I need to get some flowers.,Why don't you hold this colorful bouquet of highlighters?,"Rice, I need to find some rice, I need to throw some rice.",Why is there no rice in this municipal government building?,I found a justice guy.,These are the marrying people.,This is Carl.,"Hello, Carl.","My fiancee and I would like to get married right now, right here.",Haven't I done a quickie wedding for you before?,"It's certainly possible, but this one's going to stick.",I need your full names for the license.,Ronald Ulysses Swanson.,Diane Tammy Lewis.,Tammy?,"Your middle name is  Just kidding, it's Elizabeth.","Let's go, Carl.","Hey, hey.","Let's pump the brakes, Carl, okay?","Belay that order, Carl.",Shortest possible ceremony.,I'm tired of not being married to this woman.,"Do you, Ron Swanson, take Diane to be your wife?","Ooh, it's going to start!","Ooh, it's happening!",I certainly do.,"Oh, my God!","And do you, Diane, take  Yes!","Yes, I do.",She said yes!,Okay.,Wait!,"By the power vested in me  Before you Carl, just one second.","I would just like to give a short speech, if I may.",You have ten seconds.,"At first glance, it may seem as though Ron Swanson and I have nothing in common, but Webster's dictionary defines ""friend""  Time.",It'sugh!,"Thank you, Leslie.","I could tell where you were going with that, and it was gonna be beautiful.",I now pronounce you  Oh!,man and wife.,Hooray!,Yay!,"Great job, everyone.","The reception will be held in each of our individual houses, alone.",Pretend this is rice!,That was beautiful.,The people who want to boot me from office have been viciously attacking me for weeks.,Recall Knope!,Recall Knope!,Legalize weed!,"Last week, I was an answer in the Pawnee Journal's Crossword Puzzle.","The clue""Who's the worst,"" but you know what?",We're fighting back.,I've broken my defense initiative into 40 phases.,"We are currently in phase 26: ""No problem too small.",""" Anyone can come to me any time with any problem, no matter how petty or small, and I will fix it personally, and let me tell you, some of these complaints are pretty damn petty and small.","Okay, Gretel, how can I help you today?",There are slugs everywhere on the sidewalk in front of my house.,I want them gone but not killedI love animals.,But get rid of them.,They're gross.,But make sure they're happy but not too happy.,"Well, we're on it, because ""No problem too small.",""" So what now?","Well, I have about 30 more people who want to come into my office and complain to my face.",Leslie Knope!,Oh!,Ann Perkins.,Mm.,How's the recall fight going?,This persontoperson campaigning is kind of wearing me down.,"Well, as a wise woman once said to me, ""Ann, you cunning, pliable, chestnuthaired sunfish, phase 26 is the key to my plan.",""" Good memory, sunfish.",Let's press on.,I have to come up with some solution for this slug problem.,Someone has a slug infestation?,"Boy, oh, boy, we live interesting lives, filled with unexpected challenges.","Life is precious, and every day is a miracle.",Okay.,What a freak.,Things with me and Chris are going really well.,"We spend every day together, and we're having so much fun.",And check this out.,"Oh, no, there's no ring.",We just had manicures together recently.,"Sorry, that was misleading.","Ah, Mr.","Haverford, back again, I see.","What the hell, man?",This looks exactly like my store!,I know.,My client is a very determined businessman.,"When he rips someone off, he goes all the way.","You see, you are Hydrox, Mr.",Haverford.,We are Oreo.,"Your mysterious, unnamed client seems like a pretty intense guy.",I am impressed by how quickly he was able to move such a large amount of merchandise.,Mm.,He must be one heck of a transporter.,"My client is not Jason Statham, if that's what you're thinking.",Some mysterious big shot investor has opened up a store directly across the street from rentaswag to try to put me out of business.,"I'm not worried, though.",I've poured my heart and soul into my store.,I'm sure this guy's just looking for a place to store all his NBA championship trophies.,It's not Lebron James.,Damn.,"Well, I hate to say this, gang, but I don't think ""No problem too small"" is working.","I mean, there's been no press coverage, no change in my poll numbers.","I agree, we need something massive and attentiongetting, something that will grab people by the ears, yell at them through a bullhorn, and hit them like a bolt of lightning.",I got it!,What is it?,"Oh, no, I just I got a fly.",I have something.,"Remember phase 13, ""Think outside of the box""?",Of course.,It was an amazing phase.,Easily a top five phase.,"Well, I thought outside of the box, and I nominated you for this big award.","It's called ""The International Coalition of Women in Government,"" and you won.","There's, like, five winners, and you get a big trophy or something.","Oh, my God, this is real.",I just assumed you were lying.,"Thank you, but yeah, it's real.","Ann Richards won it once, and Janet Napolitano, I think.",Janet Napolifrakingtano?,"Oh, my God.",This is amazing and perfect.,"This is exactly the kind of big, splashy thing that's gonna get the voters' attention.",When is the ceremony?,Next monthin London.,London?,London?,We're going to London?,"We're going to London, you guys!",I can't believe we're at Hogwarts!,"No, that's Buckingham Palace.",Hogwarts is fictional.,Do you know that?,It's important to me that you know that.,"Okay, guys, we are going to be sightseeing today.","Andy and Ben are gonna go to their meeting, and then we're gonna go back to the hotel for lunch, and I will spend the day getting to know London's history.","History began on July 4, 1776.",Everything before that was a mistake.,"Diane suggested we ""tag along to London"" for a honeymoon.","I agreed, because my love for her trumps my hatred for Europe.","Then she hit a phase of morning sickness that knocked her for a loop and decided to stay home, but she insisted I go and take pictures for her.","All of this could have been avoided if we'd followed my plan for a honeymoon: a steak dinner, a glass of Lagavulin whiskey, then vigorous lovemaking for two hours, and we're both asleep by 8:30.","Hey, Leslie, we're gonna head to the meeting.",Are you okay?,"Yeah, I know it's weird, but I kind of feel bad about leaving Pawnee.",It's like leaving my kid at home without a babysitter.,"Leslie, you're in London.","You're 4,000 miles away from home.","Try to enjoy this, okay?","Yeah, you're right, as usual.",Good luck.,"Ooh, hey boss man, I want to go home early.","Ooh, hold on, actually.",Hang on.,"Yeah, no.",I want to quit and never come here again.,"Okay, bye.",I can't believe I used to date you!,Tommy Pickles!,You see there's a better version of your store across the street?,"And those guys are giving out free pizza with ""papperonas.",""" I know, man.",That's my competition.,"They're trying to put me out of business, and it's working.","Three weeks ago, this place was hopping.",My clothes were flying off the rack.,I was spreading swag around town like a killer swag virus.,"Now, look at this place.",It's dead!,What am I gonna do?,"It's like I always say, okay?","When life gives you lemons, you sell some of your grandma's jewelry, and you go clubbing.",That's not a good piece of advice.,So I'ma throw up.,I ate too much cheese.,I'll talk to you!,I need some better friends.,So the only thing you did was stop drinking beer?,"Yeah, I lost 50 pounds in one month.",How much beer were you drinking?,"I know, right?",Probably too much.,"Andy and I are meeting with an English charity foundation to expand our afterschool music program, and British people love me.","There was this British kid in my high school who always called me ""Big Ben"" and would punch me really hard on the arm, and go, ""Bong!",Bong!,"Bo"" Oh, he might have hated me.","Real quick, should I do a British accent?","Um, I'm gonna say no.",You sure?,Yeah.,I can do one.,"It's not very good, but I think I could pull it off.",I just feel like he's gonna get upset when he finds out that we're American.,He knows we're American.,"Ugh, great.","All right, well, I guess we'll take the meeting anyway.","After all, we did come all the way down under.",No.,"Lord Covington, I'm Ben Wyatt.","This is Andy Dwyer, and it is an honor to meet you, sir.","Well, it's nice to meet you too.","However, the proper mode of address would be ""Your Royal Excellency, Lord Edgar Darby Covington, ""14th Earl of CornwalluponThames, of Hertfordshire.",""" No, no, no, I'm kidding.",I'm kidding.,Oh!,"Please, call me Eddie.","Oh, thank God.",I knew that other name must have been a stupid joke.,"Andy No, no, no, no, he's absolutely right, it's an absurd name.","Well, I'm excited to hear about your musical charity idea.",Shall we?,Yeah.,"The Notting Hill bus tour starts at 2:00, the Love Actually bus tour starts at 2:30, andoh, the Bridget Jones bus tour starts at 2:30 also.",What do we do?,"Ron, your pick.","Look, a clock.",We don't have that in America.,You call that a tower?,"Try the Sears Tower, friend.","""London at night.",""" That is very funny.","Can I help you, sir?",Yes.,I will take this.,"We don't accept American currency, sir.",Of course you do.,That's the most wonderful piece of paper in the world.,Accept it.,"Very sorry, sir.",Fine.,"Enjoy the fact that your royal overlords are a frail, old woman and a tiny baby.","You really think this will work, Donna?",Why wouldn't it?,We just pull the business license it's public information and then at least you'll have an address.,"Ooh, here.","Hmm, some kind of shady, fake shell corporation  called ""Open 4 Business, LLC.","""  Thanks, Donna.","Hey, if it's Akon and y'all become best friends, I want a ride on his plane.",Done and done.,Nice.,"""1020 Maple Street.",""" Ann and Chris?",What are they doing here?,"Sir, you can't go in there!",Aha!,I caught you!,"Hey, it's Tom!",What the hell are you doing?,What am I doing?,What are you doing here?,Dr.,"Saperstein is giving me a sonogram, in his doctor's office, for women, because I'm pregnant!","Oh, my God.",You're JeanRalphio's dad!,Mmhmm.,You're the one that's trying to put me out of business!,"Well, look at that, Mr.",Haverford.,You tracked me down.,"Looks like your detective skills are a lot better than your tween, highend fashion rental skills.","Ann, Chris, can we have the room, please?","No, you certainly cannot.",Dr.,"Saperstein, why are you doing this?",What did I ever do to you?,You know exactly why I'm doing this.,You destroyed my family.,"First, you screwed my son out of your business, and then you stole my daughter's virginity.","Wait, you're serious?",Deadly serious.,"According to my daughter, you broke her heart.",Then you smashed up her BMW.,"I had to buy her a new one, so she could drive to Divinity School.","Let me tell you something, mister.","You attack a Saperstein, you face my wrath.","Be so sure about this, Tiny Tom, that I will crush you like the bug you are And there it is, the heartbeat.",Ohh.,Everything sounds perfect.,Ohh.,This is the moment we were dreaming of: you and me and our baby.,And Tom and his weird feud with our doctor.,"So this afterschool music program has been really successful in Pawnee, and we've expanded it to eight other towns in Indiana, but we feel with your help, we can Whoa!",Are those I'm sorry.,I'm sorry.,Are those remote control helicopters?,Yeah.,What?,I got them as a gift.,"I bought them for one of my nephews,  and then I decided to keep them.",Yeah.,Would you like to play with them?,"Oh, would I?",I call blue one!,I call the oh.,"Okay, you get the blue one.","Andy, we are guests of Lord Covington.",Maybe you should let him play with the blue helicopter.,"What are you talking about, dude?",I called it.,He called it.,That's the rule.,That's the rule.,"Anyway, the orange one's better.",What?,Come on.,Aah!,"Hey, get off!","Okay, watch out!",Watch out!,Agh!,Ohh!,"Dude, awesome.",I think I broke mine!,"Oh, bummer.","So, like, you your family owns all this stuff?","Well, no, not everything.","We own that building, that one, that house, that round thing, that one.",We don't own that.,"Oh, no, actually, we do own that.",What else does your family own?,"Well, um, have you heard of Scotland?","As I was saying, we've really made this music program work in Indiana, and we think, with your help, we could turn this into a widereaching international program.","Oh, you know what I want?",Ice cream.,"Do you guys have that here, ice cream?","Oh, it's so good.",You have to get it.,"It's, like, scoops, and it comes on a cone.",Yeah.,Do you have that here?,We have it.,Of course we  You have it?,"Where do you think you are, the moon?",That'd be awesome if we were.,Yeah.,Can we get some?,Could we docould we have some?,Could we?,Sure.,Yeah.,Let's go.,Just what do I do with this?,Just throw it there.,Roger will pick it up.,Oh.,"""So I long for a

think you should lose the first line and the last line and all of the other lines, and instead, just walk up to the mic and meow really loudly for eight minutes.","Okay, this trip is amazing, but I miss Pawnee, you know?",I want to know what's happening there.,One little news blast wouldn't hurt.,Welcome to The Final Word With Perd.,Ms.,"Pinewood, there is a thing you are doing, and that thing is you are leading a recall vote against Councilwoman Knope, and you say you have new, shocking allegations about her.",What?,What now?,"Perd, I take no pleasure in reporting this, but it must come to light.","We are here, trying to make Pawnee better, and where is Leslie Knope?",She's gallivanting around Europe like some kind of European.,Howhow did they get that picture so Facebook.,But I just put  Facebook.,But isn't it a  Facebook.,"Apparently, she can't be bothered to stay here in Pawnee, not when there's Europe to gallivant around in.","Well, we conducted a Perd poll and asked this question: not be in Europe, and 35% said they were confused by the way the question was posed.","Oh, my God.",You're leaving tonight?,I can't believe there's even a flight?,"Well, not to Indiana, but there's a 9:00 redeye to Lisbon, and then I can catch the 4:30 A.",M.,"back to Edinburgh, connect through Houston, head on up to Cincinnati and then rent a car, drive around 90, and I'll be home two hours earlier than if I flew home as planned.",Easy breezy!,"Leslie, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I do not think you should leave Europe right now.",You flew all this way.,Have some perspective.,You have some perspective!,I'm sorry.,Maybe you're right.,Maybe I'm stressed.,"Okay, I need to calm down.",Let's go walk past Colin Firth's house again.,"Ugh, who is that?",Hold up.,My dad said that?,"Yeah, JeanRalphio.",He told me that I had screwed you  out of my business  What?,So he was gonna screw me back.,Any idea why he'd believe such a thing?,That is so weird.,"That is so oh, you know what?","Honestly, now that I'm thinking about it, this may be it.",I actually told him that RentASwag was my idea and that you had stole it from me.,Why would you say that?,"Because my dad is always riding me for never having a job, and I just didn't want to show that I blew it again.",Ohand I don't know if this is relevant  Hmm.,But I told him that you made me sign up for a bunch of credit cards and then max them out by buying illegal white jaguar fur coats.,"That's probably not relevant, though.","It's probably not relevant, though.",I don't know  I guess All this lying about me stops now!,Hmm.,This is my life.,"Please, one of you has to tell him the truth.",Not it!,Not it!,"Ooh, you got me!",Whoa ho!,"Uhoh, uhoh!","Uhoh, uhoh, uhoh.",Uhoh.,"Okay, fine.",You know what?,I'm gonna do the unthinkable.,"I'm gonna have a short, honest conversation with my father.",Thank you.,"Oh, that's a big cheering section.","Okay, that's Khongordzol, from Mongolia.","She grew up in a hut that was entirely made of ice and mud, then she became their mayor, then their police chief and their best Wolverine Wrangler.",I love her.,"Oh, hi.",You must be Leslie Knope.,I'm Ulee Danssen.,I'm one of the honorees.,"Wow, look at your face.",What?,It's just so symmetrical.,"Oh, thanks!","You know, we all have that in Denmark.","Oh, you're from Denmark, of course.","Wow, what part of Denmark are you from?",I'm from Silkeborg.,You know.,"It's not one of the most perfect places in the world, but I love it, and it loves me.",And look what they've done for me.,They made a statue of you!,Yes.,Wow.,Is that goat cheese?,"Good cheese eye, Leslie.",It is made out of goat cheese.,"We have a lot of it, and after tonight's event, they're going to consume me with crackers.",They just love me.,What about your town?,"Well, Pawnee, Indiana, is a wonderful town, and I love it, but they hate me.",And they're trying to kick me out of office.,"One time, they made a pinata of my face, and then everybody in the town came and took turns hitting it with a stick, and they filled it with broccoli, just to add insult to injury but politics you know what I mean, right?","I don't, no.",So you're from Mongolia?,Will you take me with you when you go back there?,I love you.,Hmm.,Did you understand that?,Did you bring any wolverines?,Say it again.,Say it again.,Aluminium.,"Okay, okay.",You say it.,You say it.,You say it.,"It's ""alumilum.","""  ""Alumilum""?",Okay.,Alumilum!,"Uh, Eddie if you'd like me to talk more about the program,  I would be happy to  Mmhmm.","But my wife is receiving an award in just a few minutes, and I really need to get over there.","Yes, of course.","The thing is, I don't know what I'm doing.",Me neither.,I'm sorry?,My family has a huge amount of money.,"We live in a castle that has 1,000 acres of land.","Our hedge maze is so vast, once, I got lost in there for two days.",What?,That's awesome.,It was awesome.,"There was a statue of a lion inside, and I found a yoyo.","Well, do you do you have it here?","Guys  The point is, I started this foundation in order to do something good with our money, and I've heard hundreds of charity pitches, and I honestly don't know whether they're good or bad.","If I may, ours is great.",Brilliant!,I'm in.,What?,Are you serious?,Yeah.,"I like you, I like music.","On one condition: I want you to stay here in London with me for no more than three months, to help me get it up and running and tell me what to do.","Oh, well, that actually may be tough.","I mean, my wife is in the middle of this recall fight, and I really need to Oh, no, no, no, no, no.","No, no, I meant Andy.",I want Andy to stay.,Is that a goose that just flew by the window?,"Oh, it's a plastic bag.",Did you see that?,"Wait, did I interrupt?",What are you guys talking about?,Let's see if it was a goose.,"I think it could have been, honest to God.","Silkeborg is wonderful, and I am very supported and loved.","Once, on my birthday, the town trained a reindeer to do a dance for me.","It was beautiful, and the reindeer was delicious.",Hey.,Hey!,How was your meeting?,Good.,I'll fill you in later.,Are you ready for your speech?,Uhyeah.,Yeah.,"Thank you, Ulee.",It is so inspiring to hear stories of powerful women who are held in high esteem by their hometowns.,"Now, from the hometown of Pawnee, Indiana, in the United States, Leslie Knope.","First let me say, it is a true honor to be here among these amazing women.",You all inspire me with your accomplishments and the things you have done for your hometowns and the things your hometowns have done for you.,"I mean, they're just truly You know, I've been a public servant for a long time.",And you know how I spend my days?,Cleaning slime out of rivers and removing slugs from people's front yards.,"And I love my town, but you know how they repay me?",By hating me.,They hate me.,They want to recall me.,I wish I could move to Silkeborg and dance with a reindeer.,You're always welcome in Silkeborg!,"Olga, let's start a statue of Leslie.",See?,"They like me in Silkeborg more than my own hometown, and I've never even been there.","I love Pawnee, but sometimes it sucks.","The people can be very mean and ungrateful, and they cling to their fried dough and their big sodas, and then they get mad at me when their pants don't fit.","You know, I'm sick of it.",Pawnee is filled with a bunch of peepeeheads.,Thank you very much for this amazing award.,"I'm sorry I said ""peepeeheads.",""" Whoo!",That's my boss!,"That speech was a little rough, don't you think?","Whatever, it's how I feel.","Stupid, ungrateful town.","Plus, you said it yourself: We're 4,000 miles away.",Hello.,"Leslie, it's Jerry.",Jerry who?,Gergich.,"Jeroh, Jerry.","Jerry, why are you calling me?",I don't want to waste my international minutes.,"Leslie, your speech was webcast, here in Pawnee.",Everyone saw it.,"What do you mean, ""everyone""?","I had organized a big viewing party, you know, to support you, and, well, now that Kathryn Pinewood lady, she's already pounced.","She's calling it the ""Peepeehead"" speech.","Bloody hell, Jerry!",So how's Lond I just never thought that I would get to make this announcement.,It's a very special day.,Okay.,"Hi, Donna.",So You're pregnant.,"Oh, man, Tom told you.",Nope.,"You're drinking decaf coffee, which you usually only do in the afternoon, you're wearing an empirewaist dress and loose shoes 'cause your feet are already swelling.","I'd put you at nine, maybe ten weeks.","My goodness, you're observant.","Yes, I am.","Yes, I am.",Hmm.,When did you make the switch to boxer briefs?,Yesterday.,"Okay, please stop looking at him.",Why are we here?,"Just thought you needed some fresh air, even if that air is filled with the foul stench of European socialism.","You know, I know I am supposed to feel bad about what I said, but I do not.",Pawnee has really been pissing me off lately.,"Leslie, for God's sake, you're the adult here.","When your kid screams ""I hate you,"" you don't sink to his level and yell ""I hate you"" back.",You have to be the grownup.,You're right.,I know.,I have to be the grownup.,But it's so hard!,Ron!,God!,And nobody ever thanks you.,"You choose a thankless job, you can't be upset when nobody thanks you.","And by the way, April thanked you.",She nominated you for this award.,"Well, April does that all the time.",She nominated Ann for Motocross Driver of the Year award just so she could get a rejection letter.,"April respects you, and so do many others.",Don't start chasing applause and acclaim.,That way lies madness.,"Oh, I almost forgot.","I finally got you a proper wedding gift, part one of many.",A train ticket?,You think I want to extend my stay on this godforsaken continent?,"Yes, you do.","If you follow that itinerary to the letter, I promise you, you will not be disappointed.","Well, I would offer to buy you a drink, but where the hell would that even happen?","This is London, Ron.","There's a pub over there, there's a pub over there, there's a pub between those two butcher shops.","Let's go to that one, but we'll be stopping in those two butcher shops first.","Hey, Jerry.",I didn't know you were working today.,"Yeah, Ron asked me to come in while he's away.","Of course, I had to cancel my cardiologist appoint That's great.","Now, here's a piece of information that is interesting.","Ann is pregnant, and it's my baby.","Oh, my God, that's wonderful news!","Oh, there's so much in front of you.","I mean, soon you're gonna start showing, and then your clothes will feel tight, and then, oh, people are gonna start rubbing your tummy all the time!",That sounds terrible.,"Well, Gayle, she got really queasy, and I gained a lot of sympathy weight.",Yeah.,"You know, actually, before my kids, I looked a lot like you, Chris.",I'm very sad.,Please stop talking.,"And, of course, pretty soon, Ann, your milk is gonna come in.",Ohh.,That is exciting.,Mmm.,"Yep, and it happens sooner than you'd think.",The babies can sense it.,"You would be shocked, 'cause they are rooting around for that nipple.","Mm, mm.","Gimme, gimme.","Mm, mm, mm.",I want milk!,"Mm, mm, mm, mm.",Ohh.,Life is a miracle.,"Mm, mm, mm.",So it's kind of awesome that the Lord Fancyface Guy wants you to stay.,"Yeah, I guess.","I mean, I can't do it, obviously.",Why?,I don't even know what I would be doing.,"I mean, besides, this is England.",Everything is so weird.,It's all different.,"Yeah, like how they drive on the other side of the road.",Do they?,I'll be damned.,"Yeah, like that.",That's what I'm exactly what I'm talking about.,Or like the Piccadilly Circus we went to?,Not even a circus.,"There's no elephants, there was no cotton candy, there's no clowns.",One bearded lady.,She got all rude when I marveled at her.,Do you like the Lord Fancyface Guy?,"Oh, he's awesome.",He's everything you would want in a boss.,"I mean, remote control helicopters, talks funny.",Total package.,I think you should do it.,When are you gonna have another opportunity like this?,"I mean  And, plus, we can deal with the distance, okay?","Remember, I was in Washington last year.", He said he wanted me to head up the company., I have no idea how to run a nonprofit., Hey., You shined shoes for over two years and never made a profit.," Come on, you can hack this.", I believe in you.," But to replace you, I am going to have to build a scarecrow replica of you and take it to the movies.", Seems like the only logical solution.," My point is, Ethel, that Ann's pregnant.", And I'm the baby daddy! How wonderful for you., You don't seem very excited for us.," I barely know you, and I don't have to talk to you unless it's about work."," Man, I thought this would be more satisfying.", I agree.," Wait a minute, what time is it? Has she landed yet? Oh, I'm so happy for you guys! Ohh, this is the greatest day in the history of days."," This day, a thousand years from now, will be celebrated as the beginning of a new and better human race."," I am so happy for you, I'm never letting you go.", I am not gonna let you go.," Oh, oh, oh, eventually, she's going to have to go back to work."," Are you sure you should be working? I mean, you should be resting and getting fluids and-- and cold compresses and greasy foods.", That's for a hangover.," Right, yeah, of course.", I'm so goofed-up right now., I'm so jet-lagged.," I took a sleeping pill on the plane, and then I changed my mind, so I took this thing called ""Zapvigil,"" which, apparently, is what Israeli fighter pilots use to stay awake."," So right now, it looks like I'm talking to a giant crab."," Stay away from me, crab! I'm just kidding.", I know it's Ann., We are so glad you're back.," We talked to, like, 50 people, and, frankly, not one of them gave us the reaction that we were hoping for."," And your reaction, from someone we love so much, I mean, it just makes up for all the other ones.", - Ohh.," - Anyway, welcome home! Don't pinch me! Thank you all for coming, and let me just say how truly, deeply trill it is to be standing in this dope-ass conference room, addressing a group of people in a business meeting.", It's really a dream come true.," Right now, I want to turn the floor over to Jean-Ralphio, who has something to say."," Tom, lawyer guy daddy Tom did not screw me out of the company."," He gave me every opportunity to jump in at the ground floor, and I said no, not because I thought it was a bad idea, but because-- and this is very important-- I really didn't care about what was happening."," So why, exactly, did you lie when I asked you what had happened? Daddy-D! Daddy, come on, I lie to you all the time! All those math camps I said I went to? I don't even know what a math camp is! So all those postcards that you sent me, all those trophies that you'd won  Trophies I bought I also have something to say."," I have done nothing wrong, ever, in my life.", I know this and I love you.," I love you too, daddy."," Money, please! My money.", Dr.," Saperstein, your son is my best friend.", - Yeah., - He's like a brother to me.," But he's a disaster, and your daughter seriously needs to be locked up in some sort of insane asylum.", - Mm., - On an island - Ooh., - In space.,  Hold on These two have been huge disappointments to me.," Come on, you love us."," Tell me you love us, and then admit this guy looks like Beaker from the Muppets."," Dad! Me, me, me, me, me, me, me! But seriously, what are we doing here, though? - What are we doing here, dad? - Like, what is this? - Why are we here? - So So now you know the truth."," Will you back off? No, I will not stop."," Yes, this all started as vengeance for my children, but the company is making money now."," Why would I back off just 'cause these nincompoops lie to me all the time? No, I'm not gonna back off."," I'm gonna continue, and I'm gonna crush you! All right, you two, are you in for dinner tomorrow night? - Yes! - Yes, daddy.", Huh? Blow me a kiss., Mwah! - Mwah., - Caught it.," I love you, daddy! - Me too."," - I love you, daddy! Hey, are you gonna be okay with Andy gone? Yeah, we'll be fine.", Are you gonna be okay with Ben still here? - April - What? I don't trust him., I never have., - He's after your money.," - Hey, Gretel! Hello, it's me, City Councilwoman Leslie Knope."," And me, Odie the dog, Garfield's enemy."," Now, we have some great news: we were in London, and we met a wonderful woman from Mongolia."," Yeah, her name was Khongordzol, and I love her more than anything in the world."," Khongordzol and Odie, here, were emailing, and she recommended a very humane way to get rid of slugs."," You sprinkle coffee grounds on the affected area, and it drives the slugs away.", Isn't that great? I didn't want all the slugs gone., I wanted most of them gone! Sorry.," Well, we'll put one slug back."," Either way, your problem is solved."," Oh, my God, that lady is the worst.", She didn't even say thank you.," That's not why we do this, April."," We do it because it's good and it helps people, not to get the applause."," Yeah, but doesn't that bum you out? Well, sure, it would be nice if just one person appreciated my work, at all.", But that's the job-- wiping slime and shoveling slugs., All right., On to the next complaint.," Where the hell are you sending me, Knope? Morning, cutie."," Morning, Jessica.", Whoa.," These were a gift from your British friend, Lord Edgar Covington.", He was very impressed with you two., He sounded rich on the phone., I think he was calling me from a helicopter., Could be., He owns two., So Andy's gonna stay there for three months., I hope he's okay., He sent me an email this morning., I guess he got on the wrong train on the way to work and got lost.," Yeah, this isn't right.", None of this looks familiar.," Eddie? Uh-oh, Spaghettios."," Oh, don't worry, I'm sure he'll adjust."," No, I named that dog Spaghettios, and he just pooped in your briefcase."," Oh, my.", Okay.," Come on, Sugarbutt! Oh, which one's Sugarbutt? That's you! Come on."," We got a board meeting, Sugarbutt.", Wildly inappropriate., Do you think there's any chance your dad will give up? I doubt it.," He never gives up on anything, except for my mom."," When she turned 30, he was like, ""Get out!"" Maybe I should just throw in the towel.", Your dad'll destroy me., I'll be left with nothing., Thought I was a better-looking version of Zuckerberg., Turns out I'm the better-looking version of the Winklevoss twins.," First of all, unbelievable analogy."," Second of all, what are you talking about, man? You're Tommy Haverford! You're an idea man."," When Babyface was your age, he hadn't even signed Toni Braxton yet, let alone Usher.", You're right.," I mean, I'm basically Babyface."," You're basically Babyface! Okay, I'm gonna keep going, and I'm gonna beat your dad."," That's what I'm talking about! And for me, it's a win-win either way."," Either my best friend emerges triumphant, or my dad beats you, and I get all that money when he dies.", I'm actually getting dinner with my dad right now.," - You want to come? - No! I mean, this is all pretty overwhelming, you know? You know what I just read? Right now, our baby is the size of a green olive.", Isn't that wild? It is., A green olive., A little high in sodium., I would have preferred a chickpea or a cherry tomato., - Our baby's not a salad.," - Yes, right."," It's just weird, you know? I mean, for so long, this little green olive was just our thing, and now it's everyone's thing."," Every time Jerry looks at me, he's thinking about the milk in my boobs.", It's still just our thing., It'll always be just our thing., That's why it's so wonderful and why we'll love it so much.," You know, Olive's kind of a cute name, if it's a girl."," I prefer ""Chickpea.",""" Because it's lower in sodium? - Yes, exactly.", - Okay., - Hey., - Hey.," Are you leaving? Well, I just have to get a jump start on my next phase."," Let's see, it is ""48-Hour Roadkill Scrape-athon.",""" Oh, brother."," Okay, well, before you go, I have something for you."," I feel like you're getting sad about how stupid and lame people are, and that is my job, not yours."," So I'm gonna read this letter to you, out loud, but if you hug me afterwards, I swear to God, I'll scream and pull my hair out and maybe punch you in the face.", - Okay? - Okay., Please sit.," ""Dear award committee members"" Leslie, I didn't even start."," Okay, I'm sorry.", Go ahead.," ""Dear award committee members, ""where I live, there are a lot of apathetic people, ""people who don't care at all about what they do ""or how they do it."," ""They let the world wash over them ""and barely notice anyone else is even there."," ""Leslie Knope is not one of these people."," ""She cares about everything and everyone in our town."," ""I don't know how she does it."," ""People come to her with the pettiest, ""stupidest problems, ""and she cares-- like, really, actually cares-- ""what happens to them."," ""And if you're lucky enough to be her friend, ""your life gets better every day."," ""She spends every waking moment thinking ""of new ways to make her friends happy."," ""There is something wonderful about seeing someone ""who has found her true purpose on earth."," ""For some people, I guess that's being an astronaut ""or a hot dog-eating champion."," ""For Leslie, her true purpose on earth, her true meaning, ""is making people's lives better."," ""That's what I love about her, ""and that's why she deserves this award."," ""Sincerely Satan.",""" You're getting hugged right now."," No, I told you not to.", - I'm giving you a hug., - No! Stay away! No! All my life I've avoided Europe and its multitudes of terribleness.," But it turns out, much to my surprise, there is actually one place in Europe that is worth seeing: these tiny islands off the coast of Scotland, where God's chosen elixirs are distilled, barreled, and prepared for consumption.", This is worth the trip.," ""Dear Ron, ""you have now reached the cliffsides ""overlooking the islands."," ""As you sit here and gaze upon the waters, ""please read out loud the poem ""by the great Scotsman Robert Burns."," Love, Leslie.",""" ""Oh, were my love yon lilac fair, ""with purple blossoms to the spring, ""and I, a bird to shelter there, ""when wearied on my little wing, ""how I would mourn when it was torn ""by autumn wild and winter rude, ""but I would sing on wanton wing, when youthful may its bloom renewed.",""" I don't know what she thought I'd get out of that.", - Nice to be home., - It is.," But I mean, I love Pawnee, I will always love Pawnee, but London is amazing."," And Silkeborg sounds amazing, and Mongolia sounds amazing.", Their mayor is a professional Wolverine Wrangler.," Fine, Mongolia sounds terrifying, but the world is a very big place, and I've seen very little of it."," Maybe we should travel more, expand our horizons."," You know, I've had the same kinds of thoughts."," We should keep that in mind, see where it leads us.", Yeah.," Oh, there's one more thing I want to try.", Mm., I got you something in London: a traditional barrister's wig., - Oh., - Wear it for me., - Yeah? - Mm-hmm., All right.," What's up? No, not sexy.", Failed experiment., Take it off.," - Okay, just--okay.", - Just take it off., No.,   ,"
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 03,"Okay, here's the text I added a few more jokes, slamming Eagleton at the end.",Mmm.,That's the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.,I'm so glad you're on my team.,Are you sure you wanna attack 'em at this press conference?,It's a friendly wager on a high school basketball game.,"I'm losing the recall election, Ben.",Slamming Eagleton is the easiest way to score some points.,Look.,Am I proud of it?,Yes.,Because Eagleton sucks.,But is it the classiest move?,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks.",Would I do it again?,"Yes, because Eagleton sucks.","This year, we get to host the PawneeEagleton tipoff classic.",That awful human being is Ingrid de Forest.,She's a city councilor from Eagleton.,She thinks she's so great because she won the Miss Indiana Beauty Pageant.,Last year.,While she was in office.,And pregnant.,"As always, we would like to make a friendly wager with Eagleton.","If you beat us this year, we will give you a basket of apples from our Pawnee orchard.","Ew, pesticide.",Yuck.,"Oh, no, these are pesticidefree.","I ate one of these for breakfast this morning, and I found a worm in it.","So, I bet somebody feels pretty stupid right now.","Well, Leslie, I think we had similar ideas.","If you win, Eagleton will give you this basket of oranges.","Of course, it's silly to compare apples and oranges, but what the heck.","These are made of Swarovski crystal, and they're worth $700,000.","Leslie, you're down 15 points in the latest poll for the recall election.",What can you do to make up the deficit?,I'll tell you what I'd do if I was an Eagletonian.,I'd pop a Xanax and ask my butler to help me out.,"I mean, I'm not saying that Eagletonians are out of touch.","But when you tell 'em it's time to change their oil, they ask, ""Extra virgin or white truffle?",""" Thanks, guys.",I'll see ya at the game.,"Unless, of course, you're an Eagletonian, and then you'll be too busy polishing your monocle at the caviar store.",Knope out.,Yeah.,Who or what is Penny Saver?,It's a free circular with a bunch of coupons in it.,"This was sent to Ron Swanson at Diane's address, where I've lived for less than a month.",How is that possible?,This is an extreme invasion of privacy.,The right to privacy is very important to me.,My family has had a single P.,O.,box for several generations.,"We only ever subscribe to two magazines, Reader's Digest and Ebony.","Ebony was due to a clerical error, but it ended up being an interesting year of reading.","I don't know how this was delivered to me, but it cannot happen again.",How can I stop it?,Mm.,Donna is great with this sort of thing.,"She got me off the WilliamsSonoma mailing list, but then I just signed back up again.",Hooked on their oven mitts.,I need my mitts on those mitts.,Let me know the second Donna returns.,"According to her Twitter feed, she got coffee five minutes ago.","Wait, now she's Ustreaming her walk back.","She should be here in three, two, one.","Hey, hey.","Hashtag quest for coffee, blowin' up my timeline.",You get my snapchat about it?,No.,What?,There it is.,"Hey, you wanted to see me?",I did.,Think fast.,"Oh, my God.","Hey, Dr.","Buttons I mean, my old calculator.",It doesn't have a name.,Why did you throw this at me?,"I just got off the phone with our old boss from Indianapolis, and apparently there may be some sort of a budget problem in Eagleton.",He asked if maybe you and I wouldn't have a look.,You in?,"Butch Countsidy and the Sumdance Kid, together again.",Hmm.,Auditing bros!,"Yeah, and auditing sistah.",Let's do this.,"Oh, you're coming?","If there's a problem with Eagleton, I wanna be there.",That's like a dream come true.,"Besides, I have a new routine I'm working on.","Kind of like a Jeff Foxworthytype thing, but about Eagleton.","If you make your omelet out of Faberge eggs,  you just might  Be an Eagletonian.",Yippee!,Road trip!,Who's excited to go to Bloomington?,Is that where you're gonna sit?,I'm driving.,Where else would I sit?,Trunk.,"I helped April get into vet school in Bloomington and today's her orientation, so we're taking a little road trip.","While I'm there, I'm also gonna pick up an organic baby blanket.","I would get one in Pawnee, but fun fact our only baby store is attached to a chemical refinery.",I made a special road trip mix CD for us.,I hope you like Tori Amos.,"Oh, cool.","It really is a pleasure to see you in this context, Ingrid.",Say cheese.,Damn it.,You look beautiful.,Can you give us a little more information surrounding the deficits that you're running this year?,"Ooh, gosh.",We don't really like to talk about money.,We find a little gauche.,This is a budget meeting.,"Well, most of our files are in these boxes if you really wanna take a look at how much that we've spent.",Why don't we just dig in and see what we're up against?,Yes.,And thank you.,We really appreciate your help.,Are you tipping me?,Is that 100Euros?,People ought to have the right to be left alone.,I wanna get completely off the grid.,That's crazy talk.,I live for the grid.,"It's where I meet And if you're off the grid, how are you gonna post photos of the dope food at restaurants you're at and all the cool places you're stuntin' in?",Food is for eating.,Places are for being.,End of discussion.,"Don't leave the grid, Ron.",The grid is the best.,"If anything, you need to get more on the grid.","Grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid, grid If you help me get off the grid, I will let both of you go home early.","No grid, no grid, no grid, no grid.","All right, so you have everything you need for orientation?","Yeah, an empty Sprite can, an old man's fingernail in my pocket, and a picture of Patrick Ewing on a roller coaster.",I'm all set.,Great.,Hi.,"My friend here is enrolling in the vet school next month, and she would like to be shown around.","Totally, happy to.",I'm Laura.,I'm April Ludgate Kevorkian.,"So you go with Laura, who seems really nice and does not deserve to be tortured.",And I will come meet up with you after I finish at the baby store.,Sure you wanna leave me here with her?,What if I'm a murderer?,"Oh, that's funny.",This is worse than I could've imagined.,Their debttoequity ratio is ridonkulous.,What a hilarious word.,It reminds me of a ridiculous donkey.,He's the best.,What does this mean for them?,"They were in financial trouble a few years ago, like Pawnee was, but their government just kept borrowing money.",Eagleton is on the brink of an epic financial disaster.,Ahh.,Now that is the sexiest thing you've ever said to me.,"Really, that?",This is gonna hand me the recall election.,I saved Pawnee from bankruptcy.,Now I get to remind people of that fact as we watch our worst enemy collapse into bankruptcy.,"Plus, guess what I get to do after the game now.",You pretend you're Ingrid.,Let's pretend this box is the basket of apples I bet them on the game.,I see where you're going with this.,"No, you don't.","Yeah, you're gonna ask me  if I like apples  Do you like apples?","We just watched this movie two nights ago, so  Do you like apples?",I don't wanna do this.,How about them apples?,"Paul, if you ever see another one of these with my name on it, I want you to drive into the woods and bury it.","I don't decide who gets mail, sir.",I just deliver it.,Passing the buck the last refuge of the cowardly and blackhearted.,That seems harsh.,Get out.,We got rid of your cell phone.,This is your last credit card.,Are you sure you want me to cut up this card?,It gets you into the parking garage.,"I'll be taking the bus now, and I'll be paying in cash.",What other traces of me exist in the world?,"Think, people.","Isn't there a photo of you up at JJ's Diner, from that time when you aah!","Come on, Tom!",This place is unbelievable.,"It has everything I need: Video monitors, leadfree pacifiers.",These are the first bibs I've ever seen without Dale Earnhardt Jr.,'s face on them.,Really?,April?,"Excuse me, sorry.","April, why aren't you at orientation?","Um, I was at orientation, but it was lame, so I left.","And then I kept walking, and now here I am.","We are going back there right now, young lady.",Mmmm.,Come on.,"God, get off me, stranger.",I'm so sorry we're late.,We came from our bankruptcy brunch.,"And Michael Buble played, but he ran a little long.",I love Michael Buble.,Was a bankruptcy brunch the best idea?,"Sure, let's not have brunch like animals.","Well, um, some of these expenditures are questionable.","Uh, you filled the public pools with bottled water?",Total body hydration.,What is this here?,This massive expenditure from public works?,"Ah, yes.","Well, yes.",We purchased HBO for the whole town.,I'm sorry.,You spent government money on a TV subscription?,It's not TV.,Al right.,"Uh, Leslie's put together a presentation for a financial recovery.",Great.,You may find it very informative.,Let's get started with our first slide.,"""Well, well, well"" Tsk, tsk, tsk.","JJ, a few months ago, I came in here and began eating eggs.","They were delicious, so I ordered more.","Before long, I believe I had eaten Couldn't cook 'em fast enough.",The last ten were still in the shell.,"It was a JJ's Diner record, and you took his picture.","Now, we need that picture, for privacy reasons.","Okay, but I don't know how anybody would know it's you.",We followed your instructions.,That's too much information.,Let's go.,Where are we going now?,I've eaten a lot of food in a lot of restaurants.,Why is everyone else so bad at eating?,I only agreed to come back here because of our deal.,Do you promise to play along?,Yes.,Do you?,Yes.,"Hi, you're back.",Hello again.,"As you remember, I'm April, and this is Ann, my 65yearold grandmother.","Yes, that's who I am.","Anyway, we'd love to hear about Bloomington.",It seems like a real hip kind of college town.,"Meemaw, God, no one uses the word hip anymore.",Sometimes I wish you went down on the Titanic with all your sorority sisters.,I would be happy to show you guys around the campus.,Is there anything in particular that you wanna see?,How are your local graveyards?,I have some planning to do.,"""You blew it.","""Super hard.","""Complete buffoonery.",It's hilarious.,""" And ""You deserve it.",""" Hey, you think you might wanna take it easy on them a little bit?","Oh, like they took it easy on us when they stole all our money and seceded from our town?",That was 200 years ago.,Cool it.,Fine.,I'll skip ahead.,Do you have a plan that will help us or not?,We have borrowed absolutely everything we can from the state.,"And really, Pawnee is our only hope.",We do have a plan.,"We are willing to provide a bridge loan for $50,000.",compounded monthly.,And you need to release a statement that says that Pawnee rules and Eagleton drools.,"Well, now you're just being nasty.","I understand that our towns have a complicated history, but we have a saying in Eagleton ""You don't kick a dressage horse after a failed pas de deux.",""" Whatever, blondie.","Your butler made your bed, now you gotta lie in it.","And if you walk out that door, none of us here, and I repeat, none of us will ever help you again.","Oh, my God.",They have Michael Buble on retainer.,"Okay, all public photos of me recovered.",Nameplate removed from my office door.,Pediatrician files confiscated and destroyed.,Anything I'm missing?,"Great news, Ron.",JeanRalphio loves your shirt.,What the hell are you talking about?,"Oh, I've been taking pictures of you all day for my new Facebook album: ""RonSwan: Gettin' off the grid.",""" Tom, do you maybe see a problem with what you've done?",I do now.,"Yes, sorry.",Erase.,Erase.,Erase.,Erase all pictures of Ron!,Erase all pictures of Ron!,Erase all pictures of Ron!,What the hell is happening?,I think you accidentally opened up Vine.,"You just vined your first selfie, Ron.",And I'm vining you vine your selfie.,The world is a nightmare.,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.",Erase all pictures of Ron!,Erase all pictures of Ron!,The Bline is a cool outdoor trail that cuts right through downtown.,"She said the Bline is cool, Meemaw.",Cool means good.,"Thank you, Laura, for showing us around.",Sure.,"See you in a couple weeks, April.",See?,This place is great.,Aren't you glad we came back and talked to her?,No.,It was pointless.,I'm not going to school here.,"April, don't flake out on this.",You're gonna love it here.,Bloomington is great.,It's got culture and music and tons of youngsters.,Youngsters?,Am I 65 years old?,"Yeah, I'm not going here.",I don't want to.,Let's leave.,Think fast.,Oh!,Why do people keep assuming I'm ready to catch things?,"""Eagleton: No money, mo' problems.",""" Fantastic, right?",I made enough of them for everybody to wear at the game.,I do like a good internal rhyme.,"Ben, you ready for dinner?",We can go over the poll numbers.,"Ohyou know, I've got a few phone calls to make.",Can you give me an hour?,I can meet you there.,"Oh, my God.",What is she doing here?,"I'm sorry, Leslie, but you didn't really help them very much, so we volunteered to give them a little financial advice.",You didn't actually help us at all.,Just one second.,Yeah.,"I'm just gonna help them out, okay?",Mm.,Just for an hour.,He's just being a good neighbor.,"We're in a lot of trouble, Leslie.","I don't need any lip from you, okay?",You're in trouble because of your own stupidity.,I have a PhD from the Sorbonne.,For what?,Wearing Chanel suits?,"There was a fashion component, yes.",I'm not mad that you're doing this.,"Yes, I am mad that you're doing this.","But even worse, I'm mad that you just  lied to me about it.","Okay, I'm sorry.","We all swore that we weren't gonna ever help her again, ever.",I never said that.,You did.,I speak for all of us in all matters.,That is what you tacitly agreed to  when you married me.,What?,"Yeah, let's go.",You've changed your mind.,You're not gonna help her anymore.,"Leslie, I just wanna borrow your husband for the evening.",Can we please talk about what happened back there?,"What, Ann?",I just stole your phone and texted every guy in it that the baby was theirs.,It's not that big of a deal.,"Listen, I know you don't believe this, but I care about your future.",And I'm just a little disappointed that you're just not following through with this.,"Yeah, it's not about following through, okay?",I was on the fence about whether I wanted to do it.,"And as soon as I got there, I just had a gut feeling that it wasn't right for me, that's all.","So, just like that, boomhuge life decision made?",That's how I make all my life decisions.,"My gut is always right, okay?","It was right about marrying Andy, and it was right when it told me that you would be the worst person I would ever meet in my life.","And I've met Guy Fieri, Ann.",So gross!,How do you get your gut to talk to you?,You don't get your gut to talk to you.,You just listen when it says something.,"Well, right now my gut is saying that we are going to listen to Mariah Carey the whole way home.",Good.,Whoa.,"Wow, I'm really surprised you're sitting on this side of the bleachers and not on the Eagleton side with your new girlfriend Ingrid.","Leslie, I'm just trying to help them.",Why?,They wouldn't help us if the tables were turned.,"I mean, they're 50 points ahead, and they're still dunking.","I mean, look at this guy.",There's no way he is in high school.,"And I'm better at French horn too, Eric.","People are gonna lose their jobs, Leslie.",And the recovery will take years.,"Deep down, I think you feel bad for them.","Okay, I do a little, yes.",And I'm sorry that I blew up at you yesterday.,"With all the recall stuff happening, I just really need to feel like you're on my team, and seeing you with them made me feel like you weren't.", I'm always gonna be on your team., You never have to worry about that.," Defense! Oh! Eagleton player number seven, injured on the play.", Official time-out.," Oh, God.", I'm gonna say something.," And if I throw up on you after I say it, just know that you've been warned.", I know how we can help Eagleton., I don't see what the problem is., I will give you a certain amount of gold in exchange for a recreational vehicle., I still need an address for insurance purposes., This will be my new home., The address is wherever it is parked.," Where have you been? I had a flat tire, and I've been trying to get in touch with you for hours."," Sorry, darling.", I've been busy destroying most of my personal effects and threatening a postal worker.," Ron, I know you value your privacy, but you are a husband and a father now.", You can't just roam the streets in an RV and be impossible to find., I'm on a mission to get off the grid.," Well, you don't have to be entirely on the grid, but have to be on our grid.", I suppose you wouldn't consider moving., I've heard the school system in the tunnels beneath Yucca Mountain is adequate.," I love you, but your solution to every problem is to live inside a mountain.", I love you too.," Okay, one more time."," Are you absolutely sure you wanna go through with this? A lot of people are gonna get angry, and you might lose the recall election."," Or, if I pull it off, I just might win."," Plus, a very smart member of my team pointed out it's the right thing to do.", Good morning.," After an all-night strategy session, the towns of Pawnee and Eagleton have come up with a potential solution to Eagleton's budget crisis.", The town of Eagleton will be dissolved and re-absorbed into Pawnee.," Pawnee will provide some government services, as well as taking on some of Eagleton's debts.", I understand.," Look, I hate Eagletonians as much as you do.", I hate their stupid beautiful faces and their stupid shiny hair., We looked at every alternative., This is the only scenario that prevents Eagleton's financial crisis from spiraling throughout the entire region., Eagleton is terrible! Why should I bail them out with the hard-earned money from my unemployment check? - Yeah! - Because they are our neighbor and they've sprained their ankle.," And when your neighbor sprains his ankle, you help him off the court."," I understand you have concerns and questions, and we are here to listen to them.", I got something to say.," One at a time, please.", I hate the one-at-a-time system! Why should we bail them out? No one bailed me out when I got arrested for arson., You can't just merge two towns., It's against the rules of nature., What's next-- merging a man with his dog? I live in Eagleton.," And frankly, I don't like the idea of living in Pawnee."," They're a little-- oh, what's the word? Have-no-money."," Bertram, that's enough."," First of all, Eagleton has no money."," Second of all, they are gracious enough to throw us a lifeline, and we should be eternally grateful for their generosity."," They're a town of angels-- greasy, denim-clad angels, but angels nonetheless."," Yeah, we'll take it."," I mean, did you steal this from a museum? Maybe find it frozen in ice? It looks like the original phone from the movie Wall Street."," I think it's just the original phone, period."," Ew, gross, it has ""buttons.",""" Okay, girls, this is a magic phone, okay? Only you and I have got the numbers."," So if you ever need Ron for any reason, you just call and he'll be there in a flash."," Yes, I will.", I'll keep it right here.," It snaps right in, snug and secure."," A cell phone belt clip? No, Ron."," Oh, my God! Yeah, I can't be seen with you.", Travelin' Ann Perkins! How was Bloomington? It was amazing.," They had all the baby supplies we need, and they had all this other cool stuff."," They had a bike-sharing program and a vegan Afghan restaurant and-- Oh, my God.", I'm having one., - I'm having one right now., - A contraction? No.," Dude, I'm, like, three months pregnant.", I-I know., I'm just so excited., The thing I'm having is a gut feeling.," What would you think about raising our child somewhere other than Pawnee? Thank you, Leslie, from all of us in Eagleton.", Our citizens owe you a debt of gratitude.," Well, I think at the end of the day, everybody realizes it's something we have to do."," On the bright side, we did win the basketball game.", I think you owe us some apples., - You better pay up.," - Oh, you don't want them.", All of Pawnee's apples have been recalled-- - g., Coli., - You mean e., Coli? I wish., Way easier to treat., Welcome to Pawnee!   ,"
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 04,This is a historic day.,"At 12:01 this morning, the city of Eagleton ceased to exist and was reabsorbed back into Pawnee.","Things are exactly the way they were back in 1817, except, you know, women and minorities can vote, we have indoor toilets, and we no longer burn widows for learning arithmetic.","Councilwoman Knope is your merger czar, and in the binders that she's provided, you will find directions to your department in Pawnee that most closely matches your department in Eagleton.","There are two Eagleton departments Pawnee does not have: the Department of Infinity Pool Design and the Department of Dressage, which I am told is a fancy horseriding thing.","It is horsedancing, madam.","Okay, take it easy, Alonzo.","All you horse dancing people, sit in your saddles if you will.","The rest of you, welcome to your new departments.",Attention: Eagleton is now under martial law.,No.,"Okay, Pawnee Parks Department.","Soon, you will be paired up with a person who was roughly your equivalent in Eagleton.","Donna, you'll be with Craig.","April, you'll be with someone named Tynnyfer.","And Ron, your guy is also named Ron.",Guess there's no Tom Haverford equivalent.,"Not surprised, I'm one of a kind, just like the custom Nikes I designed that say ""Tommy's Tootsies"" across the toes.","You do have a counterpart, actually.","His name is Eric, and I've heard he's amazing.","Anyway, I also have a little surprise.",I would like to introduce our new filing temp.,"Hey, everybody.",No!,"No, why?",This can't be happening.,"Why, Leslie?",We brought Jerry out of retirement because we have a mountain of filing to get through.,"Welcome back, Jerry Gergic.","Thank you, Leslie.","And as long as we're starting out fresh, Leslie, I was wondering if people would call me by my real name.",Larry?,"No, it's not Larry.",It's Jerry.,"No, it's Gary.","Your name is Larry, Larry Gengurch.",His name is Larry Gengurch.,"Come on, April, it's already hard enough for my family when you call me ""Gary.","""  Jerry.","Ha, ha, classic Larry.",Larry.,"Larry, Larry, Larry.","Aw, jeez.","Look, I'm trying to save as many jobs as possible, but we're gonna have to lose some people.",I'm not sure who we should keep.,"April, Tom and Donna are three of the best human beings that have ever lived.",Ron is basically a better version of George Washington.,Butthe Eagletonians are probably good too.,"Today, we are not just merging two towns.",We're throwing a birthday party for a new city.,"Happy birthday, New Pawnee.",Party's over.,"You guys lost millions of taxpayer dollars, and we have to clean up the obscene mess you've made.",You're not as nice as the other guy.,I don't care.,"When we were state auditors, we had an amazing system.","Yeah, Chris pumped everyone up and made them feel positive and happy.",And I swooped in and slashed their budgets to ribbons.,Like a majestic alleyoop.,You're all amazing!,You're all fired.,Teamwork.,"Hi, you've reached the voicemail of Larry Gengurch.",Please leave your message after the tone.,"Well, when Leslie called to see if I could help, Gayle and I were just getting on a cruise ship to the Bahamas.","I said, ""Gayle, put that bikini away, because Pawnee needs me.",""" Oh ho!",Somebody forgot a banana in hereooh!,"Hi, I'm Donna.","Oh, that is the perfect name for you.",I love it.,Never change it!,Wasn't gonna.,"You're Craig, right?","Ugh, yes, but I hate that name.",It's so boring.,Sounds like someone's cousin.,Craig!,Craig!,"I want to be a Spanish man named Terrence, but that didn't happen.",Okay.,So here's my list of duties.,I'm basically the office manager.,How about you?,"Oh, I did everything.",Everything!,"I carried the Eagleton department on my shoulders for years, and I loved every second of it.",You don't even know!,"I'm sorry, was your name Jennifer?","No, it's Tynnyffer with two y's.","I used to be Jennifer, but then I decided to rebrand myself.","Oh, wait, hang on.",It's Xanax o'clock.,"Um, well, nice to meet you.","My name's April, and I just wanted to say that your dress is so cute it's bonks.","I saw my spinning instructor wearing it, and I was like, ""Shut up.",Where do I get that?,""" Oh, my God.",Who's your spinning instructor?,Gregory or Wynona?,I go to Yonis.,Who are Gregory and Wynona?,I've never heard of them before.,Are they better?,Wynona rocks my world.,"Seriously, you need to get me in there.","Like, that's a must, must, must.",She's the worst person I've ever met.,I want to travel the world with her.,Ron.,Ron.,Last name?,Dunne.,"Is that your name, or are you telling me you're finished talking?",Both.,Dunne and done.,I like Ron.,Hi.,"Well, well, well.",You must be Eric.,I'm Ragiv from I.,T.,This is E.,R.,I.,C.,E.,R.,I.,C.,is a computer program?,Stands for Eagleton Reservation Information Center.,It does all the scheduling in Eagleton.,I'm here to install it.,But scheduling's the main part of my job.,You still have a human being in charge of booking tennis courts?,"What is this, 1990?",I guess that explains the shoulder pads.,How did he notice these?,"Hey, this is a surprise.","Yeah, I just wanted to chat for a sec.","You know, just so you could hear some things from me.",Verbal things from my mouth.,Did that sound weird?,Is everything okay?,"Yeah, everything's fine.","First of all, this is Evelyn.","Oh, hello.",She is my Health Department counterpart from Eagleton.,There really wasn't a ton of work for me there.,Eagletonians are very healthy.,"Oh, well, this might be a very interesting challenge for you, because Pawnee has the very first documented case of megadiabetes.",And the only know occurrence of Lou Gehrig's other disease.,We've been written about in textbooks.,"Thanks, Evelyn, I'll see you back in my office.",I just need to talk some more words into Leslie's face.,Nice to meet you.,Ahem.,Wow.,I feel sorry for her.,"I mean, nobody can fill your shoes, Ann.",With your tiny little doll feet.,"Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.","I, uh, I'm gonna step down, and I'm gonna turn my job over to Evelyn.",What?,No.,Did somebody put you up to this?,Was it Evelyn?,I knew she was a monster.,No.,"No, no, no.","Chris and I have been talking, and we are thinking very seriously about leaving Pawnee and moving somewhere else to start our family Oh, my God, look at that.",It's waffles!,Delicious waffles.,Wait.,Should we try?,"Yeah, let's try.",Huh?,Mmm.,"Wait, what were you saying?",Try.,Just enjoy.,Yeah.,There we go.,"So, if I'm hearing you correctly, you're telling me you're not thinking about leaving Pawnee.",I am thinking about leaving.,"Is this one of those classic Ann ""not"" jokes?","Like, ""I'm leaving Pawneenot!",""" I don't do that.",I was hoping that you had started.,It's not definite.,It's just neither of us are from Pawnee.,And I have a whole family in Michigan.,And Chris is missing life in a bigger city.,And I just wanted to talk to you about it so you could hear it from me.,Do you hear that galloping?,Hmm?,"Whaoh, my look at that!",Joe Biden on a horse shirtless.,That's amazing!,"Uh, I've got a ton of work to do.","I'm super busy, so you can let yourself Look, if Ann wants to leave Pawnee, I get it.","I mean, who wants to stay in the greatest town in the world with her best friend and be happy forever when she can abandon her soul sister like an old shoe and move to a garbage city full of jerks.",I get it.,No hard feelings.,You have to text me.,I will.,"Sorry for the delay, ladies, I was busy being ambushed by treachery.",So did you have a chance to compare notes on your respective duties?,Totally.,"Tynny and I have been, like, totally bonding.",We've just been like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!,"Like, talking, like, so much forever.",It was all so delicious.,"I know, right?","This is, like, the best day ever.","I know, I'm eating it all up.",Wow.,It's nice to see a friendship blossoming instead of wiling away like a dying turd flower.,Totes.,"Um, we also came up with these nicknames for each other.",Slut and Skank.,"How crazemazing is that, Lez?","Well, you know what I think is crazemazing?",Commitment.,I'm looking for someone who's in it for the long haul.,"We are basically creating a new version of Pawnee, and if Pawnee is gonna commit to one of you, you need to commit to Pawnee.","Tynnyfer, do you have kids?","Ew, no.",I've had so much rejuvenation that I don't think a baby could get out of there if it tried.,You know it.,I guess we can make a switch to Bermuda grass.,It's only 80 cents more per square foot?,What?,Gimme gimme gimme.,You want me to put Bermuda grass in a continental climate that's a six on Beaufort scale?,In a park with zero drainage?,"I want Kentucky bluegrass, I want a 10 percent discount, and I want you to apologize to my best friend Donna!","Yeah, hi.",Is there and I'm just guessing here some kind of medication that you maybe need a lot of and have taken none of or maybe too much of today?,"Oh, I have a medical condition all right.",It's called caring too much!,And it's incurable!,Also I have eczema.,"Okay, Eagleton Ron, tell me a little about yourself.","Well, I love the outdoors, love nature.",Amen.,I'm a big believer in environmental conservation.,Recycling and composting and the like.,I'm a yoga nut.,And I'm a nut nut.,"They make delicious milks, man.","And I'm a vegan, of course.",Slowly working toward full freeganvegan.,What in God's name is freeganvegan?,You only eat vegetables that have been thrown out in people's dumpsters.,"What is on your foot, sir?",My trusty sandals.,I believe a man's feet should remain uncaged.,Same goes for all chickens.,"Well, Eagleton Ron, we here in Pawnee value loyalty above all else.",So would you be opposed to signing an official loyalty pledge to our new town?,"As long as that new town were open to the ideals of communal living, everyone pitches in towards a common good.","In the immortal words of Cat Stevens, ""If you want to be free, be free.",""" I no longer like Ron.",E.,R.,I.,C.,is an amazing program.,"Fast, fun and easy to use.",But there's one thing no man or machine can beat Tom Haverford at talking mad trash till I get what I want.,This guy Eric is a disaster.,What do you mean?,Just a bad attitude.,"""Oh, I hate this place.",Get me out here.,""" That kind of thing.",And unreliable.,And racist.,I think he may have even been to jail.,"Although, you know, maybe those are just regular face tattoos.",Wow.,That's not good.,I should probably talk to him.,"Well, let me see if can turn him around.",I don't want to put this on your plate.,You have a lot to deal with.,"Thanks, Tom.",You're the best.,"Okay, let's take a look at this list of assets owned by the Eagleton government.",Sell 'em.,They're gone.,You had six fulltime baristas on the payroll.,The baristas are gone.,As are the masseurs.,And the fulltime barista who provided coffee for the masseurs.,It is excellent having the old band back together again.,You know what?,This calls for some celebratory lunges.,"One two All right, Donna.",There's gonna have to be some cutbacks.,"I mean, your job is secure, of course.",You're basically the glue of this department.,But I think Craig's gonna have to go.,"No, you should keep him.","He's crazy intense, but I've never met anyone who cares more about this job.","Uh, Donna, I'm right here.",No joke.,He might care more than you.,"Honestly, if I had to choose between him and me,  I'd choose him.","Wait, what are you saying?",Are you thinking about leaving?,"I wasn't planning on it, but I could.","You know, I got the condo in Seattle, the fiance in Denver.",Huh?,It won't last.,"Leslie, I would be happy to go back into retirement if you have to cut the staff.",What?,Even Larry wants out?,What the hell is happening here?,Does everybody think that running a town is just some game where people can come and go as they please?,"Okeydokey, Leslie.",You're mad at me.,Don't take it out on everybody else.,It's not fair.,I'll tell you what's not fair.,I'm gonna have to watch the Oscars with Ben alone this year.,"Last year, don't you remember Angelina Jolie and the leg dress moment?","He had, and I quote, ""no comment.",""" How can you not have an extreme reaction about a dress like that?",It just doesn't make any sense!,"Okay, we need to talk.","I'm sorry, Ann.",I can't understand you.,You've developed some accent from that new town you might move to!,It seems like no one around here understands the meaning of loyalty.,I am the merger czar.,I make the rules.,And I'm gonna teach people the meaning of loyalty in a language they will understand complicated legalese.,"Knope, what are these contracts?",It's just a little something that I drew up for all the employees of the new town.,"Basic boilerplate language, blah, blah, blah.","I'm so sorry, honey, but Tynny and I won't sign anything until we speak with our life coach.","When Eric saw this, he smashed a bunch of computers.",Why are you doing this?,What's the big deal?,I'm just trying to stop time with legallybinding friendship contracts.,What part of that do you not understand?,You have lost your mind.,"I think you need a spa day, Les.",Fine!,You only have to work here until I'm dead!,Is that better?,What in the name of all that is holy is that smell?,Yerba matte tea.,Sweetened with stevia.,It's an allnatural plant extract.,Shut your damn mouth.,No need to curse.,There most certainly is.,"Okay, all Eagleton people meet me in the conference room.","All Pawnee people, sit at your desks.",And take it personally.,"I kind of feel like we got off on the wrong foot, so I made unity cookies with the Pawnee town's original colors of blue and yellow.","However, I did not have yellow frosting, so I had to use mustard.",But do not worry.,"I put tons of sugar on them, so it will even it out.",Mmm!,Sugar mustard.,"That's awful kind of you, Leslie, but I'm afraid those are a little too sweet for me.",I unhooked from that big sugar train over 30 years ago.,"You are a man of principle and I respect that, cool Ron.","So, what's your story, new Ann?",You're kind of pretty.,"I mean, you're not ""Ann"" pretty, but you have potential.","Thank you, but II don't work in this department.","Shut your kind of pretty mouth and, uh, eat a mustard cookie.","Okay, so let's chitchat, huh?",Let's get to know each other and then become familiar best friends.,I don't have time for this.,I'm halfway through designing a bamboo gazebo as a tribute to the founders of Motown.,That's so Craig.,"Oh, Craig!","We have fun, don't we?","Do you guys remember when this all started and I came in here with the cookies, and then Craig said something so Craig and we all laughed, and we were like, ""Craig!",""" Do you think it would be weird if we held hands?",Probably.,"This way, please.","Excuse me, Ron, I am talking to my best friends.",Let me go!,"Best friends, attack Ron!","Ben, it has been an honor watching you work today.",It's been like watching Leonardo work.,Da Vinci or DiCaprio.,You're that good.,"Thanks, man.",I was in the zone today.,This really has been a lot of fun.,The old juice is back!,"Hey, should we keep this going?","Celebratory dinner, just like the old days?","Ben, that's a great idea.","Hey, you know what?",I know who I'm gonna use to calculate tax and tip.,Me?,Can I just say something?,I'm having so much fun right now.,"Oh, my God, me too.","Like, so much fun.","Can I just say something, though?",Yeah.,Okay.,You don't want this job.,"Seriously, this place is the pits.","It's like, if you worked here, you'd be like, ""Ugh!",""" And Leslie would be like, ""Blah, blah, blah.",""" And you'd be like, ""Uh"" Okay, can I say something?","Right now, I totally think that you're right, and I had been thinking about going someplace warm while my husband is in jail.","Oh, my God!",Can I just say something?,Yes!,Okay.,You should totally stay at my house in Miami.,What?,I'm serious.,Come by anytime.,Just let yourself in.," The gate kind of jams sometimes, but you can just jump it.", You are so amazing right now., You're like skinny Mother Theresa., It's Dwayne Wade's house., I got his address off the Internet., I really hope he's there when she walks in and he throws a basketball at her head.," Okay, enough is enough."," What is wrong with you, woman? I don't need to explain myself to you! I am the czar.", I can do as I please., Those who cross the czar feel the wrath of the czar! Ann is thinking about leaving Pawnee.," Moving, with Chris."," Well, that's nice."," Nice, Ron? Edible arrangements are nice."," This is volcanically hot betrayal! She is my best friend! She's thinking about leaving, just like that! And she wants to ""talk to me"" about it? It's like, I don't even know what to say."," That you love her and you understand that it's her life, and geography will never change your feelings.", Whatever., I don't even need her.," I've got Tynnyfer now, and Craig, and Eric, the racist drug dealer who I've yet to meet.", Those are my real friends.," You can't force friendship, Leslie.", It takes time., I once thought I had a friend., Then it turned out he was the single worst person I have ever met.," I agree with Ron, Leslie.", It's like Moz once said.," ""Hold on to your friends.",""" Morrissey.", The Smiths., You don't know Meat Is Murder? It's one of the best songs ever written about industrialized beef consumption.," Okay, Eagleton Ron.", I think it might be time for you to go.," This Ron has the position pretty much locked up, and, uh, I don't think we have any room for you in our department.", Fair enough., I should have seen it.," Taurus and Capricorns never mix, do they? Just remember, Ron.", Giving in to hate is like drinking saltwater., The thirst only grows worse.," Leslie, remove this man before I commit an act of violence against him."," Whatever you do, I won't fight back."," After I defeated him in an epic struggle, E.",R.,I.,C., is gone., He's been replaced by T.,O.,M.,#NAME?," Big plans tonight, Craig? No, I have a ton of work to do."," Plus, my DVR is 13 months pregnant with episodes of Scandal.", Scandal's my favorite show.," I love every character, except for Mellie.", Oh! Of course you like Scandal! Because you're amazing! I love you.," And no matter what happens with this job, I will always love you."," Excuse me! Who even are you? How's your salad? Well, it's called the ""Good Earth Salad,"" but really, it's just cheese, toffee, and gummy bear worms.", This town is really unhealthy.," You know, I forgot that this part of being accounting bros was actually pretty depressing."," I mean, after the intense, almost meth-like high of solving accounting puzzles, we were always just beat at the end of the day.", I actually think it's something else.," Back in the day, this was all we had."," We'd go into a town, we'd fix problems.", We'd go back to some rundown motel.," Yeah, you'd exercise."," I'd re-watch Twin Peaks, then hit the Twin Peaks message boards and read The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer to find Easter Eggs I'd missed."," But now, Ann and Leslie are our real partners.", Yeah., It's a good thing., But you were a fine surrogate before we found them.," Just so you know, we're thinking of moving.", Don't know where yet.," Maybe Michigan, to be with Ann's family.", Wow., That makes me kind of sad., But also incredibly happy for you and Ann., We have come a long way., Something healthy! A cherry tomato., Nope., A gumball.," Ooh! What I really want to say is, I'm sorry.", You're my best friend., This whole thing is just scary and confusing., I love you.," I want to talk about this, all of this, whatever it means.", Was that okay? I guess it's good.," Again, I barely know you or Ann, so I don't have much to go off of."," - Well - Hey, Leslie.", Hey.," Uh, you are excused, Fake Ann.", That was six hours well spent., I thank you., Looks like you've made all your decisions.," Well, almost.", What were you talking to Evelyn about? Nothing., It's not important., The only thing that's important is you., I'm ready to talk about this., I want to talk about this., Is now a good time? Yes., Now is a great time.,   ,"

committee to recall Leslie Knope is relentless.,Look what they're handing out at elementary schools.,I'm Leslie Knope.,Tell your parents to recall me.,"We all know that I cannot spend as much money on ads as my opponent, but I printed out 10,000 ""Don't"" stickers and 10,000 question mark stickers.","That way, if you see a sign and it says ""Recall Knope,"" all you need to do is add the question mark and the ""Don't,"" and suddenly, it reads, ""Recall Knope?",Don't.,""" Why don't you just put the ""Don't"" in front of ""Recall Knope""?","Yep, that's a much better idea.",Can I have these question mark stickers?,Why?,I want to put them on stop signs.,"April, no!",Hi.,"Um, I need to talk to somebody about reserving a park.","Oh, we have a new policy.",Parks can only be reserved for witch covens or slipandslide competitions.,Which one are you?,"Uh, slipandslide competition.",Seriously?,No.,Why would you even compete in something like that?,It doesn't matter.,"Um, I called earlier about the free vaccinations thing.",We're hoping to set up a mobile hospital in one of your parks.,"I'm sorry, is there something wrong with him?","Tom, this witch wants to reserve a park for her satanic ritual.",Can you help her?,Right.,Smashing.,"Uh, yes, I'm Thomas Haverford.",I sort of run the whole department.,"Um, what was the name, then?","Uh, Nadia Statsky.",I'm from Doctors Without Borders.,Brilliant.,"The old ""D""s without ""B""s.","Uh, we can definitely help.","Yeah, Tom's your guy.",He actually used to run the Parks Department in his home country of Russia.,This one is mental.,"She's joking, obviously.",How could I be from Russia?,Not with this spoton British accent.,We can definitely get you sorted.,Right this way.,Okay.,Whoa.,I am pretty sure you shouldn't have a weapon at work.,"Literally everything is a weapon, son.","That folder, in my hands, is far deadlier than this bow in yours.","Oh, that's probably true.","So, Leslie and I just finished putting together our will, and she wants you to be the witness.",You mind signing it?,That's your will?,"You need that many pages to say, ""Give my stuff to my wife""?",It's a complicated legal document.,It doesn't have to be.,I've had the same will since I was eight years old.,"""Upon my death, all of my belongings ""shall transfer to the man or animal who has killed me.",""" What are these weird symbols?",The man who kills me will know.,"Okay, you should really have a will that's more than one sentence long.",You have a wife and kids now.,I could introduce you to our lawyer.,"The three most useless jobs in the world are, in order, lawyer, congressman, and doctor.",Pass.,"Ron, that document is nothing.",It's not even notarized.,"You know, if you die and you don't have a real will, most of what you own will go to the government.",Where is this lawyer you speak of?,"I'm pleased to formally submit Bill 68J, which funds a new bike path in Ramsett Park.",Motion to table this bill.,Second.,I also submit Bill 68R.,Motion to table.,Second.,You guys want to delay all my bills?,Fine.,I'm just gonna keep my head down and continue to get work done.,"All right, well, uh, motion to end this session early so nothing can get done.",Second.,"Gahhh, you guys are the worst!","Sorry, Knope.",We're just looking for any possible way to get you recalled because we don't like you.,It's nothing personal.,It absolutely is personal.,"That is the definition of ""personal.",""" ""The definition of personal.",""" Excuse me, we have an issue.","A tweet has been tweeted from the Parks and Rec Twitter, and I'm afraid it is quite sexually graphic.",It's probably just some bored teenager who hacked the account.,"Whoever it is, it's quite serious.","I don't want you to get recalled Knope, but damn, these people know how to pick a neck massager.","And before you get on my case about those stickers, I already did 'em.","Donna, there is trouble abrewin'.",We think that you may have accidentally tweeted from the Parks and Rec account rather than your own personal account.,Uhoh.,What'd it say?,"""See you tonight.","""Hope you like tongue baths, you big, nasty fireman.",""" Then there's a picture of a pair of lips and then a picture of an eggplant.","I'm both confused, and if we're being totally honest, a little aroused.",Ew.,"Not to give you too much of a peek into my personal life, but this could have been way worse.","What's important is, we deleted the tweet, and nobody is gonna know it's you, but Donna, you know, be more careful in the future.",This almost blew up in my face.,"I'm here live, at a press conference, where Councilman Jeremy Jamm will discuss a government scandal we are calling ""Twitter Watergate"" until we can find a snappier name for it.",Tongue baths?,Eggplants?,Firemen?,Those men are heroes who deserve respect!,This is how Leslie Knope runs her Parks Department?,"We are going to hold hearing after hearing, until we are satisfied.",This will be blown way out of proportion!,You have my word on it!,Ugh.,"Ooh, this is bad.",I'm gonna get fired.,"No one is getting fired, okay?",Jamm is trying to use this to hurt me in the recall.,"He's trying to take me down, and he's willing to attack my friends in the process?",No.,No way.,Not on my watch.,Not on her watch.,He is not gonna sully your name.,No sullying allowed!,"Don't worry about it, Donna.",We're gonna nip this in the bud.,"Guard your buds, 'cause they're about to get nipped!",Okay.,Okay.,"So, why does Doctors Without Borders want to come to Pawnee?",Pawnee is like a petri dish of weird diseases.,Did you know you have a higher rate of the West Nile virus than the actual Western Nile?,"Sorry, West Nile, looks like Pawnee wins again.",What else have you beaten the Western Nile in?,Cricket.,"Uh just fill out these forms, and we will be all set like two biscuits inside a tin.","So, you've gone insane.",That's fun.,I just panicked.,"She's so out of my league, my brain just made me talk that way so I'd seem cooler.",What should I do?,Nothing!,This is amazing.,April.,Fine.,"If you want to have a chance with her, obviously, you have to stop.","It's either that, or you talk like that for the rest of your life.",You think she'd marry me?,"All right, just let me do the talking here, okay?","I mean, he's a lawyer, I'm an accountant.",We speak the same language.,"I mean, obviously, accountants are a little more bad boy, but, uh, there's a respect there.",When will this be over?,"Hey, Trevor.","I've been talking to Ron about estate planning, and he is here to do some ""Good Will Hunting.",""" Because he has to draw up a new will, so Yes, I understood, Mr.",Wyatt.,Thank you.,"As I've said before, I just don't like puns.","Oh, well, my accountant friends seem to enjoy

and/or gemstones it may or may not take the form of.","If you don't give me the information I need, there's nothing I can do.","Oh, come on, Trevor.","Where there's a ""Will,"" there's a way.","I'm gonna say this one last time, Wyatt.",Check the accountant crap at the door.,"Yes, sir, I will.",Unintentional.,"All right, let's begin.",These hearings have two goals.,"One, to find out exactly how this offensive tweet came to be sent.","And two, to turn this whole thing into a media circus.",Ms.,"Knope, do you have a statement?","Well, it's actually quite simple.","Uh, a Parks and Rec employee forgot to log out of the Parks and Rec Twitter account, they posted a personal, of the Parks and Rec private message by accident, and, uh, that person is very sorry, and it won't happen again.",Stop stonewalling and tell us what happened here!,I just told you what happened.,It was an unfortunate mistake.,"Okay, sadly, due to your ""intracksidence"" Not a word.",We may never find out what happened.,"When this sick, depraved tweet first came to light, you said, ""The account was probably hacked by some bored teenager.",""" Now you're saying it's an unfortunate mistake.",Why do you keep flipflopping?,"Well, because I learned new information.","When I was four, I thought that chocolate milk came from brown cows, and then I flipflopped when I found out that there was something called chocolate syrup.",I don't think I'm out of line when I say that this scandal makes Benghazi look like whitewater!,It's utterly meaningless.,I think we need to hear from the unnamed employee behind the tweet.,Perhaps he or she  Or them.,It could be a bunch of hot ladies.,"Yes, perhaps ""them"" can finally give us the answers we need.","What, what, what?",There she is.,"Nadia, I didn't know what you wanted, so I got you a cappuccino, a latte, four bags of coffee beans, and a mini espresso machine.",What happened to your accent?,"Oh, yeah.",It's gone.,Huh.,"You know, I had a cold recently.","I think that may have affected my voice, like, in certain British ways.","Well, that's all there is to that story, so no need for any more questions.",You have a cold?,Can I feel your glands?,Sure.,"Wow, you are wearing a lot of moisturizer on your throat.",Best way to prevent crow's neck.,Is this glitter?,"So, those are the forms.",You filled 'em out.,Great.,April's gonna file these.,"Hey, when is the thing you're doing in the park?",I'd love to come by and maybe help administer vaccines?,Oh.,"Are you a doctor, somehow?",No.,No followup to that?,"Okay, great.","Um, well, I'm not actually gonna be attending the event, so if you could just give me the permit, so that I can go home to Indianapolis and never come back here?","I am in love with Nadia Whateverherlastnameis, and I'm gonna keep her here, using the most powerful weapon I have bureaucratic incompetence.","Oh, no.",You filled out Form 3208.,You were supposed to fill out Form 3248.,"Oh, God.",This is to lease a hangar at the airport.,I know.,"It's so crazy, it almost sounds made up.","Bureaucracy, right?",What are you gonna do?,Huh.,Weird.,"Someone left out a blender, fresh fruits, and rum?","I guess we gotta, like, make Daiquiris now.","I like to have music on while I work, you know?",What is this place?,Ms.,"Meagle, let me first say that I am a big fan of your writing.",Thank you.,It's good stuff.,Really good stuff.,"Okay, does anyone else here see a double standard?","Councilman Dexhart is currently being sued by two different women for sexual harassment, one of whom was the judge in the first woman's trial.",She was talking dirty to me.,She was reading the emails that you sent to the first woman.,"Look, I obviously never meant to embarrass the parks department.","My personal account is set to ""private.",""" Yeah, I don't even know what she writes on there!","Well, you may not know what she's writing, but we do.","In a shocking twist to an already juicy story, we have obtained access to Ms.","Meagle's account, via a third party.",Same hairdresser.,"Damn it, Typhoon!",Why'd you do this?,"Maybe if you had bothered to come to my Great Gatsby Brunch, you'd know.",I don't even need an exact number.,Just ballpark it.,That's all I need to get started.,"Or, I'm sure the state government would love to use your money to hire more bureaucrats, maybe build a library.","Fine, a ballpark figure.",Thank you.,God.,Holy [bleep].,Is this a joke?,"Another word for ""jokes"" is ""lies.",""" I do not lie.","Therefore, I do not joke.",Mr.,"Swanson, an estate of this size means that your children would never have to work a day in their lives.",This is going to take some time.,"Trusts need to be drawn, tax shelters.",That's enough.,I do not need some drawnout legal expedition to tell me what I knew when I was eight.,Here's my original will.,"Do whatever lawyer nonsense you have to to make it official, and I will sign it.",Good day.,Wait.,What are all these symbols?,I was right not to be threatened by you.,"Okay, I would like to enter into the record a selection of Ms.",Meagle's tweets.,Uhoh.,"Uh, can I request a brief recess?","It's okay, Donna.",I'm not gonna let them fire you.,"Yeah, it's not me I'm

with washboard abs.","You really think I hate you, after all we've been through the last ten years?",I honestly don't know anymore.,"Okay, I think we've done a lot of good here today.","Leslie, I am sorry, but I could not postpone these pointless hearings that Jamm is having.",He is just determined.,"Well, thank you for trying.",I have a question for you.,Do you think I'm annoying?,No.,Are you lying?,No.,Are you trying to protect my feelings?,No.,Do you think I'm being annoying right now?,Yes.,So you do think I'm annoying.,"I think that you ask a lot of the people that you work with, and I think that people do what you ask because they love you.","But, I also think that driving people as hard as you do can ruffle some feathers.",I think a lot of

Wow., I had not considered that.," Yes, I think that maybe you are on to something.", Yeah.," Just know that it's perfectly healthy to be thinking about-- Oh, you're joking."," Yes, son, I am.", First joke ever., Don't care for it., Death does not scare me., What I am worried about is spoiling my children.," I don't want 'em to be the kind of people who never work, live off their trust funds, who buy their wooden furniture."," I will leave my children $50 apiece for the cab home from my funeral and a steak dinner, end of discussion.", Okay.," I mean, look, it doesn't matter how much money you leave your kids.", What matters is that you teach them the right values.," But, if something horrible happens, and you want your kids to be left alone with no safety net, just so they can learn some kind of weird lesson, then, by all means, leave your fortune to the wild boar who gores you to death.", I'd never lose to a boar.," I'm sorry if I can be little annoying at times, but one person's annoying is another person's inspiring and heroic, so, you know, who are we to judge? And I'm sorry for writing those things.", Some of those things., I can't promise that I won't be inspiring and heroic in the future., And I can't promise that I won't complain about it., Deal., I got you an apology present.," Oh! It is all of your favorite lipsticks and nail polishes, and I got the same ones too."," I printed out a schedule, so we can wear them at the same time."," Now, I would like you to open each one in front of me, and tell me how you feel about them individually.", Let me take a picture., Are you tweeting this?

They're right here! Well, we're not witches.", That's sexist and offensive.," But we're right here, and we are not gonna sit in this room and let you drag our names through the mud just to score some cheap political points.", How dare you demean the value of the political points I'm scoring? We have had enough.," I am going back to work so I can do some good for this town, and my friend Donna is coming with me.", Hmm.," I prefer ""El Diablo.",""" Uh, this is not over, Ms."," Knope!

He's sweet, he's cool, and you're, like, way out of his league, so there's literally no risk for you at all here.", Okay.," Well, I am going to Rwanda in, like, two weeks for my job, so, what the hell?

the Fourth.",""" All you're trying to do is disenfranchise the people from former Eagleton, people who will most likely vote for me because I saved a lot of their jobs.",I move that we table the discussion until after the election.,Second.,Thank you!,Ah!,I'm so sorry.,I just get excited when you like me.,"I put my career on the line by saving Eagleton, and he's trying to rob me of their votes?",Those are my votes.,I've earned them!,I want them!,Give me those votes!,I don't have them on me.,I can't believe Jamm tried to pull that crap.,I can.,He's a horrible monster.,But let's focus on the more important issue.,You want to squeeze in one more practice session?,"Oh, do I?","Tonight, I am throwing Ben his dream birthday party, a roller skating bash with an early '90s theme.",Ben lives for the early '90s.,"The music, the fashion.",It's his favorite era.,As for the roller skating I have a thing for women in skates.,Okay?,"Everyone has a thing, and that's mine.","As far as things go, it's pretty innocuous.","Could be one of those dudes that kisses mannequins or whatever, but I like a woman in skates.",A lot.,"Hey, Ann, Ann called.",She wants her ugly outfit back.,Why are you dressed as a pilgrim?,"Leslie said it was a ""Come As You Were in the '90s"" party.",I assumed it was the 1690s.,"Babe, if it was the 1690s, we'd all be mummies.",What do you think mummies are?,Skeletons?,"Oh, boy.",Hey.,"I just came straight from work, so I couldn't dress up.",No problem.,You look wiggidywiggidy wiggidywiggidywonderful.,Wait a minute.,Pants on backwards.,"Kris Kross, right?",Nice!,What happens when you have to pee?,I actually just went.,I had to pull my pants all the way to the ground like a toddler.,"Nadia, the super hot doctor, has been hanging out with me for the last week.",She's definitely out of my league.,"Actually, we're not even playing the same sport.",It's kind of like she's in NBA and I work at a muffler store next to the stadium.,I can't believe we met just before you have to go on your stupid vacation.,"I'm doing doctors without borders, man.",I'm going to Rwanda.,Exactly.,That's a stupid vacation.,"Okay, well, why don't you win me that hugeass bear as a goingaway present?",No problem.,I'm a skee ball master.,No way!,Why don't you go pro?,I don't know.,I didn't want to be a cliche.,Yet another professional Indian skee ball player?,Right.,Now that's what I call shooting.,Is this a hunting game?,"Yeah, it's fun.",You want to play?,"Indeed, I do.","If you'd like, I could offer you some pointers.","Hunting, Donna, is about silence, balance, and patience.",Get ready.,"You know you're supposed to hit the deer, right?",Ugh!,"Get it together, Swanson.","Well, the game is absurd.","This gun is lightweight, there's no sight, and we are far too close to these deer.",Would they not smell us?,I want my money back.,How do I get my quarters?,"Oh, my God!",You are such a sore loser.,I am not a sore loser.,"It's just that I prefer to win, and when I don't, I get furious.",Employee!,Whoa!,Watch this.,"Oh, that was brilliant.",Sorry.,You probably don't know what that means.,"You know how you Americans say ""cool"" when something's cool?","Over in London, we say, ""That's brilliant.",""" Speaking of London, you haven't told me anything about work.",You still love it?,"Yeah, it's awesome.",I'm kicking ass.,"I'm like Chuck Norris, only instead of crushing bad guys' skulls, I'm crushing documents.",That's great.,Yeah.,Now be the Chuck Norris of making out with me.,I'll karate punch your face with my tongue.,Prove it.,Hiyah.,Get this.,I just asked the DJ what REM albums he has.,"He's got Monster, but not Automatic For the People.",Wow!,I know.,"It's like, what is this?",A mid'90s party?,No.,It's an early '90s party.,"Okay, Larry.",Tell us how this looks.,Ben wants to do a synchronized couple skate to Losing My Religion.,Hit it!,Leslie!,Leslie!,Leslie!,"I'm sorry, but we have a problem.",His name is Jeremy Jamm.,"Well, as noted in Article nine, Paragraph two Whoa!",Whoa!,Whoa!,Whoa!,"Jamm, I thought this bill was tabled?","Yes, and I called a special session and untabled it.",What's up with the roller skates?,"I was about to attend a roller skating birthday party for my husband, but this is more important.","Yeah, I don't care.",I'm a blades guy.,Point of order!,The councilwoman wishes to speak on this issue.,Will the councilwoman yield her time so we can vote on this sucker?,"No, I will not yield.",Nor will I yield for the rest of the evening.,A filibuster?,Are you dookin' on my chest right now?,No!,Gross!,"And yes, it's a filibuster.",Okay?,I am not willing to let you deprive me She's filibustering on roller skates?,She's gonna be strapped into those things for hours.,"I know this is a dire situation, but I swear to God, this is like a crazy sex fantasy for me.",How goes it?,"Pretty good, except I suck at skee ball.","Well, that's too bad, 'cause if you don't win me that bear, you're dead to me.",Understood.,"Hey, man, how many tickets for that bear, again?","40,000.00","40,000?","Oh, brother.","All right, you're gonna be my lookout for a second.","Hey, is he allowed to do that?",No!,"Get off the ramp, dude!",Hey!,You're supposed to be my lookout.,I thought it'd be funnier to watch you get busted.,"Hey, you're a doctor.",You know snitches get stitches.,I remember the first time I voted.,"I was in my bedroom, and I was five.","I voted for Mildred, my stuffed pig, but my cat, pancakes, won.",She had more funding.,"Politics, right?",What are you gonna do?,How long have I been talking?,Three hours?,"No, eight minutes.",Okay.,Maybe you should yield the floor.,Milton doesn't have a lot of time left on earth.,"Hey, just kidding, bud.",Will someone open my crackers?,The session ends at 11:00 P.,M.,She has to talk the whole time.,"She can't lean on anything for support, and no one else can help her.",Three strikes and she is done.,This is literally the most exciting thing that I've ever seen.,"I mean, think about it.",Where else on earth would you rather spend your birthday with Leslie?,"Well, maybe the birthday party she's throwing for me right now.",Everyone in Pawnee should have the right to vote.,Whoa!,"As I dissect this important and profound statement, I'm just gonna take these off for a second.","Bam, strike one.",No sitting.,Is the gong really necessary?,"Yes, it is.",I love Chinese crap.,"Lucy Liu, Nintendo, Gangnam Style, sushi, et cetera, et cetera.","Also, more importantly, it's in the rules.",No sitting.,"Okay, fine.","Well, the strike is worth it if I can take these off.","Oh, man!","Oh, my God!",I had this exact bear when I was a kid!,Excuse me.,Uhhuh.,How much does this bear cost?,"Okay, well, let's just assume that I'm an adult who doesn't have two weeks to play arcade games.",What about 50 bucks?,Yeah.,Just don't tell my boss.,"What are you doing, Morris?","Nothing, Mr.",Bonderman.,Tuck in your shirt.,God!,Sorry.,Oh!,You feeling it?,Wow.,You suck at this.,"Donna, please back up two paces so I can physically destroy this machine.","Can you chill a little, man?",It's not real hunting.,It's just a game.,That you happen to suck at.,You know what?,That's a good point.,What?,That you suck at this?,That it's not real hunting.,Come with me.,I don't want you to go back to London.,"Just remember, every time you look up at the moon, I, too, will be looking at a moon.","Not the same moon, obviously.",That's impossible.,See you on stupid Skype.,I'm proud of Andy.,This is the first time he's really gone out on a limb.,"I knew if he found something that he actually liked doing, he'd be happy, so I'm What the hell?",Wha Hey!,Perkins!,What are you doing with my bear?,"I've been playing skee ball for, like, two hours trying to win that for Nadia.",I just bought it for 50 bucks.,"When I was a kid, I taught myself how to make out on this bear, pretended it was Cockroach from The Cosby Show.","Hey, what's going on here?",Why does blossom have my bear?,"I bought it for myself, but apparently, he was trying to win it for you, so I'm sorry.","I still got some tickets, though.","I could get you, uh, a ninja turtle balloon or Cliffhanger on VHS.","Oh, that's so sweet, but you're basically offering me garbage.",Let's just skate.,That bear was the only thing she was gonna have to remember me by in Rwanda.,"And if I know anything about Rwanda, and I don't, I bet it's full of rich guys who'll buy her whatever she wants.",Hunting.,No quarters required.,Hang on.,Do you have a license to hunt at night?,'Cause you need a license.,I thought you were serious.,Come on now.,You know I don't give a [bleep].,"As Ronald Reagan would say, ""Well, mommy, I believe voting rights are important.",""" Does anyone else think it's hot in here?",These overalls are really starchy.,"Yeah, maybe that's 'cause I turned up the heat to 90, and, uh, oh, the knob broke off in my hand.",Oops.,"Well, speaking of heat, we should discuss America's whitehot passion for voting rights and the men and women who help protect them, like the local city councilwoman who is starving and thinking about her husband's Reservoir Dog themed birthday cake and wanting to eat it really badly.","Oh, this is not a good sign.","Once she starts thinking about birthday cake, she's basically useless until she eats birthday cake.",Democracy is not unlike a cake.,"It's layered, delicious, chocolate, and I want some.","Okay, she's fading.","Ben, we need to find a way to smuggle some mineral oil drops onto her tongue.",Whoa!,Whoa!,Whoa!,Whoa!,Excuse me.,What the hell are you people doing here?,We represent the citizens of former Eagleton.,We're here to support Leslie Knope for preserving our voting rights.,Thank you!,You are all warriors of democracy.,"You know, it was the first mayor of Pawnee, in 1817, who said, ""All we have is the right to vote and the right to kill Indians without consequence.",""" And I believe that half of that statement is still true today.",All right!,Second wind!,"Andy, I know you're in there.","Andy, come on.","Oh, hey.",I was just just here in this dumpster 'cause I jumped in.,Get out!,We need to talk.,About what?,"Fresh air, real weapons, an honest kill.",There is no substitute for the real thing.,"You want to go back and play that video game, don't you?",Yes!,Damn it!,It is so inspiring to see Eagletonians putting aside their prejudices.,"With support like this, Leslie Knope may stand a fighting chance on recall day.",Permission to hug you.,Granted.,"I should mention, though, that we're not voting to keep Leslie.",What?,We want someone from Eagleton to represent our interests on the new city council.,"Sir, I formally revoke our hug.","Well, you can't.",It happened.,"We stand on the side of Rosa Parks, and Gandhi, and Team Aniston.",One small vote for Pawnee is one giant leap of voting for mankind.,Hey!,"Hey, you're not allowed to receive help from the crowd.",That's strike two.,"Hey, man, leave my gong alone.",The reverb is the best part.,"If I save your right to vote, you're gonna vote for someone from Eagleton?",Eagleton!,Eagleton!,"Hey, Knope!",Wrap it up!,I'm not gonna yield.,I justI need some time to think.,"And because I must keep talking, I'm gonna think out loud.","Okay, if Eagletonians vote for someone else, then it would be in my best interest to stop, right?",So they can't vote.,"Uh, dadoy.",Yield.,"Or I keep going, because the right to vote is fundamental in any democracy, and this is bigger than me or anyone.",I don't care if I lose.,No one prevents people in my town from voting.,Not on my watch.,The filibuster is on!,Yeah!,Okay.,I can't go back to London.,I'm totally in over my head on this project.,"Every day, someone comes up to me and says, ""I need your approval on this, Mr.",Dwyer.,""" ""I need your signature, Mr.", Dwyer.,""" ""That's not a toilet, Mr.", Dwyer.,""" But you said everything was going awesome.", You said you were like Chuck Norris.," I am, but I'm like Chuck Norris now-- some old guy with a beard who used to be good at karate but became a dumb has-been and is scared and confused about his big London job.", Okay., The parallels between he and I are very eerie., I'm gonna tell you a secret about everyone else's job., Okay., No one knows what they're doing., I don't know how to run an animal control department., Half the documents I get I put right into the shredder because they're so boring., But you seem like you do know what you're doing.," Yeah, I seem like it."," Deep down, everyone is just faking it until they figure it out."," And you will too, because you are awesome and everyone else sucks.", - 30 minutes to go.," - Oh, God, it's so hot.", Almost as hot as the flames that Eagleton would have gone down in if I had not saved them.," Mm, mm, mm.", - That's-- - How I know you would love an ice-cold frozen marg., All I want is the promise of democracy., Sure about that? - I want that marg., - I know you do., - I want that Margarita.," - Oh, it's gonna be so good.", So cold., It's so cold., - I want to drink it.," - Make that heat go away! Come on, get! Come on, girl.", Get! Give me that Margarita! No! I want votes.," Excuse me, worker, bring me a bucket of beers and four hot dogs."," Please, and thank you.", Why are you covered in blood? Don't worry., It's not human.," I hope you've made peace with your God, small electronic deer.", Kill it.," Ann, I need that bear.", I got to give Nadia something awesome so she'll remember me when she's in Africa.," Tom, bear or no bear, she clearly likes you."," Actually, how do you even get girls like her-- or me-- to go out with you? Scientists say the emotions of love and hate are very close to each other.", That's what I tell women.," The point is, she's leaving in two days."," You want her to remember you? Go spend time with her and do something memorable, dummy! Thanks, Ann."," I know conversations like this are hard for you 'cause you still have feelings for me, but you'll land on your feet, kid.", - Run or I punch you.," - No punchies! Okay, bye for real this time."," Wait, wait, wait.", I made you five bologna sandwiches in case you get hungry on the way to the airport.," Did you-- Yes, I used cookies instead of bread.", You think of everything., I love you., Love you too.," Are you kidding me? - Andy! - Ha! Ha! Found it! I got--I left my wallet in here earlier, I guess.", Whoo! All good now.," Ooh, look! Noodles! No, no, no, babe."," Babe, don't touch those.", I've read the entire charter., There's no other way to get her a bathroom break unless we bring the bathroom to her-- that's nothing.," I mean, she's not gonna make it."," Look at her, she's dancing around like she's a character in one of those Peanuts cartoons."," Okay, in these last few minutes, I would like to talk about the voting rights act of 1968 while clenching every muscle in my body."," Sound good? Hey, Knope, how you feeling over there? You go pee-pee? Pee-pee times? Make wee-wee? Ten more seconds."," Four, three, two, one! This session is adjourned.", All pending matters are tabled., Yes! - You were amazing.," - I love you, but move! I have to go to the whiz palace."," Oh, wait! Eagleton! Eagleton! Oh! My beautiful curls! She didn't have time to hug me, but she could do that? Hey, Ann, can I talk to you for a second? About Tom? Sure.", You guys look like you're having fun.," Yeah, no, I really like him."," I just wanted to say that I think you're really cool, and the fact that Tom dated you makes me think he's a really good guy.", That's so sweet.," Oh, okay."," Wha--what are you-- - What the hell? - Now! Sorry, Ann, this is on you.", You told us to make a memory., - There's your money back.," - Let go! Suck it! This is $8! - Man, that was so much fun.", - Yeah.," Together, we truly did steal a toy from your pregnant friend."," - Hey, can I ask you something? - Mm-hmm."," I know we just met, like, two weeks ago and whatever, but is there any chance maybe, when you get back, we can maybe-- Ugh.", Clingy.," Oh, no.", Sorry.," No, no, no, no.", I'm kidding., Of course I'll call you when I come back., - Really? - Yeah.," So long, suckers! Hey! Quick! Ooh! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Now that's what I call shooting.", - Come on! - That's a new record! Hey! Look at that! You finally made it in the top 10., Now you can enter your initials., My initials are private., Then just put in any three letters., Ass.," Oh, my God! That was epic! I was peeing so freakin' hard, it was like a jacuzzi jet or-- - Hi, Leslie.", - Hey! Ingrid! I wasn't talking about the velocity of my pee because you are a very smart and classy lady.," Ben, you remember Ingrid de Forest from the former Eagleton."," Yes, she was just telling me she's been nominated to run against you in the recall.", Wow., Buzz kill.," I know you must hate me right now, Leslie, and that's justified, but I need to thank you for what you just did in there.", Not the forceful urination., The filibuster.," Right, yeah."," It was incredibly courageous, and it was selfless."," And if I do win, I'm gonna have very big roller skates to fill."," Could I take you out for a celebratory plate of-- I think you call them waffles? Wow, that is the best offer you could ever make, but I had to miss my husband's birthday party for this, so I think I'll be spending the evening with him."," - A rain check, maybe.", - Please., I'm sorry your birthday party got all screwed up., Maybe I should put those roller skates back on.," Well, you must be exhausted.", We don't have to go to the party.," Oh, we're not going to the party.", We're going home.," Then why would you need to put on rollerskates? Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! We're just-- we're just--skates   ","
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 07,Business at RentaSwag could not be better.,"Yesterday Jaden Smith came in, and he was like, ""Look, I want to quit the music/acting business and work here with you.",""" And I was like, ""Jaden, be serious.",The world needs you.,You have a gift.,""" Ever since my client opened his store across the street, your sales have plummeted.",It's only a matter of time before you're out of business.,"But my client has had a moment of weakness, something he referred to as ""sympathy""?","He's made you a final offer $40,000 for RentaSwag and all of its contents.",I suggest you take it.,"Well, I've heard all the facts, and it's pretty obvious what I have to do Get a big old mug of hot chocolate, put on my thinking PJs, and get back to you.",The offer is valid for 48 hours.,We would also be interested in acquiring your thinking PJs.,Listen to me very carefully.,"No matter what happens, you will never acquire my thinking PJs or my YouTube blazer Nonnegotiable.","Season 6, Episode 7 ""Recall Vote"" Sorry.",Sorry.,"Larry, everyone else was able to make it to the committee meeting on time.",What's your excuse?,I was voting for you in the recall election.,Lots of people wearing Leslie Knope buttons.,No discussion about the recall election until the polls close at 8:00.,Let's focus on what we can control.,"In 24 hours, we are going to transform City Hall into the best haunted house Pawnee has ever seen.",There's been a mistake.,"This says that I'm in charge of the silly skeleton room, when really it should say ""the undead serial killer room.","""  Who do I talk to about changing this?",It's recall day.,"I've made my case, and the latest polls have it as a dead heat, so there's nothing left to do but wait.",I'm fine.,"I mean, I got stuff to do.",I'm planning a haunted house.,"Plus, um It's Kevin Pollacks birthday.",That's something to focus on today.,Who cares about the recall?,It's Kevin's day.,"I don't know what to do I could take the offer and break even, but I've come so far.","Ron, can you put some more tiny marshmallow in my hot chocky?",Thank you.,"If there was something I could do for you, I would.",Maybe you should try taking a walk Out of my office.,Ron!,You're in Bloosh!,What?,Ron's in Bloosh?,Ron is in Bloosh!,What is Bloosh?,Bloosh is a weekly lifestyle email written by Annabel Porter.,She used to be the face of the Eagleton phone book.,Then she moved to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming friends with a bunch of celebrities.,Then she moved back to become a lifestyle guru.,She's legit.,She spent four months living in Kate Bosworth's pool house.,"""A Ron Swansondesigned chair is the musthave item of the season,"" ""along with red quinoa, wind therapy, and buying an island.",""" Annabel says that buying an island is the only real way to know that your gojiberry farm is pesticidefree.",I've been trying to get RentaSwag in Bloosh for months.,"And now that you got in, I can get in too.","Congratulations, Ron!",We did it!,Someone's getting a new leather jacket.,I don't want a leather jacket.,It's for me.,This is a great day!,Ron's in Bloosh!,Ron's in Bloosh!,What?,Ron's in Bloosh!,Do it.,Ron's in Bloosh!,"April, you seem depressed, and I would know.",I spent most of last year being treated by Dr.,Richard Nygard for my own emotional problems.,"Yeah, I just miss Andy.","Halloween was, like, kind of our thing.","Every year, we would dress up like demons and egg Larry's house.",That was you?,"Larry, please.",We're having a private conversation.,"Well, I'd like to make Halloween fun for you, like Andy would have, starting right now With scary, scary monster claws!","Okay, people, the grand opening is in 20 hours.","Larry, you had the easiest job Two triangles and a tooth.",Nobody wants Gengurchfamilythemed Jackolanterns.,Gayle likes them.,Is any of this even good?,"Why didn't we call it ""City Halloween""?","Okay, we need to change every single banner.","Leslie's been holding it together pretty well, but today is when she needs us the most.",That's why we formed the Leslie Knope emotional support task force.,"Anything she could possibly need to get her through these final hours, we got it covered Back rubs, YouTube videos of turtles and birds becoming friends A poster announcing the new Lilith Fair concert.","It's fake, but it'll buy us an hour.",We even have a secret hand signal in case we think she needs help.,It's loosely based on the Klingon greeting salute.,I just learned that.,"And if I had known, I would not have agreed to it.","Uh, hey, Leslie, how about instead of slightly changing a lot of banners, we paint our toenails to look like pumpkins?",Fun!,"Ann, you're a genius!",Your brain is almost as perfect as your face.,"Hey, Ron, baby, what are the hot deets on Bloosh?",Start over and speak differently.,Sorry.,Did you call that P.,R.,guy?,What's the latest news?,"Apparently, Joan Callamezzo wants me to go on Pawnee Today to discuss my chairs with this Porter woman.",I said no.,"Ron, you said if there was something you could do to help me, you would.",Getting in Bloosh is my last chance to save my store.,You have to go and take me so I can meet her.,Please?,Fine.,"If it's that important to your company, I'll do it.",Yes!,"Now, I know highend, Internetonly lifestyle magazine really isn't your scene, so Donna and I wrote up some cocktail banter and some conversation snippets for you to

the results to pour in.,Thank you.,I'll see you all tomorrow.,We're not going anywhere.,We're staying with you.,"No, really, it's gonna be hours before they call it.","We're not leaving, woman.",Stop trying to get rid of us.,"Yeah, I made frappuccinos for a little caffeine boost, and Larry went to get pizzas for everyone.","Aw, that's very sweet, you guys.",Thank you.,"All right, let's hunker down.",It's gonna be a long night.,"Too close to call, a real nailbiter, anybody's game These are three phrases you won't hear tonight, as Leslie Knope has been voted out of office.",What was expected to be a close race What did he say?,Has actually been a not close race.,"Pawnee voters have decisively removed Leslie Knope  Honey, I'm so sorry.",From the City Council.,"I gota the pizza pizza time, it'sa pizza time!","Larry, everyone is miserable, and you are only making it worse.","Okay, Leslie's on her way in.",Is she okay?,"I left her, like, and her outgoing message is just her sobbing and burping and crazy laughing.","Yeah, you know what?",She's actually handling it pretty well.,"What's up, fartwads?",Are you eating a paunch burger?,"Well, you know what?","If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.","I mean, I've been boycotting them ever since Pinewood and her goons started this whole recall business, but who cares now, right?",What does it matter?,Nothing matters anymore.,Mmm.,"Oh, my God.",This is good.,This is really good.,Why did I ever fight this?,Have you thought about a concession speech?,"Oh, concession speech?","Yeah, I wrote one.","""Eat my shorts, Jabronies.","Knope, out.",""" I thought it best to revisit the concession speech at a later time.",But we should focus on the haunted house.,"And you know what I think it needs, actually, is a papiermch Li'l Sebastian!",What?,Oh!,I'm gonna go fall asleep on a bench.,I can honestly say today's guest is the only person in this town who's a bigger deal than I am.,Please welcome lifestyle guru Annabel Porter.,"Hello, hello.",It's me.,I'm here.,"Yes, you are.",Hi.,"Can I just say, as a journalist, I feel like we're best friends.",Tell the audience about yourself.,"Well, I'm just a simple former phonebook model who found her calling.","You know, I'm not perfect.",Oh.,The average woman worries about what she looks like in a bathing suit.,So does my nanny.,So I get it.,"Annabel, what trends are Pardon the pun, but Trending?","First of all, Mozambique cashmere is the new castiron stove.",Of course.,"I have found some amazing new conflictfree paella recipes, and, luckily, my favorite fishmonger now makes house calls.",Thank God.,Finally.,But my fave new item is a deliciously bold chair  Ooh.,By local artist Ron

you.,"Hey, guys, come on in.",Welcome to the den of horrors.,Where's all the scary stuff?,"Scary stuff is invisible, Leah Broken dreams, disappointment, achieving your greatest goal and having it all fall apart and knowing that you'll never climb any higher.",Can we have some candy?,"I'm gonna give you something sweeter than candy, Ryan The truth.",It's very possible that some of you have already peaked.,"It's all downhill from here, turkeys.","Okay, let's say goodbye to Ms.","Knope, kids.",It is Ms.,Knope.,"It's not city councilwoman Knope, because that chapter of my life is already over.","Just remember, kids, nothing gold can stay.",Okay.,"Oh, my goodness, we are back with America's greatest leader Annabel Porter and her new favorite artisan, local woodworker Ron Swanson.",Hello.,"I discovered Ron's chairs a few months ago, and what I absolutely love about a Swanson is you can really use it for anything.","Yes, mostly you use it for sitting.",Make it a rustic accent piece in your solarium.,"Even better, use it as a focal point in your yoga tent.",Put it by a table and eat a meal.,We don't do meals in my home.,"No, every two hours, we eat what I like to call a food tease, like an oat wedge or a seaweed lozenge.","Can I just say And I think this is really important, so I need everyone to shut up  I love your hair.",Oh.,Thank you.,It's genetic and unattainable.,I am scaring you!,I could see you.,"There's, like, a million mirrors in front of me.","And you're never gonna make me not miss Andy, okay?",What about this?,"I'm Bert Macklin, friendly lifeguard.",Bert Macklin is not a lifeguard.,He's an FBI agent.,Really?,That's even harder to believe.,"Just stop, okay?",Your lame attempts at trying to cheer me up are not working.,Now I'm sad that I miss Andy and sad that I can't make fun of you to Andy.,I understand.,I'm sorry.,"I've failed you, both as a scary monster and a friend.","Hey, I am really sorry.",I know you must feel awful.,I don't feel awful.,"You know, actually, I feel like I can finally relax.",Accepting that you've peaked is very freeing.,"Yeah, I know the feeling.","I was impeached when I was 18, and it was brutal.",But you just have to keep climbing back up that hill.,Or do you?,"Maybe instead of working super hard to rebuild your life, you just said, ""I peaked.",Wow.,What a great run.,""" ""And now I'm going to spend the rest of my life really chill.",""" Well, sure, I mean, part of that sounds very appealing.",Yeah.,"But, nno.","Uh, see, iit was important for me See, I took a job in City budget crisis management, and now I work for a candy charity.","Oh, God, did I peak when I was 18?",There it is.,Drink up.,Whoo!,Shots!,B13 shots.,Bird bath salts.,Wha?,Champagne decanters!,This is heaven.,I love your chair.,I need 12 for my stepdaughter's craft room.,"Well, I make two a year, so maybe in six years.",Can you put me on the wait list?,Me too Unless your chair was ever touched by someone who ate refined sugar.,"Then I can't buy any of your chairs, and I protest this entire event.","Okay, Ron, Annabels coming over.","When you talk me up, be sure to mention that you really admire how I take big risks with men's neck accessories.",There he is.,"Hello, hello.","Thank you for your kind words about my chairs, Miss Porter.","No, thank us.",You are about to make a ton of money.,I want to license your designs.,We are going to put Swanson chairs in every sixbedroom home in the Midwest.,"If my chairs were massproduced, they wouldn't be Swanson chairs.",Swanson chairs are handmade.,"Yes, and now they will be made by thousands of tiny Chinese hands.","Oh, Miss Porter, this is my very good friend Tom Haverford.",He's a big fan of your Whatever you call what you do.,Please speak to each other while I leave.,"Oh, no, I am not done with you, you wicked little soandso.",Terrific.,You know what?,"I had my time, you know?",I did my thing.,"I wanted to be a city councilor, and I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!","And the people were like, pffft!",At least we have each other.,I love you so much.,I love you too.,This is real.,I know.,You're my husband.,You're my wife.,You married me in front of people.,I did.,I was there.,"We may have peaked, but it doesn't matter.","We need to do something big, you know, something that really lets people know that we're gonna love each other forever.",Yeah!,What is it?,I got it.,"Hello, sir.",We are sober.,"We would like to get tattoos on our bodies, 'cause we love each other.",Tattoos?,This is a pawnshop.,"But, yeah, sure, I can do that.",Awww!,Yes!,It happened!,Look what he's doing.,He's breaking pens.,This is the idea of the century.,Right here.,Come here.,My store is called RentaSwag.,It's a clothing rental service for teens.,It's an interesting idea.,Are you guys doing well?,We're doing amazing.,Mm.,And it'd be perfect for Bloosh.,Why don't you take out whatever you wrote about my chairs and put something in about RentaSwag instead?,This month's trends are final.,I can't just throw a trend out.,But my Bloosh scouts have started trendtracking for the February zine blast.,"Good God, these words.",I'll have them stop by your store.,That'll be too late.,We'll be out of business by then.,I thought you said you were doing well.,"Ronnie, one last time, have you reconsidered mass production?",I can sell your chairs on my site.,"No, thank you, ma'am.",I'm not interested in letting someone else sell my work.,"Well, that's too bad.",This party is over.,It no longer is.,It was.,It was?,That was my last shot.,"Sorry, Tommy.",Let's just grab some of that lychee body oil and bounce.,Can you grab me some of those pomegranate face masks too?,Fo' sho'.,Can I ask you a question?,Are we the cutest couple you've ever seen?,Nope.,"Okay, you want the long needle or the short needle?",Doesn't matter.,Can't find a short needle.,Long needle it is.,I have a big idea.,"I want a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, tastefully done, and then she has a very classy tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm.",And that's very subtle.,"No, scratch that.",Scratch all that.,"Just write ""Ben"".",Do you have anything to numb the pain?,"Sure, take a scoop out of the pill bucket.","Okay, you said you wanted ""mouth queen""?","No, stop.",Stop it.,Stop everything that you're doing.,Stop it.,Ann's here!,Ann wants a tattoo!,Ann!,"No, no!",Ann!,No!,Shh!,Ann does not want a tattoo.,No one wants a tattoo.,"Ann, relax.","Be ""respitable"" for a second, okay?",What we are doing is not nuts.,We are merely getting tattoos so that everybody knows we love each other and that we haven't peaked.,It makes a lot of sense.,"Okay, we're leaving, all right?",So say goodbye to the nice man and thank me for saving you from being on Dateline.,"Okay, let's go.",Come on.,"Goodbye, world traveler.","Later, bro Heisen.", - Go., - Come on.," I don't want to be a failure again, Ron.", There's no shame in failure if you gave it an honest effort., Easy for you to say.," People are dying to give you money for your business, and you didn't even take it.", I didn't sell my chairs to that website because I value my name., The only thing that's important at the end of the day is what's on your gravestone Your name., My gravestone's gonna be a 60-inch touchscreen with a hologram of four mes singing End of the Road by Boyz II Men But point taken.," Ben, what is the first rule of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force? Don't let her get a tattoo.", - What the hell happened? - I couldn't help it., She's so cute when she's coming up with destructive ideas., Never send a husband to do a best friend's job.," Out, Wyatt.", Walk it off., - Walk it off., - Fine., - You did it., - Yep.," - See you later, Ann."," - No, Knope, sit down.", - You are avoiding your problems.," - What? No, I'm not.", - Can we talk about this tomorrow? - You were down in the polls., Your opponents were well funded and well organized., You must have known this would be a possibility.," Intellectually, I knew that I might be in trouble, but deep in my heart, I never really thought Ben and I tried to help you, but as usual, you're the best person for the job.", You need to hear yourself read this.," ""They held the recall election, and I lost.",""" ""I was voted out of office.",""" ""In 30 days, I will no longer be a Pawnee city councilor.",""" Oh, it's so hard to read when you're drunk.", Keep going.," ""But I am Leslie Knope.",""" ""I am more than a city councilor.",""" ""I am an unstoppable force of energy.",""" ""And I will use those days to work as hard as I can.",""" These are all your ongoing projects, everything you're currently working on for Pawnee.", You have things to do., You have a month left., Use it.," Ann, you poetic and noble land mermaid, you're right once again.", Thank you., I flushed my car keys down the toilet., No problem., Eww stop.," Hello to you too, April."," I'm sorry I said you were lame, okay? You are, but I know you were just trying to help me, so Thank you, April.", Happy Halloween.," And if you want to egg Larry's house, come find me.", You guys are cute., - Where'd that come from? - I'm weak.," I miss Andy, and it's making me weak."," Also, if Chris puts that much effort into making my stupid night better, I'm sure that he'll make your lame life perfect.", Or he's secretly super in love with me., It's probably that.," That's a funny joke, April."," But the truth is, I'm very much in love with Ann."," Okay, gross.", The spell's broken.," I've made my decision, and I'll sell you Rent-a-Swag, but on my terms."," Which are? $40,000 for the inventory, the website, and everything else in the store, but I keep the name Rent-a-Swag."," It's mine, and I'm keeping it.", The name is actually an important part of the sale., - Really? - Yes., My client likes the name., It's better than Tommy's Closet., He needs the name.," Well, I don't know what to tell you, except I'll throw in the name in exchange for $20,000 more and 5% of your client's business."," I'll run it past my client, but I think we have a deal."," Ron said there's nothing more valuable than my name, but he's not a businessman.", I am., And now I have seed money for my next venture.," I sold out, baby."," The votes have been counted, and I have been recalled."," I am, of course, disappointed."," But I am still your City councilwoman for 30 more days, and I intend to spend every second I have left working for you and this great city.", The thing about being part of the Leslie Knope emotional support task force is that it's a very easy job., She's never down for that long.," And now that she's had a little time to recharge, she is like a toddler bouncing back from a nap.", Hey! There you guys are.," Okay, Ben, I need some help with the re-zoning thing."," Also, I think we should paint our deck, so I have some color samples for you."," And to thank you both for being there when I needed you, I carved your faces into these Jack-o-lanterns."," Ann, it was very hard to capture your beauty, and, Ben, you make a sexy pumpkin No surprise.", Love you both., See you later., - Okay., - Wow., This is amazing., Not bad.,   ,"
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 08,"We're gonna have some fun tonight, Pawnee!",Who is ready to play 60?,Everybody on the field!,Yeah!,The NFL has a campaign to try to get kids active for 60 minutes per day.,"And so we bused in a hundred lucky, little buggers from Pawnee.",And they are gonna get a chance to play with the Colts.,Oh!,"Come on, Reggie!",I told you to run a button hook.,"I did, Leslie.",Okay.,I guess you would know.,"A pleasure to see you again, Mr.",Luck.,We met briefly last year  at our friend's bachelor party.,"Oh, yeah.",Right.,How are you?,"I normally don't answer that question, but since I respect your talent, I will tell you I am fine.","Hi, I'm April.",I stole your wallet.,You guys are weird.,Thank you.,"What's up, girl?","Keep walking, 98.",You don't even want to talk to that guy?,He plays for the NFL.,He's a linebacker.,Skill positions only for Donna Meagle.,"I got my Colts beanie, my Colts scarf, I got the Colts grill going, and the crowning glory Colts slippies.",How are you going to run in those?,"""Run""?",Tommy doesn't run.,That's your guys' job.,"Now, uh, let's go fetch this football throw, fellas.",I love sports.,"Check it out, Tom the Eagleton reservoir.",Isn't it stunning?,It's just a big dumb pond.,This morning I saw a YouTube clip of a little puppy riding a motorcycle.,"So my bar for ""stunning"" is pretty high.",What if I told you that this water has fluoride in it?,Then I would tell you the puppy had a little side car with a piggy in it named Hampton.,"First of all, send me a link to that video.","But more importantly, now that we have access to the Eagleton reservoir and the watertreatment supply, Pawnee is going to have fluoride in its water for the first time in our history, our oral history.",Nailed it.,Of course I'm upset that I lost the recall election.,But I'm just gonna spend the remainder of my term cramming in as many good projects as I can.,Lame duck?,Try flame duck 'cause this duck is on fire.,It's hard doing stupid government stuff now that RentaSwag's closed.,I'm a businessman.,That's what I was born to do.,"Well, look, you just got to make the most of the job that you have.","Like, take that trash collector.","It's not the most glamorous job in the world, but he's doing it with a smile on his face.","Oh, my God.",He's not wearing any pants.,What's wrong with him?,Let's get out of here.,He's smiling at us!,Let's go!,Run!,"What's so exciting, everyone?",Look what Ron made.,It's amazing.,"Several months ago, I was on a walk and found my crib tree.","I approached the tree, murdered it, left it to cure in my woodshop, and have begun working it into a crib for my upcoming child.","Ron Swanson, you cannot use this crib.",You're ignoring every known cribsafety standard.,It's all covered in the parenting book I'm reading.,Are you going to crawl my way?,By Lenny Kravitz.,My crib will be safe because I'm building it with my own two hands.,"I bought my crib in Bloomington, and I am confident that it is literally the safest crib in the explored universe.","Let me take you there, and you can talk to the salesperson.","Counteroffer you take me nowhere, and I talk to no one.","Countercounteroffer you come with me, or I make you attend a fourhour fax coversheet protocol meeting.","Either way, it's a win for me.",Next on the docket is a vote to approve the PawneeEagleton reservoir merger.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.",We're just goosing our water supply with fluoride?,"I mean, come on.",Are we really gonna force every Pawnee resident to ingest a chemical we know nothing about?,Fluoride is used by the communists to control our minds.,"No, it's not.",Fluoride can control minds?,"Like, you can use it to make ladies do stuff?",How am I the one that is getting booted off of this city council?,"Okay, fluoride is safe, it is good for you, and almost every town in America uses it.","Ah, all right.",You got me.,"I don't want fluoride in the water because I'm a dentist, and I like cavities.","Yeah, that is not a valid reason.","Pawnee's cavity problem is why a smalltown dentist, like me, can afford such a boss ride.",Got an Asian girl to sit in it once.,Why did we come out here?,"Come on, Jamm.",Fluoride in the water it's a nobrainer.,Can't you just let me have this one?,"No can do, Knopey.","As a matter of fact, I would like to propose my own bill the Pawnee Clean Water Bill, which prohibits adding anything to our water supply forever.","Jamm's not going to be able to kill this reservoir merger, is he?","On my side, I have facts, science, and reason.",All he has is fearmongering.,"Oh, my God, he's gonna win.","Yeah, people get jittery about stuff like this.",Remember last year when no one would get flu shots 'cause there was a rumor they turned you European?,"Well, I'll figure something out.","Oh, Jessica's here.",I better go.,"Okay, bye.","Hey, sugar butt.","Some lardos in Muncie ate tainted Sweetums toffee sticks and diarrhea'd so much, they ended up in the hospital.",Ugh.,"Can we give their school, like, a new seesaw or something?",Yeah.,Thanks.,The new site looks good.,Nice work.,"Oh, my God.",These dogs are so cute.,I want to throw up and kill myself.,Animal control had to take in all the pets from Eagleton.,"And Crazy Craig used to run all their shelters, so he helped me make an adoption website for all the dogs.",If you can look at that site and not want to take home you're basically a war criminal.,See the way that dog is rolling around in a puddle?,That's something Andy does when he gets hot.,"Oh, my God, you're right.",That is so Andy.,"Oh, my God.",That dog is totally Tom!,I don't know why.,It doesn't look like him.,But it just is.,It's like the dog is the essence of Tom.,"Okay, important meeting in the conference room right now.",We are going to all pick our spirit dogs.,"Oh, I've got to pick up Gayle at the airport.","Larry, I swear to God, if you leave right now, we will make your spirit dog a miniature schnauzer.",Is that bad?,Yes!,Get in there!,Ann found this place.,"It's where we bought our ""Sounds of Nature"" machine.",You bought a machine that replicates an open window?,Frasier!,Chris Traeger.,Do you remember me?,I came in here looking for the Vanna White book on child care I'd like to solve the puzzle of parenting.,"Could you show my friend, Ron, that amazing crib that you sold me?",The Babylove L'il Sweetheart Safe 4 Ever and Ever model.,"Oh, yeah, that thing is a deathtrap.",I'm sorry?,Just found out this morning it's being recalled.,They found maxicylofentabol in the glue.,Is that good?,It sounds bad.,It burned off my fingernails.,I'll be in the car.,"Councilwoman Leslie Knope wants to put fluoride, which is a chemical, into your drinking water.",You know what else is a chemical?,Strychnine and cyanide.,What?,And dirt and rust and even broken glass.,Exactly.,"You definitely understand what chemicals are, Perd.","I would suggest if you want to contact the psychopath that wants to turn your kids into badatmath, communist fluoride zombies, well, just call the number at the bottom of your screen.",Leslie Knope.,Stop right there.,You know what?,"Fluoride protects your teeth, and it's perfectly healthy for you.","Well, if Jamm says that, then he is a lying idiot, and if you believe it, then so are you.",Whoa.,You just talked to that person like I talk to you.,You can't do that.,Why not?,"What are they gonna do, kick me out of office?",Why did it take me so long to realize this?,There are no consequences to my actions anymore.,"No matter what I do, literally nothing bad can happen to me.","I'm like a white, male U.",S.,senator.,"Fluoride is going into the water, moron.",Oh.,"Hey, mom.",Sorry.,Because all it does is prevent cavities!,God!,I expected more from you.,Right.,I'm a loose cannon.,We need to fight fire with fire.,"I call a town hall meeting, I gather everyone together, I distribute the binders, but now the binders are bright yellow!",Om!,Too extreme?,Too nothing.,"Look, Jamm's already ruined fluoride.",Everyone's scared of it.,What if we just called it something else?,What do you mean?,I mean we rebrand.,No one cared about Calvin Broadus until he started calling himself Snoop Doggy Dogg.,"Then when people got tired of that, he went by Snoop Dogg, and now he's Snoop Lion.",What's he gonna be in ten yearsSnoop Laser Snake?,Who knows?,What are you saying we need to sex up fluoride?,"I don't know, Tom.",It's a pretty sexy topic already.,"Leslie, you got to give people something to get excited about.",You told me to make the most of my job.,I'm good at this stuff.,"Now, are you a loose cannon or not?",Yeah.,I'm as loose as a goose.,"Do your thing, Tom.",Aw.,"Now, remember, it's about finding a dog that captures your spirit.",See?,This is Craig.,"Oh, no!",That is insane!,I will burn this place to the ground if you pick that one!,"Okay, good choice.","You guys, Leslie.",Yes!,And Ron Swanson.,Oh!,"Oh, my God.",This is Larry.,That's great.,Bingo.,Donna.,Nailed it.,Ooh.,Because you're pretty and you like makeup and stuff.,Game over.,"Ron, I want to do things the Swanson way.",Wonderful.,First rule no conversation lasts longer than 100 total words.,You have used 9.,I have used 20.,Continue.,Fun.,I'd like you to teach me to build a crib.,Why do you need to build your own crib?,Because I no longer trust anything other than my own two hands.,"It is debilitating, but exciting.","Okay, we'll go to my woodshop at lunch.",Wonderful.,Look at us both standing on the cusp of fatherhood.,"I know we haven't spent a lot of time together,  but  100.","All right, so, in conclusion fluoride, chemical, tiny genitals, misinformation, panic, death, Jenny McCarthy.","Well, I don't know, councilman.",That was a little dry.,"What do you say we have some fun, huh?",Check this.,Plain water?,Yuck.,I'm bored.,Then try this.,What the what just happened?,"That water contains teeth dazzler, which makes your teeth stronger and starts a party in your mouth.",What?,"Fluoride's boring, guys.",Boo!,Welcome to Tdazzle.,It's not a chemical.,It's an aquaticbased socialmedia oral experience.,Everyone who tweets at Tdazzle in the next hour will be entered to win an exciting plain blue Tshirt.,"I say ""T,"" you say ""dazzle.","""  ""T.","""  Dazzle.","""T.","""  Dazzle.","""T.","""  Dazzle.","Thank you for the woodworking lesson, Ron.",This whole cribrecall thing has got me literally rethinking everything I thought I knew about parenting.,"What sleep method will you be using Ferber, Sears?","Swanson method, where you close your eyes and fall asleep.","I really wish Ron would engage, but he exudes so much wisdom that I can learn parenting tips simply by being in his presence.",Someone like Ron is teaching even when they're not teaching.,Does that make sense?,My anxiety has kept me up for over 50 hours.,"Our polling shows that 72% of citizens are in favor of adding Tdazzle to their water, effectively killing Councilman Jamm's socalled Clean Water Bill.","Eat it, Jamm.",I won.,Apology accepted.,"You know, I've actually come around to your way of thinking on this.","My only thought is, why stop here?","Ladies and gentlemen, Sweetums president Jessica Wicks.",Whoo!,"Look, we all love Tdazzle.",But we can do more to improve our drinking supply.,Sweetums is excited to propose an alternative to boring municipal water.,"We call it ""Drinkems""!",Whoo!,Sweetums is prepared to take over the management of Pawnee's water.,This is gonna save this town beaucoup bucks.,Take a sip of this delicious water and imagine it coming out of your faucets at home.,This water is filled with sugar.,There's absolutely no way we are doing this.,Checkmate.,Did you bring those with you just to do that?,Maybe.,Damn.,It is a baller move.,"What are we gonna do now, Leslie?",Hey.,"Okay, are you still mad at me about the poodle thing?",It was just a dumb game.,I can pick another dog.,I'm not mad about the choice.,I'm mad about your reasons.,"""Pretty,"" ""makeup"" is that all you know about me?",We don't hang out that much.,It's not like you know a ton about me.,"You're beautiful, yet cold and aloof.",You pride yourself on being a loner.,"You do not obey, you choose to cooperate.","And when you stop baring your fangs to pick a mate, it's for life.","And you're fiercely loyal to your pack, which makes you a rare black Siberian husky.","That was so spoton, it was scary.",I need to go lie down for 45 minutes.,"No, an hour a full hour.",Good morning.,This won't take long.,"Simply put, it would be madness to let Sweetums take over our water supply and pump it full of sugar.",What's next cookie dough toothpaste?,Bad example.,That would be amazing.,"My point is, Sweetums is an evil, profithungry corporation that is ruining our health.","Ever since Sweetums opened its doors, obesity is up 100%.",It's unacceptable.,Down with that poisonpeddling corporate monster.,Down with Sweetums!,Hey.,Hey.,Heard about your speech.,Sounded great.,I wish you could've seen it.,It felt so good.,I love loose cannoning.,"You know, I love the power of no consequences.","Well, unfortunately, there has been one consequence.",I just got fired from Sweetums.,Because you were embezzling I hope.,"Hey, Jessica!",Did you do something to your hair?,"Because, sister, you look good enough to eat.",Num num num num num.,"What do you want, Leslie?",You can't punish Ben for something I did.,It's not fair.,"I love him, and I will do anything to help him get his job back.",What do you want?,I want you to formally apologize for what you said about Sweetums.,"I want you to say that we're a moral, upstanding corporation that you're proud to have in Pawnee.","And when you make your apology, I want you to wear a limegreen pantsuit because it will look horrible on you.",You are such an autumn.,Did you need me for something?,"Yes, I want to figure out your spirit dog, and I'm going to do that by learning everything there is to know about you.",All right.,Game on.,"Okay, what's your favorite color?","For cars, it's gold.","For shoes, it's red unless it's the weekend, then reverse them.",Favorite music?,"1970s funk and 1770s opera and Sugar Ray, post Mark McGrath after he left for Entertainment Tonight.",Favorite book?,Downton Abbey.,That's not a  DowntonAbbey.,Okay.,"Um, describe your perfect Sunday.","Church, do the Harper's Magazine Acrostic, play my oboe in the jacuzzi while the sun sets over puget sound.",Favorite movies?,"In order Natural Born Killers, Remains of the Day, and Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey.",Excellent.,Thank you very much for your time.,I will have your answer shortly.,No idea.,"If a joint is properly fashioned, all you need to do is guide it into place.","""All you need to do is guide it into place.",""" What I get from that is, when parenting, sometimes a subtle hand is more effective than a strong one.",This is already so much more helpful than the last book on parenting I read Rad Dads by Apolo Anton Ohno and Shaun White.,Nah.,"Ron, why did you throw that wood away?",It's unstable.,It's no good.,"I just don't understand ""the throwing away the wood"" metaphor.",What's the lesson?," Oh, I know!", It's pottytraining.," That trash can is the toilet, and the wood was the feces."," Chris, I'm not teaching you anything.", We're just building a crib.," No, I know you're not consciously teaching me anything."," I'm trying to siphon off some of your calm, centered wisdom through metaphors.", Metaphors? I hate metaphors.," That's why my favorite book is Moby Dick-- no froufrou symbolism, just a good, simple tale about a man who hates an animal."," That's enough for today, I think.", - An organized child is a-- - No.," Okay, I've been working on this for three hours, and I know your spirit dog."," You are a Nova Scotia toller, because you're outgoing and adventurous."," And you love Canada? - No, that's not right."," - No, it isn't.", But I appreciate the effort., We're good., And don't beat yourself up., You'll probably never guess what kind of dog I am., You're right.," I'll never guess what kind of dog you are, because you're not a dog.", You're a cat., You're temperamental.," You're unpredictable, complex, and hard to read.", You make people work before you let them in.," But if they put the time in and prove that they care, then you open yourself up to them."," Right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no.", Hmm.," ""So let's all raise a glass, ""full of delicious, sugary drinking water, to Sweetums-- a Pawnee Institution.",""" Leslie, don't do this."," I have to, Ben.", We can't both be out of a job.," What will we do-- sleep all day, take cooking classes together, sit on a couch and watch movies? - God, that sounds horrible.", - There's more at stake here.," I mean, you apologize, it'll be an endorsement - for the Drink-ems plan."," - I know that, but-- And everything you said about Sweetums was right on."," I mean, 90% of the charity work I did was to compensate for messes they caused.", And I don't want to work for them anymore.," Are you sure? Yeah, just go up there, stick to your guns.", It's not gonna make a difference., I can't beat them.," All I have on my side is facts and science, and people hate facts and science.", Wait., I have an idea., Go get Tom., Run! Get Tom! Yesterday I said some pretty harsh things about Sweetums and their great new product.," But when I looked at the research, I found some pretty compelling facts about Drink-ems that made me change my tune.", Each Drink-ems is packed with 35% of your daily monopotassium phosphate requirement., MPP is an emulsifier as well as a plus-7 PH buffer.," Now, I know what you're thinking-- what about its molar mass? How does 136.","086 grab you? What the-- I don't know about y'all, but Drink-ems seems pretty boring to me, not like H-2-flow.", Excuse me., I have several binders with very important data that I need to get through.," Well, miss, I think we'd all appreciate it if you just swallowed a teaspoon of hush.", Think of H-2-flow as an app for your teeth.," The more flow you take in, the more sparkle points you get."," Get enough sparkle points, and you're on your way to your first aqua badge! Collect enough aqua badges, and we'll welcome you to the H-2-flow Platinum Club."," I'm great at business, and I'm great at parks stuff.", I'm like Picasso meets Michael Jordan.," I can paint, but, uh, I can also be a world-class gambler."," Ron, what's this? The crib I built.", I'm giving it to you and Ann., It's perfectly safe., I tested it by hitting it with my truck.," Well, Ron, I can't accept.", This is for your baby., There's more than one crib tree in a forest.," That's not a lesson, by the way, just a comment on lumber availability.", It's beautiful., Thank you.," Nobody has all the right answers in parenting, including me.", And that toxic crib you bought won't be the last mistake you make., But a man who's this worried about making all the right choices cares very much., That's all that matters., You'll be a great father.," Thank you, Ron for the crib and the advice.", It's much better than any metaphor., Does the white whale actually symbolize the unknowability and meaninglessness of human existence? No., It's just a [bleep] fish.," Hey, good news.", Drink-ems is dead.," As of tomorrow, every Pawnee resident will have H-2-flow in their drinking water.", That's great news.," H-2-flow is fluoride, right? I think so."," I'll double-check with Tom, but I'm, like, 95% sure.", Wow., Look at us.," Two people, who are about to have zero jobs."," Weird, huh? And you and I-- we always land on our feet, right? - Yeah.", - Uh-oh! Guess who won that plain blue T-shirt? No way! Look how blue it is., Wow., Things are already looking up., Yeah!   ,"

disguise.","I took a job at this accounting firm, they've tried to hire me three times, I finally gave in.","But I've had a week off in between jobs, and I've been cooking up something pretty big.","The last time he was in between jobs, he got deep into claymation, so this should be different, hopefully.","Presenting ""The Cones of Dunshire,"" a brandnew gaming experience.","Two wizards, a Maverick, the arbiter, two warriors, a corporal, and a ledgerman.","Now, the ledgerman just keeps score, and he wears this hat.","Oh, boy.","Now, the object is to accumulate cones.","Four cones wins, but in order to get a cone, you have to build a civilization.",The other amazing thing is the challenge play.,"Actually, let me tell you more about the trivia cards, 'cause you're gonna need to know about roadblocks first.","Nah, never mind.",The thing about the challenge play is that it's basically the gamein reverse.,Then you roll three dice to see how many dice you roll with.,"Oh, 16.","Perfect, lots of choices.","Okay, each turn goes: Roll, buy, action.","I mean, obviously, this would be much taller in the real game.",But the corporal can veto.,This should be green too.,How did this happen?,Are the cones a metaphor?,"Well, yes and no.",What is this called again?,"""The Cones of Dunshire.",""" Oh, my God, the Maverick should be able to trade lumber for agriculture credits.",How have I not thought of this before?,"This is nothing, right?",When do you go back to work again?,Tomorrow.,It's fine.,I'll just throw this in the garbage.,"As soon as Knope is gone, these are going up all over Chambers.",Jamm for three!,Ha ha!,"What, are you trying to build a house with those bricks?",Ooh!,The girl is attacking me.,Any new business before we adjourn?,"Yes, I have one the Pawnee Commons.","Oh, boy.","The money for the Pawnee Commons, aka the greatest future park in the world, aka my personal dream project Aka Is currently in a discretionary fund.","I'd like to move it to a lockbox, to ensure that it is used for that project.","The thing is, Leslie, this kind of decision is it's not really up to you anymore.","Because the voters, to use a technical political term, gave you the stanky boot.","But we'll keep your money safe, baby girl.","What, you think I'm gonna use it to put a new limestone shower in my office?","Yeah, now I do.","I propose that we table this discussion until, let's say, the second Knope is gone.","Later, bunheads.",Glass!,Video Ron demand.,"What you carrying, my dude?",The time has come to sell my cabin.,But I haven't had much luck finding a buyer.,"""For sale.",Small house.,Location: Forest.,""" It's a little wordy, don't you think?","""Current owner will not clean up shotgun shells or animal carcasses.",""" The hell is wrong with you, Swanson?","Fine, I'll clean up the shotgun shells, but the carcasses remain to fertilize my berry patch.","If you really want to unload that little horror cabin, you gonna need a professional to stage it properly.","Lucky for you, I recently got my real estate license.",Spladow!,Check it.,"""Regal Meagle Realty.",""" ""Find your castle.",""" Fine, I suppose I could use some help.","Yo, Donna, let me get a little skin in the game, maybe split that commission?",All right.,Show me what you got.,I'll split that commish.,"Split that commish The question I always ask myself is, what kind of mogul should I be?","Fashion mogul, energy drink mogul.",I even thought about downhill skiing.,A mogul mogul.,But a real estate mogul?,Hmm.,That's a hot mogul right now.,"Ben Wyatt, reporting for duty.","How you doing, Barney?",Good to see you again.,I just can't believe it's finally happening.,Dad!,He's here!,He really came!,"Hello, Ben.",I'm Frank.,I took the job when you passed it up last time.,Heard a lot about you.,"Well, all good things, I hope.",A little too good.,Let's see if you live up to the hype.,I'm not joking.,Oh.,Frank seems cool.,"Well, tell everybody in Michigan I said hi, and tell your mom that I love the banana cake she posted on Pinterest.","Oh, the father of your child is here.",I have to go.,I'll talk to you soon.,I love you.,Was that Ann?,I hope you were speaking to her in a calming voice 'cause babies can hear everything.,"Baby, if you can still hear me, I love you.",The phone is hung up.,Oh.,You got my message about Jamm being a dinkhead?,"Yes, but as city manager, I can't play sides.",And I think all of our heads can be a little dinky at times.,"Fine, but his is the dinkiest.",And I would know because I'm keeping score.,"Ever since I started city council, I have gone headtohead with Jamm 112 times.","He has won 56 times, I have won 56 times.",I will not lose our last battle.,Will you help me?,No.,Oh.,"The way you stood up like that, I thought it was gonna go a different way.","No, I can't help directly, but I am on your side.",And I will assist you in any way that I can.,"Maybe I can mediate, like Dr.","Phil, only qualified.","So what's the story, Ron?",Diane making you sell this place?,Not at all.,"Recently, I purchased a new cabin big enough for the whole family.",I just can't justify owning four cabins.,Two cabins.,"The new cabin I bought has a great tire swing for the girls, access to a lake for all the kids to play in.","Plus, it doesn't have these razorsharp perimeter defense planks sticking out of the ground.","I usually get a 5% commission, but I'll do it for 3%.",Friends and family discount.,Make it 5%.,I don't want you getting any ideas about us being friends.,Respect.,"Donna, baby.","For the fireplace, I'm thinking fake antlers.",But what kind of scarves do we want to hang off the fake antlers?,"Oh, duh.",Crocheted.,Most def.,"That'll look legit next to those antique ""Visit France"" posters.",Mm.,"Ron, you want to stay outside and do nothing while they make your cabin look like garbage?",I'd like that very much.,We can watch the shadows get longer.,Okay.,"Wow, you guys sure take the startup paperwork seriously around here.","Sorry to start you out like this, and on a Friday no less.",But it's our toughest case.,"Three competing family trusts, a contested will it's a real puzzler!","So let's see what you got, genius.","If I'm murdered tonight, start the investigation with those two guys.",The hell you nerds doing here?,We're not done talking about the lockbox.,This isn't over.,And I am here to mediate.,You can't just show up at my door like this.,"Look, I know we have had our differences, but this is very important to me.",And I'm not leaving until we hash this out.,"I respect the moxie, Knope.",You can come in for a minute.,Shoes off.,This is a house of respect.,"Well, I don't need to do that.",My feet are very clean.,"No shoes, you lose.","""No shoes, you lose""?","That means we should have shoes then, right?",No shoes Hmm.,"Yeah, so this is my weekend dojo.","Sorry, the place is a bit of a mess.",My wife's in Oklahoma for eight months.,Maybe forever.,We'll see if she forgives me.,"Who's that, Michelle Wie?",It's not sexual.,I'm just a really big fan of her game.,Really?,Yeah.,"Because in that picture, she's wearing a bikini.","Yeah, thanks.",Photoshopped it myself.,Fantastic.,"Well, this is about the time I hit the hay, so Why don't we all hit the hay?","We'll stay here, get a good night's sleep, and we can start negotiations tomorrow.",We stopped at the outlet mall on the way here.,"Got ourselves a sleeping bag, a giant tin of caramel corn, and an irregular skirt from DKNY.","The hem is crooked, but it was 8 bucks.","The point is, I am not leaving until I get that lockbox.","Oh, playing hardball, huh?","Hey, no sweat off my sack.","You can take the couch, if you can get my exercise equipment out of the way.",I think I can handle it.,"How sweet is this table, by the way, huh?",I got it from an actual benihana.,Cost me 4 grand.,Worth every penny.,Hai!,Can I interest anyone in an authentic aJapanese abreakafast?,Scrambled eggs eaten with chopsticks?,Okay.,Hai!,"You know, maybe we should negotiate  while we're eating.","No, what's the rush?",Plenty of time for that later.,You know what might put you in the mood to talk is a couple of brewskis and a calendar featuring some of your favorite female wrestlers.,"Oh, yeah.","Knope, you know the way to a man's heart.","Yeah, okay.",Let's talk.,You got it.,These people won't leave.,One guy even looked in the bathroom.,"Yeah, that means they like the place.","If you just leave them alone, I think we might get some offers.",This evergreen scented candle should help put people in the mood to buy.,You could just open the door and let the actual smell of the pines in.,"Trees are sticky, and they got bugs in them.",This place is so random.,I don't know.,"It's kind of, like, in the middle of nowhere.",I know.,"That's, like, the hilarious part.",It's like a joke how long it takes to get here.,It's like a metacabin.,Oh yeah.,"That's what I thought, yeah.",I heard that Dave Eggers wrote a short story about this tape cassette that he found under that tree over there.,"Oh, my God.",What are you doing?,I'm trying to get these annoying dumdums to pay more money for your cabin.,Carry on.,"Oh, my God, I heard that Neko Case and Ben Gibbard made out here once.",What?,Saturday at the firm with Ben.,"Okay, we dissolve the loanout and file bankruptcy.",That way only our clients have claim to the assets.,Great idea that we had a month ago.,"The problem is, the trust still has claim to the property.",Then we dissolve the trust.,"Clients ""A,"" ""B,"" and ""F,"" they would have to agree, but if they went for it, we could arbitrate.",He's right.,We never thought of that.,"Oh, oh!","Ben, Ben.","Say it again but this time I'm gonna turn the light on, like you just had an idea.","Sure, sure.","Yeah, I'm with you.","Um, okay.",What if we dissolve the trust?,Yes!,You just cracked the case.,I'm just doing my job.,"Okay, here's an idea.","Maybe we name part of the park  the ""Jamm Zone""?",Hmm.,"Yeah, Jamm could dig on that.","How about if in the Jamm zone, there's no married chicks allowed?","Caution, Jeremy.","I think there are people that will find the ""No Married Chicks"" zone both morally repugnant and hard to enforce.",All right.,"Listen, let us celebrate this progress by sharing these authentic edamame, or Tokyo beans.",Now I want you to be very careful about eating these.,"You eat the shells, and you throw the seeds out.",Wow.,You have really immersed yourself in Asian culture.,Now I think maybe we should revisit the holding bond idea.,"Ugh, Lezzie.","Come on, I'm getting bored.","I mean, we've been at this for hours.",Can we please take a break?,Perhaps he has a point.,And we've made some progress.,Maybe we go home and take the rest of it up on Monday.,"No, I cannot wait until Monday.",I need to close this deal now.,So I have an idea.,Let's have a change of venue and keep negotiating while we have fun.,"If I remember correctly, you enjoy the ancient art of karaoke, yes?",I do.,And kudos on that pronunciation.,I remembered your favorite duet.,Maybe it's time to take this party to Rydell High.,Whoa!,I cannot wait to hear your Travolta.,"Oh, no, no, no.",I'm Sandra Dee.,That's more of my register.,You're Zuko.,"He got friendly, holdin' my hand   She got friendly down in the sand   He was sweet, just turned 18   Well, she was good, you know what I mean?","Uh  summer heat boy and girl meet   but ah, oh, those summer nights  I would like to buy five DVDs of this.","No, 20.","No, 60!","No, that's insane.",Dubee doo dubee doo  dubee dubee dubee dow  Good news.,We have multiple bidders.,That guy's getting his financials together.,"Plans on tearing the whole place down, just wants it for the land.",Why would he want to tear down a perfectly good cabin?,"I think he's a developer, wants to put in a luxury glampground.","Glamping is ""glamour camping.",""" Heated tents, catered meals, wifi You're describing a hotel.",And I think we still have traction with those two.,"Oh, hey, man.",I love the mustache.,So funny.,"You ever think about twisting it up at the ends, huh?",Use a little beeswax?,The open house is now closed.,We are not accepting bids at this time.,The sun sets in 95 minutes.,Good day.,That's part of the charm of this whole place the cantankerous old coot who owns it.,It's authentic!,"I gotta say, that was pretty fun up there.","We have fun when we collaborate, right?",Working together?,"Lockbox, right?","You know, in some weird, perverted, sexual way, I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.",Oh.,You are my Nemesis.,You're the Superman to my Lex Luthor.,You want to be Lex Luthor?,"Uh, yeah.",Lex Luthor is rich.,"Well, okay.",I can't argue with that.,So I did Zuko for you.,Now you give me the lockbox.,"Leslie put a beautiful cross into the box, Jeremy.",Time for you to head it in.,"All right, Knope.",What can I say?,You wore me down.,"I will give you my word, and I will put it in writing, so I can't back out.",We won't touch the money for one year.,"And if the economy holds up, you can start construction then.","Leslie, you have your lockbox.",And you scored a triple dragon on your song.,"No, I cannot wait a year.",I want to get started now.,I want construction started on Monday.,You have his word.,"And this is riddled with spelling errors,  but it is binding.",It's not good enough!,"Jamm, I sang your stupid song, I ate your stupid fake Asian food, and by the way, you should know, you don't make sushi rolls out of tuna salad Maybe you don't.","I did practically everything you wanted, and you won't just give this to me today?",Screw you!,You're giving a card to me?,You left me no choice.,"Oh, my God!","Oh, my God!","Please, could you excuse us?","Leslie, you should be happy!",You beat Jamm in the final battle.,Unless there's something more going on here.,Ann.,This is about Ann.,Ann Perkins?,I love Ann Perkins.,Pawnee Commons is why I met Ann five years ago.,And I know you guys are talking about moving.,"But I guess I thought if maybe Ann came back from Michigan tomorrow, and I was able to look into her smoky, ethnically ambiguous eyes and tell her that we were breaking ground on a new park, she might  she might want to stay.","Leslie, I'm sorry.",Ann didn't just go to Ann arbor to visit family.,She went to sign the lease on our new home.,Ann arbor sounds disgusting.,She already has family there.,And I have a new job lined up at the University of Michigan.,Go blue!,It's a good town.,And it's a great place to raise a family.,What is great about it?,There's no JJ's Diner there.,"There's no ""Welcome to Pawnee"" sign.","I mean, the stupid state is split up into two pieces!",It's ridiculous.,"Unexpected play here, Superman.","Not exactly sure what you're going for, but I dig your Gambit.","There is no Gambit here, Jamm.","And who sides with Lex Luthor, by the way?",You probably watch Million Dollar Baby and root for the stool.,I haven't seen it.,Not a big Morgan Freeman guy.,I find his voice very grating.,I am leaving now.,I am not moving.,I'm just going home.,Are you guys coming back to my place?,What'swhat's or are you guys going back to we wrapping up the weekend?,No?,Need a cup to perk me up  coffee in the morning  Surprise!,"Oh, my God!",I hope you don't mind.,We decided to throw you a pizza party to say congrats for cracking the case.,"Oh, my God, you guys.",See what we got here.,Wait a second.,That's not pizza.,Those are calzones!,I love calzones!,We know!,I think it's safe to say I made the right choice.,"What's up, guys?",Hey!,BFF slideshow?,"You know that even after we leave Pawnee, Ann will always be your best friend.",And it's not that long a trip.,"Well, it would be even faster if the governor would return my calls about my PawneetoAnn arbor bullet train idea.","You know, I went to Jamm's with you because I also want to leave the right kind of legacy, and that includes Pawnee commons.","Well, I think I burned that bridge with Jamm.", We're not gonna get that lockbox., And I am not singing Beauty School Dropout.," It's sexist, and I don't do slow jams.", I have an idea., And I'd like you to consider it a good-bye gift from me to you.," No, thank you.", I will let him know., That was that couple you liked at the open house., I despised them.," Well, they just came back with a new offer and jacked that shizz up.", Way over asking price.," Ron, who cares who they are? That's a massive bid.", I'ma be a mogul., I bought that cabin I do not care about the money., I can't even understand what you're saying right now.," That cabin served an important purpose for me, as a quiet refuge from the nonsense of modern life.", I'd like the next owners to understand and share that purpose.," Find me someone like that, and I'll happily sell.", I'll buy it., You can't afford that house., Can you afford that house? What would you use it for? I'd go up there and take Andy and Champion and just get away from everyone else and look at spiders., And it's where I'd bury the bodies of that annoying couple after I murder them., Here's my offer., I will give you everything in my purse.," $8, a bunch of loose cough drops, and Larry's asthma inhaler.", Thank God., I've been looking for that.," Larry, this is part of a real estate transaction now.", You have no legal claim to it.," Sorry, I had no idea.", This is the best offer I've heard yet.," Uh, you tripping right now.", Sold., Don't even trip., Your commission., Thanks a lot.," Your share, mogul."," I'm about to play golf with a guy who was almost on The Apprentice, so this better be good."," You give Leslie her lockbox, and you get me in your hip pocket."," Starting in my next term as city manager, I will give you one huge I.",O.,U.,", no questions asked.", Hmm., Jamm likes the sound of that., Let's make it five I.,O.,U.,"s, and you got a deal."," You drive a hard bargain, but you leave me no choice.", Fine., Five huge IOUs.," Deal, guys.", You must really want that park., I do., Yes.," And to tell you the truth, I'm doing it all for my best friend.", That's all I wanted to hear.," Leslie, you're my best friend too."," Well, vote passed.", 3-2., Jamm is gonna be so pissed when he finds out that you're leaving and your I.,O.,U.,s are worthless.," Are you sure you're okay with what you did? Well, it's not the most ethical thing that I've ever done, but on the flip side, Jamm is a big, mean dope.", - Mm-hmm., - And I hope that this eases some of the pain of us moving away a little bit.," Oh, I'm currently in deep denial that that's happening."," Speaking of which, how's the new gig coming? Well, I got a raise, and my fridge is full of calzones, so not complaining.", The reason I ask is this town is gonna need a new city manager.," And I've talked to some people, and you have the votes if you want the job.", Wh-- Seriously? Is this for realskis? This is 100% certified for realskis.," - What do you say? - I mean, I--wow.", I would be insane to say no.," Oh, no."," Wyatt, you're late."," I'm just kidding, you can do whatever you want."," Actually, Barney, I'm afraid I have some bad news.", Today's my last day.," I got an opportunity I couldn't say no to, and I have to quit.", Again., No need to explain., I knew it was too good to be true.," Oh, I do have a little going-away gift.", Left it in the break room.," If anyone could appreciate it, it's you guys."," ""You can play with one warrior, ""but it's just not nearly as good.", Enjoy., Ben Wyatt.,""" Let's play.", - I call ledgerman! - No.,   ,"

an efficient use of the free market.,"I would wish you the best of luck,  but I believe luck is a concept  invented by the weak to explain their failures.","Come hear the ideas with me, Ron.","I could use your wise, grandfatherly advice.",Do you think everyone here is a grandfather?,"Basically, if you're older than me, you're a grandpa.","And if you are a grandpa, you're dead.",That

of our time there,  and then I'll file the campaign form from that address.","I don't want to spend 51% of our time in his district,  it's basically a dumping ground for old shipping containers.",Oh.,It's like a raccoon shanty town.,"Oh, it's not that bad.","And also, Dexhart fights dirty.","He's never lost an election because he runs brutal, scorched earth campaigns.",So what?,"I've got plenty of dirt  on that scumbag, I say bring it on.","So, I'm going to start my negative PR blitz against Dexhart and  Look, I just think we need to take a deep breath,  think about

did was punch ""jewelry store"" into our car GPS.","You remember that romantic moment, Chris?",I was getting gas.,"No, I don't remember it.","Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed.",Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.,"Yeah, flipped through it.",Looks good.,Huh.,You're lying.,"I placed a single strand of hair along the edge, and that secret strand is unbroken.",Whose hair is that?,It's brown.,"Look, it seems like you don't even care about your presentation.",Au contraire.,I'm working on it right now.,And what's the most important part of a presentation?,Content.,The presentation.,Okay.,"Tom, you need hard data.",You need facts to make your case.,And then you need two funny quotes and an inspirational one.,"You know, a classic hahahmm.","Look, I think you need to take a page out of my system and chill out a bit, okay?",I got this.,"Okay, fine, I trust you.","But I think you're gonna fail, and you're a ticking time bomb.",What's that?,"Nothing, good luck.",This is an elk hair.,Yes.,It's the most effective hair for binder security.,"You know that, Ron.","If Tom gives that presentation, it is going to be a total disaster for both him and the department.",I cannot sit idly by and watch this terrible thing happen.,"I mean, I can barely sit idly by and watch good things happen.","We've got a couple of customs agents coming down from the border, and they are not happy.",I can't believe this.,I never break the law.,I've never even jaywalked.,Never?,"I mean, III everyone does it sometimes.",Just add that to the charges.,"Well, well, well, we got a hit on your prints.",Seems you're wanted for tax fraud in Colorado?,What?,I've never even been to Colorado.,"I mean, I had a layover in Denver once.","Man, you can't keep your story straight, can you?",Come on!,Oh.,Here comes the customs guys now.,"Fellas, he's all yours.",You're pranked.,You gotta see the stupid look on your face.,Check this out.,I took a picture.,Classic!,You seemed a little uptight.,Thought we'd have some fun with our new boss.,Wow.,Thiyou got me.,"Good one, makin' me think I was gonna like die in federal prison Ah, that's super funny, you scamps.","Now, Stu, I know that you're thinking about retiring, and I am here to ask you to reconsider.",What do you say?,"Keep that Lafayette Park stand open, pumpin' out the stew like you do.",I don't know.,"I'm looking forward to spending time with my wife, working on some new hobbies.",I was thinking about getting into bisques.,"Stu, you have been a staple in the parks department system for years.",Retirement is for the birds.,You're gonna be so bored.,I'm gonna say this because you need to hear it.,Screw bisque.,That makes a lot of sense.,Yeah.,What now?,What do I do?,"Well, we're gonna need to convince the business council to keep you around, but that's not for you to worry about.",I'll take care of it.,You just keep on stewin' what you stew.,"Thanks, Leslie.",This calls for a toast.,Susan?,"Stew flutes, please.",Ah.,To stew.,Mm.,"Oh, my God.",That's very hot.,Mmhmm.,Congratulations.,This is a beauty.,"If you like, I could engrave the date on the inside of the band.","That may be tough, 'cause we actually haven't discussed it yet.","We could engrave ""2014""  or ""TBD.","""  Hang on.","If neither of us has ever thought about this stuff, then maybe there's a reason.","When you think about it, we are already more married than most married people.",Right?,"I mean, we're having a child together.",We're moving to a new city.,You let me pee with the door open so I could watch the end of Grey's Anatomy.,That was a fantastic season finale and a show that is literally a neverending roller coaster of emotion.,"I mean, why spend thousands of dollars just to reaffirm what we already know, which is that we love each other?",That is so beautiful.,"Theodore, we would like to return that ring.","And get a refund, please.",Maybe we should talk this over too.,"Oh, come on.",Think what we could do if we didn't buy this ring.,"I mean, this could go towards buying a house.",You have a lovely store.,"Hey, boss?",Hey.,"I was just printing out my minesweeper high score, and I noticed this memo.",You're punishing us for the prank?,"No, no, no, no, no, no.",It's just like a warning memo.,"Like, ""Hey, all in good fun, ""but I'm your boss, and if you do it again, you're suspended.","""  That kind of thing.",Listen.,"I know that you're the governor or whatever, and I'm just government junior.",What?,I feel like you're blowing it.,"If you want people to like you, you have to play along.",Don't punish Donna and April.,Prank them back.,"I guess I could stand to loosen up a little, but I don't know how to pull a prank.","Dude, okay.","Well, I could help you.",Yeah?,Yeah.,I once did the best prank of all time.,I dumped all of my boss's action figures  into a fish tank.,"Yeah, that was me.",And I didn't really like it.,Classic.,"Great news, guys.",I just saved your bacon.,Impossible.,You don't even know where it is.,"I know you were excited to get in front of the committee and rip it, but in the spirit of teamwork, I unilaterally decided to bring Stu out of retirement.",So pressure's off.,What?,I spent a lot of time on this.,"Doin' what,  putting mousse in your hair?",It's a gelbased serum.,"Second of all, who uses mousse still?","Oh, God.",Leslie.,Let's put our differences aside for a second.,"Friend to friend, do you still use mousse?","No, I use the juicy space thingwhatever you do.","The point is you weren't ready for this, Tom.",Stu's sales are flat.,Lemonade's the future.,I'm still doing my presentation.,"I'm still doing my stew presentation, and we'll see which one the committee likes.",Fine.,Fine.,Yeah.,I didn't think so.,"On the other hand, there are some benefits to being married: Taxes, health insurance, and I don't have to feel weird when hotel employees call me ""Mr.",Perkins.,""" Yeah, that makes me feel weird too.",Maybe we should.,I don't know anymore.,"""Maybe we should.",I don't know anymore.,""" Ann, that is a beautiful sentiment.","Okay, you're all set.",Credit card's been fully refunded.,Perfect timing.,We are going to buy this ring.,Charge it.,"Ann Perkins, will you marry me?",I don't know!,Me either!,Maybe let's not?,"Yeah, I think maybe not.",Okay.,Ring's yours again.,Hello?,"Actually, we don't want the ring.",Unbelievable.,"Leslie, look.","I'm the last person to want to deprive the world of more stew, but are you sure you wanna do this?","Look, I love Tom, but you and I both know that he's not ready to step up.",Don't you remember his last presentation on topsoil?,The botched laser show?,Larry still can't see purple.,That was Larry's fault.,He picked up the laser and stared right into it.,"I know, but still, Tom is all flash  and no substance.",That's the old Tom.,"You've been gone for a while, Leslie.",Tom has changed.,"He ran a business, sold it for a profit.","He's also been working here for six years, and he's learned a lot from you.","At some point, you're gonna have to trust him to do his job.",You guys.,You guys.,Be cool.,What's going on?,"I kind of convinced Ben to prank you guys, and it got a little out of hand.","I probably should've said no to some of his ideas, but he's on his way here right now.",Here he is.,Just be cool.,"Hey, guys.",What's up?,"Um, oh, I just remembered.",Can I show you something out to the front area?,And leave your cell phones because of no reason.,"Just leave anything that can't get wet, actually, like you would normally.","Okay, here we go to the parking lot now.","Wow, this is really sad.","Yep, follow to me, guys.",Just going to the parking lot for normal government reasons.,"Sorry, can't go through with this.",I was gonna pull a prank.,No!,Yeah.,"I hired these guys in ski masks to kidnap us, and I was gonna pretend to be a hero.","They were gonna shoot me and drive the van into the river, and that's when the divers would go in, pull you guys out of the water, and I would be standing on the shore like, ""Hey, you get pranked much?",""" What the?","I even got these squibs from a special effects guy, and I was gonna say this code word.",And that's when I would push this button.,"No, no, no, no, no!","Oh, my God.",You got blood all over me.,Thank you.,I mean it.,"Ben, that was amazing.",Really?,Best prank ever.,"I'm sorry, buddy, daddy can't get home to tuck you in."," Oh, how old is your son? Just pick a thing."," Honey, look at this.", This is what I want., I don't want a ring., I don't want a wedding., I just want this locket with a picture of our child in it.," I mean, we've never been traditional.", We made out the first night we ever met.," And when we did date, we broke up, but you didn't realize it, and that was very embarrassing for you."," Yeah, let's maybe not talk about that part right now."," And then we got pregnant as friends, and then we fell in love."," We've never been very conventional, so why start now? Theodore? We will not be needing that ring, but we would like to purchase this locket.", How much? Just take it and get outta here., - Thank you! - Thanks., We're here to discuss a business contract for the Lafayette Park food stand.," Miss Knope, you've always steered this committee in the right direction."," Why do you think we should renew Hot Stu's lease? Well, frankly, it's because of Stu."," Here's a man who was ready to retire, spend time with his family, travel."," And then he realized, ""No, I wanna spend my time ""in a small metal box all summer, bent over a boiling cauldron of steaming, bubbling meat.",""" Making stew is hard: Up at the crack of dawn, backbreaking labor, your clothes smelling like salt and gristle."," Sure, profits are minimal, but Stu doesn't care about that.", Maybe a year extension isn't enough., Maybe we should make it five years.," Heck, why don't we give him a lifetime deal? I'd like to see Stu ladling out his pungent beef smoothies until we bury him under that shed.", I think I've made a terrible mistake.," Okay, that was bleak."," Uh, Mr."," Haverford, you have a presentation as well? Hey.", Rip it., There's nothing more American than lemonade., Just sayin' the word makes you wanna drink some., And now you can., Check under your seats.," Heh, hey.", Has my name on it.," Yes, it does."," Classic for you, Carter."," Darva, yours is a pink lemonade.", - I know you love that., - Because I like pink., That's right.," Now, who here likes laser shows? Summer foot traffic in Lafayette Park has increased 23%.", The Indiana Brothers are the fastest-growing beverage company in the Midwest., My projections show they can increase government revenue 30% over the next five years.," Plus, they've agreed to waive their franchise fee."," Look, guys, I'm sorry about all the new rules, But--you know, I want you to like me.", But I-I also really need you to respect me.," I respect you, little buddy.", Come here.," Mm, respect noogie.", Ah! We didn't prank you 'cause we don't respect you., We did it 'cause we love you.,"  R-e-s-p-e-g-c Well, that's actually not how respect is spelled.", - Yes.," - According to Urethra Franklin, that's exactly how it's spelled."," Hey, Wyatt.", You were a good sport earlier., No hard feelings? Here's a little gift for you for believing in me., - Oh., - It's a gel-based hair serum.," Enough with the mousse, for real.", Okay.," Well, Ron, you were right.", Tom has really grown up., You seem merely overjoyed instead of irritatingly ecstatic.," - Why? - Well, Tom's come into his own.", April runs Animal Control.," I mean, does this department even need me anymore? No.", We do not., April and Tom started out as two of the most apathetic people I had ever met., It's why I hired them., Then you betrayed me and turned them into efficient and caring government employees., This office can indeed function without you.," And soon, it'll have to.", Was that a death threat? We both know you're not gonna be here forever., This is a weigh station on the road to bigger and better things.," Whenever you do move on, it should please you to know that-- God help me-- you've built a well-functioning government agency."," Oh, that reminds me."," I know you don't open your mail, but I do."," And because you created Tom's position-- business liaison-- and it's already financially paying off, you have received Pawnee's government employee of the month."," I mean, it has taken--   ","
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 12,"I've got to say that this report is quite impressive, Miss Knope.","Thank you very much, Mr.",City Manager.,And I have to say that the way that you're rockin' those slacks is quite impressive as well.,"Well, thank you.","Can we hurry this up, please?",What?,"There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the fantastic work of one of your employees, especially if she's adorable.","I am back at the parks department, and Ben is city manager, but we're married, so it's kosher.",And awesome.,We live together  And work together.,And we are so In sync That we finish each other's Sentences!,We rehearsed that at home.,Naked in bed.,What!,What!,Please stamp the form.,I just want to admire it one more time.,"Again, fantastic work.","In fact, such good work I think I'm in love with you.","Oh, my God, that's great news, 'cause I'm in love with you too.",What?,What?,Stamp the form.,"Okay, let's not let Ron feel left out.","We love you too, Ron.",Stamp the damn form.,Group hug!,"Oh, I'm down for a group hug.",Little G.,H.,Bring it in.,Come o Wow.,I think our love made him angry.,I think he broke my wrist.,I'm not kidding.,Really?,"Good morning, Ann Perkins.",How are you feeling today?,Perfect.,Except that I'm a whale and that my feet already kill.,Whales don't have feet.,I am a crazy shape.,"This morning when I got out of bed, I just tipped forward like a poorly made bowling pin.",Did I mention that my feet kill me all the time?,Oh!,Let me rub them.,"Oh, wait.",No.,I read something on raddadsolutions.,net that there's a pressure point in the foot that could induce labor.,"Oh, it doesn't matter.",I don't care.,I'm gonna go choke down those horse pills I have to take every day.,"Oh, no, no, I'll cut them in half for you.",And I will pour you a glass of flaxseed milk to wash it down.,Everything is amazing.,"Today is perfect, and I love you.",Chris is so wonderful and thoughtful and positive.,He's driving me up the  wall.,Smoothie's ready!,Opening this farmers market was one of my greatest achievements as city councilor.,"It's good for the economy, it's good for families, and it's good for promoting a healthy lifestyle, which Pawnee desperately needs.",Look at this tiny tree.,Can you eat this?,Aww.,This one's dead.,"Hey, Connie Cabbage.",What's good today?,Green cabbage is always a safe bet.,Red cabbage is good.,"I mean, you can't go wrong.",That's the fun thing about cabbage.,One of the fun things.,Oh!,"Time to crank this market up a notch, y'all!","""Chardbodies: Get a chard on""?","Let's get ""recharded"" in here!",What the hell is going on?,"Oh, yeah.",That's the new chard stand.,I suppose that's one way to sell vegetables.,"We got Swiss chard, we got white chard, we got chard poppers!",And for all you freaky vegans out there We got chard shots!,Yeah!,"Mmm, chard is so bitter.","Ben, do something.",What do you want me to do?,"Well, you're the city manager.",Kick them out.,They're violating every single one of the farmers market's rules of conduct.,"By ""rules of conduct,"" do you mean that wooden sign you made that says, ""Peas be kind to others""?","Yes, and ""In case of fire, romaine calm,"" and ""You won't bay leaf how nice olive our vendors are.",""" I don't like vegetables, but I'm very good at vegetable puns.","Okay, I admit this is a little iffy, but  A little iffy?",I can't do anything until I check the rules for city vendors.,Cabbage!,Come andget it.,"Connie, no.",Put those away.,"April's sitting on my lap   I shouldn't tell her that I gotta take a crap   oh, no  Don't.","I should just go Oh, my God.",You play guitar?,"No, that's a super small piano.","Okay, I'm gonna need the sarcasm to take a long walk right now.","My terrible nephew Sebastian is having his sixth birthday party this weekend, and the clown they hired has shingles.",You think your band

tyrant, so don't ruin this day for him!","Split that four ways, boom.",$600.00 ,I'll say it again: The men's room needs a separate dispenser for face wash.,I can't wash my face with hand soap.,Look at these pores.,They're gaping.,"Hey, guys.",Timeout.,Let's take a brief recess.,"Can we help you, Ann?","I was looking for Leslie, but now I'm curious why you guys are sitting around doing nothing and getting drunk at work.","It's the whine & cheese club, gorgeous.",It's a monthly gathering where we all get together and vent about what annoys us at work.,"Over fine wines and cheeses, of course.","Larry, salami!",The human resources department requires that I be available once a month to discuss workplace disputes with my employees.,The rules do not specify whether or not I'm allowed to listen to Willie Nelson on my headphones.,And Kyle parked his car in my spot again.,"Now, that is the fourth time this month.","Hello, walls   Hello   Hello  how'd things go for you today?",I just want to choke him until he passes out.,Time.,This looks like fun.,I want to try.,"Mm, there's rules to this, sweet pea.",It's Donna's turn next.,I'll cede my time to Ann.,I have a feeling this is gonna be good.,"Okay, well, I'm not gonna talk for long, 'cause I have to pee again, 'cause I have to pee every six minutes, 'cause I have a beach ball in my stomach that's punching on my bladder.",That sucks.,I know.,And I'm never not hungry.,"Oh, well, have some cheese.","I can't have cheese, Larry!",And I can't have wine either.,I can't have anything good.,"You know, what I can have is liquefied flaxseed.",But I don't want that.,You know what I want?,Pork rinds.,I want jelly beans.,And I want a huge trash bag filled with mashed potatoes.,"I want to be PacMan, and instead of dots, I want 'em to be cinnamon buns.","I want to be a giant head and a mouth, and I just want to eat rows and rows of junk food pellets, and where's my trash bag of potatoes?",Time.,Yikes.,"Okay, Harrison Ford movie night.","Before we do that, I was thinking more about that chard guy.","I mean, it would be very easy for you to revoke their license.","Okay, Leslie, this is city business, and I'm not an emperor.",I can't just kick them out for no reason.,The reason is it's vegetable porn.,Porn on the cob.,I'm sorry.,I'm just very good at that.,"Look, I am not a prude, but the point is, people shouldn't be half naked, you know, in public, in the middle of the day, in front of children.",There's your reason.,Kick them out.,"Look, now that we're working together again, maybe it would be good to keep our home life and our work life separate.","Like we only talk about work stuff when we're at city hall, like a firewall system.",Yeah.,"Yeah, okay.",That's smart.,"Home is home, and work is work.",We can always talk about this tomorrow at the office.,Good.,Glad you agree.,All right.,Crystal Skull it is.,"No, it's ridiculous to think that you could survive a nuclear blast by jumping into a refrigerator.","Mmhmm, yeah, uhhuh.","But still, it's like Okay, so I found a legal precedent to shut down those vegetable smut peddlers.",What is happening?,"Firewall, man.","We pulled into the parking lot, and this is technically city hall property, so now we're at work let's do this.","The farmers market is a community meeting place, and that pansexual stripper show basically negates the whole purpose.","So if you're looking for a reason to kick them out, here's 158.",The new farmers market rule book.,"Okay, when did you make this?",I stayed up all night.,I also made these Leslie's toffee surprise.,The surprise is there's toffee in the inside.,You can eat those once you revoke the chard vendor's license.,"Good day, colleague.",Okay.,Ann Perkins!,How are you feeling?,You don't want to know.,It's all I want to know.,"All right, man, you asked for it.",I have shooting pains that go all the way up from my butt to my neck.,My stomach has so many stretch marks on it that it looks like an oldfashioned globe.,My boobs are getting really sore.,"Also, I just read Brooke Shields' book on postpartum depression.",Now I have prepostpartum depression anxiety.,"Well, never fear.",I will get you Tylenol for your pain and shea butter for your belly.,And your voluptuous figure only means your body is working exactly as nature intended it.,"There, it's all good.",Is that better?,Yeah.,Thanks.,I've been reading up on nipples.,"The reason that you're feeling nipple sensitivity is because your milk ducts in your nipples are opening up, which is why I bought you this nipple kit.",It's from Kernsten's the nipple people.,"It has nipple cream, nipple pads, and also a special nipple pimple ointment in case you develop any pimples on your nipples.","Oh, my God, you have to stop using the word ""nipple.",""" Okay.",Anyway.,Hopefully that will help you with any sensitivity that may arise around your boob hats.,"Larry, get in there!",Come on!,What doI don't even know what we're doing.,"What is the meaning of this, nurse?",Emergency whine & cheese club.,"Put your headphones on, Ron.",I have a lot of complaints.,Sit down.,I need to vent.,And do not under any circumstances respond to anything I say.,All right.,"Let's talk about vomit, kids.",I do it all day long.,"Super fun  it feels super good  I wanna do it all the time  sex is cool Okay, Sex Is Cool.",Got that.,I say we finish on Drunk Off Our Asses.,And I think we should do Sex in Space.,"It's 20 minutes long, but it's really good.","Babe, I don't think you should play any of those songs for a group of sixyearolds.","Whoa, wait sixyearolds?",Did you book us a gig at a kids' party?,You said we were playing at a festival.,You said Dave Grohl might be there.,Dave Grohl might be there.,I don't know.,He might be anywhere.,"The guy's awesome, and he's unpredictable.","No, no, I'm not playing for a bunch of screaming kids.",Mouse Rat is a rock band.,We're not the Wiggles.,Come on!,I'm sick of all the drama with this band.,II quit.,I'm going back to rabbinical school.,Umbilical school?,"Rivers, come back.","Rivers, don't do this.",Hey!,Shaq might be there!,"Hey, did you get a chance to sign off on that booklet I gave you?","Well, I read it, but it seems like your farmers market rules may be specifically targeting chardbodies.",What?,How?,"""No visible cleavage.","""No strobe lights.",No chardrelated innuendo.,""" Those apply to all vendors.","Either way, it's too late.",The train has left the station.,"Okay, what train, from which station?",You're revoking my license?,"Oh, boy.","Yes, Nolan, under the auspices of the office of city manager, et cetera, et cetera, it's not important, you are in violation of many rules, and therefore you cannot sell your goods anymore at the Pawnee farmers market.","Ben, back me up on this without hesitation.","Nolan, can I have a second to speak with my w with Ms.",Knope for a second?,"Look, chard is disgusting.",You try selling it without sexy dancers.,It's impossible.,"It's like, ""Hey, you like lettuce?","""Try this.",It's worse.,It tastes like kale took a dump on spinach.,""" I like to think of it as celery with B.",O.,"But if it's so gross, you should just sell something else.",I inherited this farm from my dad.,It's all I have.,"Plus, the other vendors want me there.",I'm good for business.,We're not revoking your license.,For now.,I am sorry you had to come in.,Judas!,"I don't appreciate being ambushed, Leslie.",Let's just go home.,No.,I know what you're trying to do.,"If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore.","Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.",M.,", and we will solve this chard issue once and for all.",Don't forget your approval pen.,What?,There's no such thing.,"Yes, there is.",I made it for you last night.,"Ugh, and Lamaze class, wait till I tell you about that Ponzi scheme.",Ugh.,"Oh, hey, Donna, what the hell?",You know I can't be around smoke or fatty tuna.,"Ron At first, this was funny, but it's gotten out of hand.","This was our chance to vent about work, and you've taken it over.",Yeah!,It's sushi and cigar club now.,Wow.,Okay.,I see how it is.,I feel bad.,I don't.,This is a Cuban.,This is yellowtail.,I feel amazing.,Whoa!,Monster in the window!,You know what my biggest complaint is?,"I have a million things I need to complain about, and I can't take them home because Chris is the most considerate person in the world, and he just wants to help me, and then I feel bad about that, and then I get annoyed that he wants to help me, and I feel even worse about that!","I thought you guys would be cool with me complaining 'cause it's all you do, is sit here and complain without judgment or guilt.",But you know what?,I guess I was wrong.,And you know what?,"I would yell some more, but I think I just peed my pants a little bit.",What's happening now?,Is the nurse upset?,I don't care.,"Okay, 6:00.",Let's do this.,Larry?,Mm.,"Hey, Leslie.","Ben couldn't make it, so he asked me to read you this.","""Dear honey"" Oh, how sweet.",Read.,Oh.,"""Sorry, but I think we just need to take a break ""from this work issue.","""Please don't grind your teeth too hard ""when you hear this.",I will see you in the car.,I love you.,""" Oh, that is so sweet that you still write love letters to What the hell are you doing out here?","Sorry, babe.",I am off city hall property.,You have to stop.,Firewall.,Wrong.,"All roads and bridges fall under the purview of the Pawnee department of transportation, which is located on the fourth floor of city hall.",Firewall down.,"Stay frosty, Wyatt.",We're just getting started.,"Okay, well, that's interesting.",You know why?,Why?,Because Mother Haha!,Bank!,Private property.,Firewall restored!,Hahaha!,The concrete that you're standing on was poured by a

friends.",I'm just about to go on my night jog.,Would you like to join me?,"Mm, hard pass.",We're here because you need to tend to your woman.,"She's complaining about everything, ruining whine & cheese club.",I literally have Why is Ron wearing headphones?,What's whine & cheese club?,And what is Ann complaining about?,"You, mostly how you never let her vent because you're always too busy trying to solve everything for her.",She's upset that I'm trying to help her?,"You've fallen into a classic trap, Christopher trying to fix a woman's problems instead of just listening to what they are!",Why are you yelling?,Tom put all my records into this rectangle!,"Hey, man, if Ann needs Tylenol, she can get it herself.","What she needs from you is to just look her in the eyes, nod your head, and say those two magic words.","""That sucks.",""" ""That sucks""?",I spent my entire life reading instructional books about relationships in order to trick women into liking me.,"When Ann tells you what's bothering her, don't try to fix it.","Just say, ""Damn, that sucks.",""" The songs just play one right after the other!",This is an excellent rectangle!,"Okay, this is insane.","It is 40 degrees, and we are standing in freezing water.","No, this is our motivation.",We are not leaving this fountain until we've figured this out once and for all.,Fine.,Why are you not supporting me on this?,I thought you agreed with me.,"I do, as a person, but as city manager, I'm not 100% sure you have a case.",You're not listening to my side.,"I mean, sometimes when we disagree, you're so passionate, I feel like I'm arguing with the sun.",What?,That is totally crazy!,I am super chill all the time!," Look, let's just admit it.", We're in a weird position.,

Oh, crap."," Now what the hell am I supposed to sing? It's time, Andrew."," These kids are tearing my house apart, and I need you to calm them with the power of song."," Oh, gosh, here's the thing-- I can't do it.", I got laryngitis.," You will not bail on me, Andrew Dwyer.", You will perform.," My nephew is something of an outcast in his school, and I got Erica Swarvane to come, which is a huge get.", She rules the first grade.," And this party will determine his social status for the next hundred years!

thought indoor fireworks would be cool then guess what, you're gonna give me indoor fireworks.",Tonight's biggest surprise is 5 years in the making.,It all goes back to when I first met my best friend.,I'm here to talk about the abandoned lot on Sullivan Street.,"I've been trying to get this thing fixed for months, and it's governmentowned and you need to do something about it.",I will help you.,Is that a promise?,It's more than a promise.,It's a pinky promise.,That promise launched a friendship so grand it takes 103 scrapbooks to capture it.,"I have secretly arranged to officially break ground on Pawnee commons at midnight, fulfilling my pinky promise that I made five years ago.","Oh, ice cream sandwich taste test!",That was our biggest fight.,"Hey, Knope.",Harold.,You're breaking ground on the Pawnee commons tonight?,Public works never signed off on that.,"Look, your office was giving me a hard time, so I had to call in a few favors.",I don't like it when people go over my head.,Understood.,I will make a note of that.,Would you like a treat?,"I run that department and I do not appreciate  Damn, that's really good.",Right?,There's gonna be a lot of these at the party.,You should come by.,I kno I get it.,I know what you're doing.,And I stillis there a little crunch in there?,Hazelnut.,Ooh.,"Ooh, right?",See you tonight.,"Okay, well, let's go set up this party.","April, thank you.","I know you may tease Ann, but deep down inside I can tell that you really care.",Ann's leaving town and saying painful goodbyes to loved ones.,Greatest day of my life!,Thank you all so much for helping me with these boxes.,"I'm just a little behind because every time I start, I get a little emotional.","Hey, that box has my name on it.","Hey, this one has my name on it.",This one has plates' name on it.,You have just found your buddy boxes.,Each box contains a memento of our friendship.,"I was gonna give them to you later, but there is no time like the present.",Fun pun alert.,A bronzed hamburger.,"It's from our turkey versus beef cookoff, remember?",You were a worthy adversary.,"I would have preferred a regular hamburger for eating, but this is very nice.",spreadsheets?,"Man, that year was insane!",That was the year you went from being an auditor to a legend.,Whoa!,A picture of me officiating Leslie and Ben's wedding.,"And look, you can just about see my head.",Thank you so much.,Snakejuice!,I thought these were destroyed by the FDA.,"I did have to go to a very seedy location to find it, but now I know where to go to place a bet on horse fighting.","Okay, don't mention anything about the groundbreaking to Ann.",Repeat that back to me.,"Tell Ann about the groundbreaking, frame Ann for murder, release a deadly virus into the water supply.",Good.,Oh!,"Bon voyage, Ann.","My God, this is amazing.",That's sparkling cider.,Why is there a New Year's Eve countdown clock and the Easter bunny?,"I don't know when we're gonna be able to visit each other, so just to be safe this party is a celebration of every event that's gonna happen this year.","Your birthday, New Year's, Chinese New Year's, flag day.",Ain't no party like a Leslie Knope party 'cause a Leslie Knope party is actually 30 parties.,"Knope, you have outknoped yourself.",Seems like the party's dying down.,Weird.,"Ann, you probably wanna head to Michigan forever, so I snuck into your house and packed a bag for you.",Bye.,This is just a bunch of bras and knives.,And loose onions.,"Okay, party!",Don't drink!,Have fun!,"Hey, so we have a little farewell gift for you.","We all pitched in and got you a gift card from that home store, ""Pots and Pans.",""" We have been on the prowl for some amazing pots.","Well, that card's for three pans.","Either way, this is great.",You know what?,"We should get to the goodbye party, although I know it's mostly for Ann.","Yeah, but there's, like, one corner for you and it's just carob cookies and berries.",Carob cookies and berries are literally my favorite dessert alternative.,I'll go get changed.,"Man, he put a lot of work into our presents.",I feel kinda bad just getting him a gift card.,I also shook his hand.,Twice.,Anything more than that would be excessive.,Let's all put our heads together and brainstorm.,We gotta send this dude off with the perfect gift.,"I say we start with the three ""Cs,"" cashmere, concert tickets, caboodles of cash.",I feel like those are perfect gifts for you.,Those are perfect gifts for anyone.,"Ugh, I wish you guys were Donna!",I'm 100% sure that I will not meet another Donna Meagle in Michigan.,I'm gonna miss you.,"You know, I'm gonna miss you too, Perkins.","But now that you're officially out of the dating pool, you know I'm gonna run this town, right?",Ooh.,"Oh, yeah, you do not wanna go down that road.","Trust me, I tried.","Hi, Stephen.","Hey, Ann.",Super cute baby bump.,Thanks.,Good looking out.,"Hey, Ron, have you seen April?",I've been mostly focused on these ribs.,"By the way, you're out of Easter ham and Thanksgiving turkey.",Great party.,Hey.,Are you on the lot?,Is everything okay?,"Uh, not really.","Public works put up a giant padlock on the fence and a sign that says ""No trespassing.",""" That probably doesn't apply to us.","There's also a sign that says ""Especially Leslie Knope.",""" Well, Leslie Knope is a very common name.",There's a professor in Copenhagen named Leslie Knope.,They probably mean him.,Do they mean the professor?,"Yeah, there's a picture of you also.",And two huge security guards.,Holy mother of Malia!,And Sasha.,I love them both equally.,"Okay, it's that stupid Harold who's behind this.",Get here and we will make a plan.,How long do I have to do this?,"Until I say so, Orin!",Stay in character.,Leslie can't watch anything with Julie Andrews in it before bedtime because it gets her too hyper.,Okay.,"If Chris gets cranky around noon, just stuff some chia seeds into a fig works every time.","Awesome, thank you.","Wow, we really picked some intense people  to spend our lives with, huh?",Yeah.,Where's Leslie?,I haven't seen her in a while.,"Oh, she's just running around trying to pull off an elaborate, thoughtful surprise for you.",Of course.,Where's Chris?,"I told him that One Headlight By the Wallflowers isn't ""dancing"" music and he said ""Not with that attitude.",""" Of course.","Dude, Ann, you know what I just remembered?",We used to date.,"Yeah, we lived together for two years.","I know, it's crazy, right?","Anyways, you're the best.",Have fun in Mexico.,"Harold, it is Leslie Knope again.","I know you are screening my calls, but if you could call me bac And his voicemail is full.",Did you have any luck?,Flipped through the bylaws.,I don't think there's anything I can do.,What is the point of being married to a city manager if he can't wield unfettered power to crush my enemies?,Hopefully there are a few other reasons.,Yeah.,Looks like we hit a wall.,"Oh, God.",April?,Are you okay?,What's happening?,I'm just so scared that this means that Ann won't really leave.,"Life, huh?",It's quite a ride.,"Yes, Tom, it is.",I got you a goingaway present.,I'm deleting you from my phone.,You're finally free of my animal magnetism.,"Maybe one day years from now when we're both old and Chris is dead, you'll run into me somewhere.",I'll be opening my latest mega club.,"I'll see you there on the street by yourself and I'll tell the bouncer/my bodyguard, ""Hey, that woman's way too old to get into this club, but why don't you let her in the back?",""" That's very generous.","Stay golden, sweetheart.","I'm gonna miss you too, Tom.",Shh.,And you're kind and you're thoughtful and you're always such a delight to have around.,I am sure you are going to be an incredible mother.,"Thanks, Larry.",That's nice.,"Goodbye, Ann.",I have enjoyed parts of our time together.,"Oh, God, Ron.",That was really something.,"Okay, what do we have for Chris?",I got this City of Pawnee mug.,"Also, this cool jacket.","No, I think that's Chris's jacket.","Okay, good, then we know he likes it.","Catch up, Larry.","Okay, I found some old receipts from lunches we had together.",Is that anything?,This is my contribution.,"It says ""Ron.",""" Hey, guys, what's going on?","Oh, we're just giving you a bunch of cool gifts.","No, GodohGod.","Get your hopes up, Chris.",Let's see what's in here.,Some assorted items.,Andsome pieces of paper.,"Boom, nailed it.",All right.,Now we can start enjoying this party.,"Leslie, this is the most incredible event that has ever been thrown.",There is a pilgrim line dancing with a box of candies.,Why do you look so bummed out?,We were planning a surprise groundbreaking at Pawnee commons for you.,"You know, an actual beginning to the project that brought us together.",But now we can't do it because Harold is such a jerk face.,He put a barbed wire fence around the lot and now it's not happening.,"I'm sorry, Ann.","First of all, don't apologize.","And second of all, screw Harold.","If I learned one thing from Leslie Knope it is we do not take ""No"" for an answer.",Anything is possible if we work hard enough.,Let's do it.,"Oh, my God!",Ann Perkins to the rescue.,"Okay, hands in, everybody.","One, two, three.",Groundbreaking!,Let's go!,"Dark forces, arise!","Okay, I didn't plan what we were all gonna say.",That's my bad.,"Here we go, Ann.",Let's go.,"Okay, knock or ring the bell?",Bust in unannounced.,Love it!,Harold.,"What the hell, Knope?",We need the key to the fence that you put up on the Sullivan Street lot.,You snuck around behind my back.,I told you I didn't like that.,Forget it.,"Come on, Harold, look.",This is a great opportunity you have right now.,Just think of us as your genies who can give you anything you want.,Nothing gross.,"Okay, yeah, there is something I want.",Super fizzy fruity pop.,Sorry?,"Sweetums used to stock our office with free sodas as a promotional thing, but that Kathryn Pinewood lady just took 'em away.","If you can get us our free sodas back, I'll get you a key.",Deal.,Easy.,It is not easy.,Kathryn Pinewood is the person on earth who hates me the most.,"Well, luckily, you're with the person on earth who loves you the most.",Too cheesy?,"No, it's perfect.",I love you.,Don't leave.,Come on.,"Donna, you are a remarkable woman, and I just wanted to say that I've always thought of you as family.",I just wanna say that I've always thought you were hot.,"Yes, I know.","April Yeah, you saw a lot of potential in me, I'm like a daughter to you, and it was a treat to watch me blossom.","Blah blah blah, bye.",That is remarkably close to what I was going to say.,"Also, I'm proud of you.","Donna, are you grabbing my butt?",Can you blame me?,No!,"Sorry, can't help you ladies.",I don't have time for disgraced former politicians and unmarried preggos.,"Oh, Kathryn, always a delight.","Listen, I know that you and Leslie have had your disagreements in the past, but we really need the key, and we can only get the key if we get the sodas.",Please?,I don't see why I should do you any favors.,"I mean, if you were still a city councilor, maybe.",But I seem to remember you were recalled.,Is that right?,"How dare yo  Okay, Leslie.",Please.,It's not worth it.,For you.,"For me, I don't care.",What the hell?,"Yeah, Pinewood, that's right.",I'm pregnant and I have you in a headlock.,"And if you try to fight back, I will sue you.",Unless you tell us how to get those sodas right now.,"Okay, fine.",Sweetums has been desperately trying to get a local celebrity spokesman to endorse their new sports drink.,"So if you can make that happen somehow, they'll give you whatever you want.","Damn, Perkins.","Okay, who does Sweetums want as their spokesperson?",They already tried to get me to endorse that sports drink.,"I said ""No.",""" They want me dunking on the label.",When is this town gonna realize that I'm more than a former high school basketball star?,I don't think this new sports drink is even about basketball.,"It's called ""Sweetums dunktastic threepoint Bball blast"" the slogan is ""It's all about basketball.",""" I'm sorry, you're gonna have to find yourself some other famous pawneean.","We know that you were already approached by Sweetums and you said ""No,"" but is there any way you would reconsider?","I'm sorry, Miss Knope.","There is such a thing as journalistic integrity, and it is something that I have as a journalist with integrity.","It's really important, Perd.",Please?,Come on.,For old time's sake.,"Well, the story of that appeal is it was heartfelt.","And in response to that appeal, I respond: Okay.",For old time's sake?,Does that meano!,"Ann, you tricky minx.",Yep.,I went on a date with Perd.,What?,"It was during that ""explore my freedom as a single woman"" phase.",Wow.,We just had a drink.,"And at the end he said, ""I am going to kiss you now by putting my mouth on your mouth.",""" And then I ran away.",It was absolutely the right call.,"Well, we could just tell him the truth that we feel bad that we didn't get him anything nice.",Tell the truth?,That's hilarious.,No.,"We tell him we had the perfect gift, but we were robbed at gunpoint.","""Chris, he had a gun.",He took all the gifts.,""" Now Chris feels bad, he's buying us gifts.","Next thing you know, Tommy's got a new watch.","Again, I don't see the problem.",I shook the man's hand.,Twice.,"Guys, look what I got at the president's day booth.",Ask not what your country can do for you.,"From Family Guy, right?","Listen, Chris, we have to tell you something.",We feel bad because you got us such thoughtful gifts and we got you three pans and a bag of nothing.,"Guys, I don't need anything from you.","My buddy boxes are about the past, but let's focus on the future.",Because we're always gonna be friends.,And just the fact that you feel bad about your bag of nothing proves that.,To the future.,"Hear, hear.",To the future.,To the future.,Cheers.,I have an idea.,Future.,Don't you ladies ever knock?,No.,"Okay, so we got Perd Hapley to sign on with Sweetums, which means that you get your sodas back, which means that we get our key.",Okay?,Everything's here in writing.,Now call off your guards.,Okay.,Fine.,You two are a couple of real pains in the ass.,You know that?,"Harold, your tiny brain could not understand this, but that is the best compliment you could ever give the two women standing in front of you.","Bye, Harold.",Victory at last.,Whoo!,All right.,You're all set.,"Okay, I am gonna call the official ceremonial ribbon cutting guy, 'cause I think we may have missed him.",What are you doing?,It's for the raccoons.,You have to hiss really loud and stomp your feet so they'll leave you alone.,"And if one comes close, make yourself really large like a puffer fish.",Pawnee raccoons.,That is one thing I will not miss.,"Well, Michigan has wolverines.",Maybe they'll eat your toes.,So how long do you think you'll stay in Pawnee for?,I don't know.,We like it here.,"I made Andy promise that someday we'll move to Transylvania, but that probably won't happen till we're, like, 100.","Well, for what it's worth, I'm really happy that you and Andy are married.",Why?,Why?,Because I love him and I love you.,Why wouldn't I be happy?,I love you too.,What's that?,I love you too.,II couldn'tI couldn't quite hear you.,Please don't make me say it.,Please.,My goingaway present to you will be that I do not make you audibly say that you love me.,Thank you.,What's happening here?,"  Okay, Leslie's coming back."," - Get off me, wench! - Did I miss a nice moment? - No."," - Yes, you did."," Oh, good."," Guys, what are you doing here? Come in.", You caught me before my first run of the day.," I call it my ""beat the sun"" run.", It's a race between me and the sun.," Well, we got one more gift for you.", It's quarter-sawn zebra wood adjoined by floating tenons to the black walnut corner posts., Finished with a wiping varnish that's a secret Swanson family recipe.," Handmade at my woodshop, and you are correct.", It is gorgeous.," You're starting a new life with your new family, so it's an empty buddy box to fill with memories for your little buddy.", Ortwizzlers., That's the beautiful thing about a box.," We all burned our initials in, see? Wait a minute, who's G-J-L-G-G? That's Garry Jerry Larry Gergich Gengurch.", I burned in all my names., I really--I didn't know what to do.," Well, um Thank you."," Um, this tear, um, caused by the overwhelming thoughtfulness of my friends will be my baby's first memory.", Salt water will warp the wood., So keep your tears in your eyes where they belong.," Will do, Ron Swanson.", Can I still call you when I have thoughts on Jennifer Aniston's future? Not if I call you first., And can we still be on the phone for every state of the Union address and every Oscar red carpet coverage and every single viewing of Tootsie? Of course.," Oh, Ann Perkins.", You perfect sunflower.," You totally changed me, you know? You taught me how to balance my life, - how to be patient.", - Mm - How to be more patient.," - Yeah, that's better.", How to throw bureaucratic caution to the wind when it came to Ben.," But most importantly, you taught me that I can't pull off a tulip skirt.", It's just not your shape.," Well, I don't think this ceremonial ribbon cutting guy is gonna make it.", Either he flaked or he tripped and impaled himself on his own giant scissors., We wait for no man., Let's do this.," One, two, three! All right, I got my park.", That's all I wanted from you., Friendship over.," Don't even joke about that, Ann.", It was your idea to get me that box.," Ah, it was a group effort.", But it had that trademark Ben Wyatt mix of thoughtful and resourceful., You are literally the best friend that I will ever have.," You too, man.", Leslie Knope., Chris Traeger., I just wanna say that getting to know you and watching you work has been one of the greatest experiences of my life--that and working with Dr., Richard Nygard.," Sure, and I just want you to know that I thought there was no man on earth good enough for Ann Perkins.", - And I still think that., - Right.," But if there is no one actually good enough for her, you are pretty damn close."," Okay, well, this is normal.", No big deal., - Drive safe., - We will., I packed you some sandwiches and some caffeine free iced tea.," So--oh, and there's a mix CD that I made already loaded in your car."," There's a lot of Sarah McLanahan, so, Chris, I apologize.", Things are gonna get emotional., I love you., I love you too.," Breakfast, Knope? Oh, I don't know.", Come on., There has never been a sadness that can't be cured by breakfast food., That's fair., Someone else is gonna have to drive though., My eyes are basically useless right now., I'm on it., Shotgun! I called shotgun! - You're all nailed., - I call sitting on your lap., You can't--I--double shotgun! We call double shotgun! How come people don't do that more often? It's illegal., Raise you hand if you want waffles., I'm eating waffles.," Bacon and eggs, please and thank you.",  You belong somewhere you feel free    ,"

now.,Our guest is former city councilwoman Leslie Knope.,"Leslie, thought  For your thoughts.",I said it.,"Absorb the aggression, Derry.",Absorb the aggression.,"Well, I just want to say thank you so much for having me.",It's a thrill to be here.,"As a listener, I think the merging of your two shows has really created such a big, quiet, arcane ball of fun.",It's been a couple of months since Pawnee and Eagleton officially merged.,Things are going okay.,There's still a little animosity between the two towns.,I haven't seen Pawneeans this mad since Frankie's discontinued their pizzastuffedcrust pizza.,It was a pizza whose crust was stuffed with little pizzas.,And the crust of those little pizzas was made of chocolate.,Ms.,"Knope, I understand you're here today to try to convince us that this disastrous merger of our two towns was, in any way, a good idea.","Yes, there were some bumps and bruises.",And a brief rash of arson.,And a rather largescale brawl at the dump.,"But overall, the state of the merger is very strong.",Scoff.,"Did you just say the word ""scoff""?","You must admit, Ms.","Knope, that the merging of the towns has been fraught with antipathy.","For example, I now have to share my studio with a fatuous twerp who shall remain nameless.",This twerp has a name.,And it's August N'gutu LiebowitzClementine.,Guys Hello.,Thank you so much for letting me help plan your anniversary.,It is so wonderful to be part of such a special day.,"Okay, remember, under no circumstances can Leslie know about what's going on.","She has to make that face, do you understand?","No, I don't fully, but my lips are sealed.","I asked for Larry's help because he has the most successful marriage of anyone I know, to a gorgeous woman.","Which, honestly, is still a mystery to me.","Like, was it a hypnosis accident or something, where they put Gayle under and made her fall in love with Larry and never said the magic word to snap her out of it?","Like, if I say ""nutmeg,"" will she wake up and start screaming?",What kind of pet are you interested in adopting?,"We have dogs, cats, rabbits.","Um, I work here, so, legally, you can adopt me.",The girls want an actual dog.,And they want it to look like this.,Interesting.,"So, like a banana made of spiders?","I've said it before and I'll say it again, children are terrible artists.",And artists are crooks.,I think I know a good dog.,There he is!,"Ron, how about this guy?","Yes, he is a handsome fellow.","Hello, dog.",I'll take him.,That was easy.,Awesome.,"Well, Donna can help you get started on the paperwork.",Donna?,"""Why lie?",I'm shopping.,Back in an hour.,""" Ugh!","God, she's always just leaving and not telling me.","Hello, caller.",You have a comment?,"Yeah, ever since the merger, we've had a really bad trash problem.","Well, yes, there has been some confusion with some of the garbage routes.",And the Sanitation Department is stretched a little thin.,"No, I mean Eagletonians are human garbage.",And we should throw them in a dumpster.,Kapow!,"Yeah, I really like the merger, but I hate that Eagleton was forced to join Pawnee.","Well, that's what the merger is.",Oh.,"Yeah, then I hate the merger.",I think the merger was great.,And I think Leslie Knope did an amazing job.,"I don't know who this is, but I agree.",It's Andy!,Hey.,I'm on the radio!,That's all the time we have on Thought For Your Thoughts.,I'm Derry Murbles.,And I'm August Clementine.,And I talked last.,Good day.,Is this land mine still functional?,Partially.,Why?,Because I want to blow up Donna's desk so I can teach her a lesson about what happens when you skip work.,I'm not sure that's how you should go about this.,"I'm kind of her boss, now, but I still feel weird disciplining her.",What do I do?,Look her in the eyes and tell her exactly what you need from her.,"Be mature, direct, and firm.",What?,Some fool just slammed me on Yelp.,I took Ron's advice.,I very maturely and straightforwardly left anonymous comments about Donna online.,"""Stopped by to adopt a dog, ""but the employee, Donna Meagle, ""was nowhere to be found.","Thanks for nothing, Donna Meagle.",Booooo!,""" With five ""O""s.","Oh, my God, that sucks.","Just have to work harder, I guess, huh?",This freak thinks he can hide behind some anonymous user name?,I'm about to hunt you down.,"Don't be upset, Leslie.",No one listens to the radio.,I wasn't even listening.,I was listening to podcasts.,Podcasts are great.,Radio is boring.,"Tom, this merger needs a win something symbolic and bright and happy that will show that there's light at the end of the tunnel.","God, I am so stressed.","Uh, Leslie, may I borrow you for a second?",Something very special to show you.,"Now is not the time, Larry.",Please leave.,I think you  Larry!,What are you still doing here?,"Aw, jeez.",Okay.,I just wish Pawnee and Eagleton were as happy as Ben and me.,"Yeah, by the way, I was gonna mention, you look really old in this picture.",What?,"Andy, this is a picture of us.",This is a picture of an elderly couple.,Rosie and Doug DeMarco.,They've been married for 50 years.,"""Rosie Hails from Pawnee, while Doug is originally from the former Eagleton.",""" Oh, my God, this is perfect.",A PawneeEagleton couple that has been married for 50 years is a perfect symbol of how our towns can get along.,And we are gonna hold them up as an example of PawneeEagleton unity.,Whoo!,I'm getting the epiphany sweats.,Stop where you are and take off your clothes.,It's couples massage.,Ugh.,Where's Leslie?,"Oh, well, she seemed kind of stressed out.","And then she yelled at me, and she said she was too busy to come.","And since you had said do not tell her the secret  under any circumstances  Aw, man.","Well, that's a danger of doing things a day early, I guess.",Should I text her and try again?,"Why don't you just go ahead and get your massage, and then hopefully we can get her in for the next thing.",Okay.,I have been kind of tense lately.,Just thinking about the new Star Wars sequel.,I'm afraid they're gonna rely too heavily on CGI.,And I'm carrying it all in my shoulders.,Just you?,You paid for a couple.,"Well, can't believe I'm saying this, but, uh Larry, would you like to get a couples massage with me?",I would love to.,Are we sure we should do this?,"Last time we scared an old person, Larry had a heart attack.",That was awesome.,He farted so much.,"Okay, look, obviously, we don't really know these people, so let's keep things fun and positive and celebratory, and mergery.",Can I help you?,"Hello, Mrs.","DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day.",All right.,How much money did we win?,"Oh, no, you didn't win any money, you won something better than money.",A golden anniversary celebration.,So no money.,"No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check it.",Told you.,"Yes, you did, Tom.",Thank you.,Now is not the time.,We Hey!,Hey!,We'll give you some money.,Okay?,"Here, here's some money.",Everybody give 'em money.,"I got football cards, and a travel mouthwash.",Wow!,That's great!,Let's get started!,Just give me the IP address of the dude that gave me that crackedout Yelp review.,"Okay, here we go.",The IP address says it came from someone inside city hall.,In this building?,"Oh, hell, no.","Well, who cares, really?",It's just some dumb internet person.,Ignore it.,Ignore it?,I'm about to come down on this dude like Thor's hammer Mjolnir.,I'm about to go Mjolnir on his ass!,"Speaking of bad reviews Computers are mostly pointless, but that Yelp thing gave me a great idea on how to criticize people and places.","I am composing stronglyworded letters about things I disapprove of, and I am using the internet to get addresses where I can send them.","So far I've written to a vegetable farm, several European ambassadors, a manufacturer of male cologne, and a nonfat frozen yogurt bar.","""Dear frozen yogurt, you are the celery of desserts.",Be ice cream or be nothing.,Zero stars.,""" Oh, I cannot wait for Leslie to see this surprise.",I am so prepared.,I watched Enchanted three times to get all the details right.,"And then another two times, because that movie is amazing.","Oh, it really is.",Hello?,"Oh, hey, Leslie.",You want to go grab lunch together?,I'm out front.,Super casual.,"I'm sorry, babe.",I'm not even in my office.,I'm out saving the merger.,Can it wait?,"Oh, yeah.","Yeah, yeah, yeah.",No worries.,"Okay, great.",I'll see you at dinner.,I love you.,"Oh, boy.","Well, it's not too late to cancel the waffle buffet or the Hilary impersonator, but a lot of these deposits were nonrefundable.","Hey, Larry.",You up for a boys' day out in a horsedrawn carriage?,Sure.,What the heck?,"Well, thus begins our enchanted adventure.","God, that movie really was amazing.",And you know what doesn't get enough credit in that movie?,The score.,Music.,"Good sir, tally ho.","God, that from the movie!",That is definitely from the movie.,"Okay, you two, head on up there.",We are gonna recreate your wedding photo from 50 years ago.,"Okay, let's relive that day.",Only this time could we shave her moustache?,"Oh, boy.",I don't know.,I'm kind of worried about putting these two on live TV.,They're sort of grumpy.,Why are we wasting our time with these old people anyway?,They're like the old version of iTunes.,"We're like the new version of iTunes, baby.",We're gonna be here forever.,"Oh, my God.",I'm gonna die someday.,"Well, let's just hope that deep down these two still love each other.","Hey, no touching.",This is not your birthday.,"Now, you see, the trick with paella is to use just enough saffron  to complement the shellfish.",Okay.,"Oh, man, that is so good.","Oh, yeah.","Wow, isn't this exciting?","In just a few minutes, you are going to be professing your love on television.",Could I have a glass of water before we go on?,Don't give him any water.,"He does this annoying thing where every time he takes a drink of water he goes, ""Ah"" She does this annoying thing where every time she takes a drink of water she is an old nag.","Ah, the playful banter of a couple on the same team.","That's what this is, right?","All right, let's burn this candle.","Joan, if we could just have a moment.",We need to get ready.,"Oh, no, no.",We gotta go.,"Yeah, the uppers are kicking in.","Just took some ludes to kind of smooth it out, so I'm right in that sweet spot.","Got about 20 minutes before I either get really tired or really horny, so let's roll.","Dougie, are you sure you want to go on television?",You look like a leather glove got caught in a lawnmower.,"Okay, you know what?",I'm going to admit something.,"I orchestrated the PawneeEagleton merger, and I was hoping that your marriage could show people that a happy union is possible.","So when you're out there, if you could just, you know, look back over the past and focus on the good times, okay?","Donna, you wanted to see me?","Yes, I did, troll.",What?,"You tried to adopt a cat last week and I turned you down, because I thought it was too sad for you to have six cats.",Then you tried to blow up my spot online.,You're fired.,"You're not my boss, I work for the city attorney's office.",You're fired.,How much postage does it take to send a letter to Canada?,Who's it going to?,Canada.,"It says, ""Dear Canada, you.",""" Doug and Rosie DeMarco, Ahh.",Tell us how you first met.,"Well, it was 1963, and we met, and it was great.",Isn't love grand?,to bridge the meaningless divide between Pawnee and Eagleton.,"Yeah, my show, my questions.",So what is the secret sauce that we should all be putting on our marriage burgers?,"Well, we never go to bed angry.","Never, ever would have thought of that.",Ahh.,Okay.,I can't do this.,"Leslie, you can keep your money.",Mmoney?,Did you bribe them to be here?,"No, I Leslie offered us each  Ah  But it's impossible.",You want to know why we got married?,Bring it.,"I had no prospects, and Dougie here had an alcohol problem.","Plus the Cold War was happening, and frankly, we all thought we were gonna die.","Well, I figured I could really tick off my parents by shacking up with some Pawnee trash.",Yatatatata.,Okay.,"We all agree that marriages have their ups and downs, but at the end of the day, they're worth it because Who likes tap dancing?",I slept with Sharon in 1979.,I used to get out of the shower in front of your brother on purpose.,"Hey, Leslie, who cares?",They're old people.,"They eat, they sleep, they complain, and they watch Family Feud.","Oh, my God, I wanna be an old person.","Gah, I don't know what to do.",I wish Ben was here.,What is he doing right now?,"Oh, man!",You did good!,Larry!,Whoa!,Wow.,Thank you.,Can I help you?,"Yeah, I own Lettuce Eat, the vegan restaurant on Lowell Drive, and I wanted to know why you nailed this letter to my door.","""Veganism is the sad result ""of a morally corrupt mind.",Reconsider your life.,""" Because I believe it.",Good day.,Carnivores.,You're all the same.,How did that guy know where to find you?,I assume he saw my name and address at the bottom of the letter I nailed to his door.,You signed your real name?,Of course I did.,What's gonna happen?,A vegan is gonna physically attack me?,They're basically made of glass.,"But more importantly, if you believe in something, you sign your name to it.",Which is why the makers of carbonated water will soon know exactly where to find me.,"Donna, Kyle did not write those things, okay?",I did.,I know.,You do?,I checked what else that user had written.,"It was a review of a funeral home that said ""Great first date spot.",""" I dragged Kyle in here to see if you would come clean.","Well, you overestimated how much I care what happens to Kyle.","Or anyone, really.",But I'm sorry that I didn't just talk to you.,And I'm sorry I bailed on work.,And I'm sorry I toyed with you instead of coming at you straight.,"From now on, we say what we feel.",Cool?,Cool.,Your lipstick looks weird.,You're gonna want to shut your mouth right now.,Good talk.,I don't know.,Maybe Pawneeans and Eagletonians aren't meant to coexist.,"Well, at least our merger is going well.",Cheers.,Cheers.,"You know, Andy and Tom were right when they said the DeMarcos don't matter.",Their generation's the past.,The way to make this merger take hold is to focus on the future., Of course., The children., The children are our future.," Whitney Houston knew it, and so do you, and so do I.", I'm gonna need your help on something., - I think we should go to work - Oh., But not now., We're having dinner.," Damn, this paella is good.", Did you put saffron in here? It makes the shellfish taste delicious., Yes.," Yes, it does."," Okay, the people in this room are the first members of the Pawnee-Eagleton Youth Committee."," Now, April says that young people think the word ""committee"" is lame, so let's just think of this as a like a super chill, fun e-hangout.", Worse., That's worse.," Okay, new people.", Let's introduce ourselves., Craig Middlebrooks.," Samantha in the boardroom, Miranda in the bedroom."," I know it's not ideal, but it's who I am.", This is my friend Madison., She's amazing., And she drove me here! Okay., This group has an incredibly important job., You need to figure out how to hold this town together.," You are going to meet twice a week and you're here because of your energy, and your youth, and for some of you, your mental age, and you're going to find a way to make this merger stick.", So we are gonna order you some 'zzas., You get to B.,S.,#NAME?, Just chill., Peace out.," Okay, so it's been an hour."," From out there, it looks like you guys were having some fun, getting to know each other.", So why don't we call this first meeting a success and then we'll get together later in the week.," Hold up, sweet pea.", We have an idea., It's called the Unity Concert., It's a massive music and arts festival to celebrate the merger., We get artists and musicians from both towns to come together.," It's gonna be like a giant Woodstock, except for instead of everybody rolling around in mud, they'll be rolling around in happiness.", Or maybe mud., I don't know., I can't control the weather., We want to have a bunch of different band stages.," You know, people will go to parts of the town they don't usually go to."," Plus, we'll have tents for art exhibits and panels, and maybe a short film festival.", Donna said she might be able to get Ginuwine., That's given me a reason to live.," Yeah, it's not like everyone's gonna suddenly start holding hands and making out, but we figure, why not throw a big three-day outdoor party, show everyone a good time, and maybe they'll forget about this stupid stuff."," What do you think? I don't I don't I don't even You know what I mean? What's wrong with her? Why is making those noises? Oh, right, you don't know Leslie.", That means she loves it so much she can't speak.," You guys, that's like I don't know Amazing.", Like what you do there., Happy anniversary., So I know we agreed on no gifts., - What? - But I did get you a gift., - No.," - A bunch of them, actually."," I was gonna surprise you with them yesterday, but they never reached you.", Ahem.," Oh, my eff-ing God.", You planned all of this for me? An enchanted carriage? This is amazing.," Oh, and your scrapbook instincts are really good."," I mean, this is a little rough, but you have a lot of talent here."," Oh, I can't believe I actually defeated Leslie Knope at a gift exchange."," - Yes! - Uh, yeah.", About that., Happy anniversary., It's the Iron Throne., Ohh! It's the Iron Throne.," Yes, it is.", I had a guy at the model store make a replica., He's a bigger Game of Thrones fan than you are.," Okay, I know I'm making that dumb surprise face, but I can't help it."," This is the greatest gift I've ever received, Leslie."," When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die.", Yes., No., Yes., No! Come here.," Come hither, peasant.", Come here., Who are you? Our starship is in trouble.," Okay, Leslie, listen.", If you're not if you don't know what you're talking about   ,"
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 15,"Okay, Ron.",Enough's enough.,Let's talk plans for Diane's baby shower.,"Dear God, woman.","Three main activities baby bingo, baby food tasting, and my personal favorite baby onesie decorating station.",I'm gonna make mine look like an astronaut.,"What are you doing up there in space, baby?",Ah!,So cute!,Okay.,I have some gift ideas.,I was looking at a very adorable stroller.,We already have a stroller.,"Oh, shoot.",Really?,I'm gonna have to think of something else.,"Oh, my God, whose baby is that?",That would be mine.,"Guys, get in here!",Ron has a baby!,"Oh, Ron, cool baby.","Thank you, Andrew.","Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to my son, John middle name redacted Swanson.","John was born some time ago, weighing multiple pounds and several ounces.","Much like his father, he is a fan of silence.",Please keep your voices down.,"How am I supposed to keep my voice down when you had your baby, and you didn't tell me that you had your baby?",Why would you need to know something like that?,"Why would I oh, my God.",I have not even sent Diane a gift.,"She's just walking around, wondering why I haven't sent her a gift yet.",Should we do something?,Just let her tire herself out.,"If you need anything from us, Ron, please just let us know.",Actually there is something.,Could one of you please stop by the pet store and pick up some fish food for me?,When did you get a fish?,"Okay, youth committee.",Update on the unity concert.,Madison.,"So far, 12 bands have said yes.",And we asked them all to submit a song for the new town anthem contest.,I think we should book Orin as a headliner.,I think it's a nobrainer.,"Um, he dislocates his shoulder to the music of Billy Joel.","The Pawnee Journal called it, ""Why would anyone do this?",""" Stop suggesting Orin.","Craig, any update on the art tents?",signed up to show their work.,"It was going to be 15, but then this one guy described himself as ""Jackson Pollockesque"" and I told him that's finger painting for adults and I hate it!","The PawneeEagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town.","But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success, Pawnee might once again tolerateslashignore me.","I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the bestcase scenario.",You guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.,I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.,No one knows who that is?,"Um, I do.","""Grant Larson,"" otherwise known as Elton John.","Congratulations, Leslie.","No, Grant Larson is the director of the Midwest branch of the National Park Service.",He's basically the Liam Bonneville of the Midwest.,Liam Bonneville?,The department of the interior's resident bad boy?,"He's basically the Tim Dweck Okay, never mind.",I have asked Grant to declare Eagleton Hills a national park as the grand finale of our unity concert.,"Great idea, Leslie.","And with that update, the Pawnee new founder's day unity concert is now officially ahead of schedule!",And that banner unfurling marks the 100th time that one of my projects has been ahead of schedule.,"This is your chance to put your names on the Pawnee unity concert, the biggest event of 2014 besides the unveiling of Tricia's new highlights.",You think I wouldn't notice?,"You look fly as hell, girl!","This unity concert needs corporate sponsorship, so Ben and I are meeting with local bigwigs.",I'm gonna do what I do best lock down deals.,And dorkasaurus over here is gonna handle the boring stuff.,You said you genuinely valued my business acumen.,"Also, I'm your boss.","Oh, my God, he's so cute.",You're the cutest little boobear I've ever seen.,You are the world's most adorable baby and I love you!,You are so freaking precious!,Look what Gayle made for the baby.,"It says ""Property of Pawnee government.",""" Isn't that adorable?","Come on, John.",Jeez.,Here we are the park that borders Pawnee and Eagleton.,This is the perfect place for the press conference to announce our unity concert.,"People are gonna clap, they're gonna cheer.",Today might be the day that I finally crowd surf.,I should probably empty my pockets just in case.,"Hey, one question.","Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says ""Pawnee, you suck,"" or ""Go home, Eagleton snobs""?",I painted over that graffiti a week ago.,These people are the worst!,I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.,"Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it.","You know, why do we even have this wall?","We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them.",We should just knock it down.,"On it, boss.",Ahh!,Ow.,The koolaid guy makes it look so easy.,"In the time I've worked here, I've taken great pains to see as little of this building as possible.","Turns out the third floor is silent, empty, and completely free of government work.",I can't think of anything more beautiful to share with my son.,If I had a toolbox I could take care of that faulty radiator.,Ooh!,This place is a paradise!,"Nicely done, Tom.",We have 15 sponsorship offers.,Make that 16.,Mitch Savner.,Savner Bleaches and Chemicals!,That's it.,You guys make my favorite teethwhitening strips pearlies for girlies.,It's unisex.,The cartoon princess on the label says so.,I'll sponsor your concert.,But I'm also looking to invest in other ventures.,I have a feeling a bright guy like you has some ideas of his own.,I may have a few eggs ready to hatch in the personal idea nest.,Why don't you come to my office tomorrow and pitch me your hottest idea?,Perfect!,I'll see you then.,"Oh, that's pretty cool.","It's all happening, Ben.","Soon I'll have a new career, new crib, new friends.","If all goes well, this may be one of the last times I ever have to speak to you.","Come with me, I need your help.","Thank you so much, everyone, for coming.",And a special thank you to the city council for their support.,I was told there'd be a free barbecue buffet?,Just take some beef jerky andhush!,This spring we will be holding a massive unity concert to commemorate the merger between Pawnee and Eagleton.,"This threeday music and arts festival will end on a day we will call ""New Founder's Day,"" an official beginning to our new town.","A few years ago, Eagleton put up this wall along the border.",Now it is time to tear down this wall.,"In the name of unity, I have given some former Eagletonians the first strike.","Take it away, guys.",This is such a great day for Bees!,Bees!,Oh!,Nobody panic!,"Ohhh, noooo!",Ah!,It stung me in the eyeball!,"Oh, man, this is amazing, man.",The stupid Eagletonians are totally getting the pwned by these bees.,I'm gonna send this straight to tosh.,"[Laughing] Ow, [bleep]!",[Bleep]!,"Don't worry, babe, I'll protect you.","I got stung once, I'm immune.","Go ahead and sting me, bees.",It does nothing.,"Leslie, it appears that most of the people that were stung were from Eagleton.",How did you pull that off?,I didn't pull anything off.,The Eagletonians were simply closest to the wall.,"Plus, one Pawneean was stung in his mouth because he was laughing at the Eagletonians.","How did you get your bees into the wall, and how long did it take to plan this hilarious bee prank on Eagleton?","They were not my bees, Trodd.",And for the last time this was not a prank.,I did not know that bees were in that wall.,"I mean, in fact you should treat this like a public service announcement.",Everybodyshould check their walls for bees.,"Nice try, prank queen.",Probably bees in there.,"Okay, that's all the time I have.",What else can you do with your bees?,"Leslie, what's your next prank?",Ooh.,"Leslie, Grant Larson is on the phone from the National Park Service.",I cannot meet with him right now.,"We are in crisis mode, okay?","Larry, just tell him I need to reschedule because I am trying to fix my bee hole disaster.",Okeydokey.,Wait!,"No, wait!",No!,"Larry, don't tell him that.",Don't mention my bee hole.,"Just as we suspected, John.","We repaired the valve stem seal, and now all that remains is to tighten down this packing nut.",Andthat should do it.,Can we help you?,No.,We have everything under control.,My crew's redoing this whole floor.,We're the only people allowed up here right now.,"Well, proceed with your work.",You won't notice us at all.,We're gonna be kinda loud.,My son is several weeks old.,He's quite familiar with the sound of power tools.,"Okay, how about this one Lasik for fingernails?","Cut your fingernails once, never have to cut 'em again.",All we need is a complicated laser I have no idea how to build.,Seems impossible.,All right.,Uhoh!,"""Saltweens!",""" Saltines for tweens.",Seemsunnecessary?,The only business idea I have that's even remotely fleshed out is a restaurant.,No way.,"Restaurants were ranked number one in Accounting Magazine's ""Riskiest Businesses"" issue.","That was their last issue before they folded, actually.",Magazines are also very risky.,"I can't believe an angel investor floated down from the heavens, and I don't even have anything to pitch him.","Come on, you must've had one good business idea.",You're 52 years old!,"No, I'm not.",But I do have an idea.,It's airtight.,"But I have to warn you, it's not super sexy.",What is it?,"Okay, listen up.",You would be the middleman between dry cleaners and the companies that sell chemicals to dry cleaners.,Wow!,Right?,"You're right, man.",That is not sexy.,Leslie Knope's little stunt put three people in the hospital.,This bee incident is just the latest assault coming from the Pawnee side of this merger.,Mike Patterson is Eagleton's most tenacious reporter.,"When he sinks his teeth into something, he's like a dog with a bone!","Oh, my God!",You can't lean in to whisper and then yell.,That's not fair.,"This merger is so fragile, everyone is on edge, and no one is talking about the unity concert.",Why would anybody think that was a prank?,So sad.,People will believe anything.,"It was a prank though, right?","No more press, okay?",You just have to lay low for a while.,I promise it'll all blow over.,"April, your competence and your levelheadedness is very moving to me, and I will follow your advice right after I go to the hospital and apologize to every victim in person.","Fine, but no cameras.","Fine, I won't bring any.",Aghh!,I can't handle all this fighting.,It's like Thanksgiving 2004 all over again!,Don't even ask!,"Somebody follow me, I'm distraught!",Who's a big guy?,"Man, forget about working.",I just wanna stare at this baby all day.,What is the nature of your work on this floor?,"Total redonew floors, fixtures, plumbing.",How long will it take?,Six to eight weeks.,Deal.,I will do all this work for you in the time allotted.,Just have your tools and materials brought up here.,Are you crazy?,This is enough work for a whole crew.,"I'm sure the government believed you when you told them that, and I tip my cap to you for profiting off their ignoe.","But I'm offering you two months paid vacation and the ability to take credit for my work, which will be flawless.",Okay.,"Guys, let's go!",I got all help I'll need right here.,"Okay, this is the really exciting part.",We buy tetrachloroethylene at $1.,"60 a gallon, but we sell it back at 2.",38 a gallon.,Now I know what you're thinking.,What if it's a cleaner who wants to buy glycol ethers?,"Ben, stop!",This is so boring!,This is like listening to a TED talk by the color beige.,"Look, I know this idea doesn't excite you.",But I promise it'll make you a lot of money.,"Well, I sold tons of awesome stuff.",Guess it makes sense my next challenge is to sell something mindnumbingly dull.,Dull?,Does this look dull to you?,Ahhhh.,I'm so incredibly sorry.,"That's very kind of you, Ms.",Knope.,I hope you look a lot less gross very soon.,Hey!,"Thanks for coming, Knope.",I knew we were besties.,"What do you got in there for me, some dirty mags?",No!,These gift baskets are for innocent victims not for jerks who got stung because they were laughing at other people's pain.,Whatever.,Got a lotta filth in my kindle anyway.,We can just hang.,Wanna come up?,What?,We gotta get this.,Roll camera.,Tell me when.,Is my hair okay?,We good?,"Welcome to Eagleton Now, with Mike Patterson.","We're live ambushing Leslie Knope who's in the middle of a crass publicity stunt, shoving cameras cameras into the faces of these poor, injured victims.",These are your cameras.,This is not a publicity stunt.,I just came here by myself to apologize to all the Eagletonians who got stung.,Really?,"Because all we see is you talking to your friend, known Eagleton hater Jeremy Jamm.","Excuse me, Mike.","That's, uh, best friend.",Pawneeans and Eagletonians need to find a way to come together and bury the hatchet.,"It doesn't matter who bailed out who, or who seceded from you.","Awesome idea, Lezzie.",As a matter of fact I say we should secede from Eagleton!,Whose dumbass idea was it for them to merge anyway?,Mine.,It was my idea.,You heard it here first.,Selfproclaimed dumbass Leslie Knope and councilman Jeremy Jamm are spearheading a Pawnee secession movement.,"And I, for one, am sick of it.","All right, you know what, Eagleton, enough!",Get these cameras outta here!,"Don't touch my camera, you Pawnee animal!","Namecalling, huh?","Classy move, douche bag.",Oh!,All right.,Is that how you wanna play?,Yeah!,Come on!,No fighting in a hospital.,There shouldn't be fighting in a hospital!,Wish I had my ninja stars!,"Oh, my God!",What's happening?,Oh!,Motherpuncher!,"Hey, girl.",What up?,What are you wearing?,It's to distract people from my black eye.,See?,It's working.,Cool.,"Um well, there is some good news.","That Mike Patterson guy's show just aired, everyone is angry, and Jamm is introducing a secession bill at the next city council meeting.",How is any of that good news?,It's not.,I just wanted you to have a brief moment of happiness before you got sadder.,Those jerks that hate the merger are a minority.,They're just shouting louder than everyone else.,I'm sorry this town keeps being stupid and letting you down.,It sucks.,"It's okay, April.",It's fine.,"You know, it's a challenge.","It's just like a big, fun stinking turd nugget.",It sucks.,"You're right, everything sucks.",Everything I try with this merger backfires.,I wonder what other excellent surprise lies in store for Leslie Knope.,"Leslie, Grant Larson from the National Park Service is here for your meeting.",Excellent.,Now I shall meet with a very important person whilst sporting a gruesome shiner.,"Hey, you're also wearing a tiedye tshirt.","Oh, yes!",I am!,Wonderful!,Mitch!,Thanks for meeting me.,My pleasure.,It's not often that I see someone with your sparkle and passion.,That's what makes businesses work passion!," So, Mr."," Haverford, let's get to it."," What idea are you passionate about? I've got two words for you-- ""Tom's Bistro,"" an old-fashioned, old-world Italian restaurant."," Classy, authentic ambience in a small-town setting."," Why does that say ""dry cleaning chemical transactional holding company?"" Ben! You brought the wrong easel.", God! Can't take this guy anywhere., Let me paint you a picture.," Oh, Mr."," Larson, I'm sorry.", I had to reschedule., It's been kind of a hectic week., - What happened to your face? - It doesn't matter., I would like to apply to turn some of our new land into a national park.," I read your request, Ms."," Knope, and I'm sorry, but we can't make that happen.", Great.," Well, this week just keeps getting better and better.", Thank you for coming by and plunging a dagger into my already-bleeding corpse., I came here because I wanted to meet you., I've actually wanted to meet you since before you called me., - Really? You know who I am? - Yes., You're the person who wrote this., You read my proposal to clean up the Pawnee river? I wrote this two years ago., Got shuffled around in interior for a year and half.," Liam Bonneville actually used it to humiliate staffers, but he's kind of a bad boy.", Liam B-- - You don't have to tell me! - This report is legendary., It's easily the most thoroughly research and passionate grant request I've ever seen.," Wow, you have no idea how meaningful it is to hear you say that.", But you're a little late., The river cleanup's well underway., This is bigger than the river cleanup., We're opening a new office in Chicago., I spent the last few weeks reading about you and your career and I think that you're the perfect person to run it.," Leslie, would you like to run a branch of the National Park Service? Tom's Bistro will have all the classic elements, but with modern twists-- an oak bar, live music, and Sunday brunch with scrambled eggs so fluffy they'll be like little pillows for your bacon.", Bacon pillows., I like the sound of that.," But I have to say, restaurants are incredibly risky.", Most of them are dead on arrival.," We're well-aware of that, but believe me, Tom has thought this out."," See, there's plenty of real estate available in the old Eagleton part of town."," And with the recent closures, there's massive demand for affordable dining that feels high-end."," Okay! As long as you're running, I'm in."," Amazing! Hey, kid your boss here sure knows his stuff.", Ron., What are you doing here? The most important government work I've ever done-- sanding rat urine stains out of this floor., What are you doing here? I come here to think sometimes., By myself., - But now that you're here - Damn it.," I am going to speak to you very vaguely about a problem that I have, and you cannot ask me any questions or details about it."," That is my ideal conversation, aside from no conversation.", But that feels unlikely.," Look, you know how much I love Pawnee.", But the more I try to fix it the more people fight me.," They call me names, they recall me, they try to kill the merger.", They literally punch me in the face.," And yet every time I contemplate leaving, just walking away once and for all, I just can't do it."," What is wrong with me? Yesterday, I fixed that old steam radiator."," Threaded a new valve into the side, removed the handle from the base, unscrewed the packing nut from the stem."," This subpar toolbox only had one wrench, so I was lucky it was a three-quarters or I'd have been screwed."," Yeah, man, you are lucky."," Come on, Ron.", What the hell? I need your help.," By the time I was done, this 100-year-old piece of American-made cast iron was singing like a bird."," Nowto most people, this story would seem boring.", That's ridiculous., It's a story about a radiator.," But to me, it was immensely satisfying because I enjoy fixing radiators."," You like fixing this town, Leslie, you always have."," You know it's an uphill battle, but you love the struggle."," I would also add that you've already done a hell of a lot to make this town better, and people like this young man here will benefit from your hard work.", - He is a beautiful boy., - He's quite a looker.," Thank you, Ron.", - What's that? - Nothing., Clearing my throat., I've been thinking about your offer., And I have to say I can't think of one single reason not to take it., That's great! I'll start drawing up the paperwork.," I'm sorry, I meant because I can think of a lot of reasons not to take it."," Okay, wow, that's very misleading phraseology.", I'm sorry.," It's an amazing offer and I'm very interested, but if I'm going to leave Pawnee I need to know it's gonna be okay without me.", And I won't know until I finish what I've started.," When do you need your answer? Well, the gears of federal government grind pretty slowly, so you have a little time.", But we can't wait forever., I'll be in touch., Great., Thank you., That's not your hand., Here it is.," Sorry, my depth perception is totally screwed up."," Really happy that worked out for you, Tom, but you kinda sold me out back there."," I know, and I'm sorry."," But Mitch asked me what I was passionate about, and honestly I'm never gonna be passionate about dry cleaning chemicals."," To each his own, I guess."," I know opening a restaurant is risky, but I can make this work.", I know I can! Then count me in as the second investor in Tom's Bistro.," Thanks, man."," I know this is a symbolic gesture, but my investor floor is $1,000."," So as of now, you own zero shares.", Cool! Thanks for clearing that up.," Now go do work, or I will fire you.", I'm not kidding.," Yep! Oh, look, John.", It's red pine., They were gonna put flecked linoleum over this beautifully preserved knotty red pine.," Most people in this world, John, are ass[bleep]."," This is the best day I've ever spent in a government building, and luckily my son was here to share it with me.", He now has that satisfied look that only comes with the pride of labor., Or he pooped.," Either way, well done, John.",   ,"
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 16,"Okay, I don't want to overhype this, but presenting Dundadadah!",the new city of Pawnee website!,Totally revamped!,"You can pay parking tickets, you can apply for a business license and the best part is we're going to put up an online poll so people can pick the new town slogan!","Hey, look a panda!","Yeah, that's just some mascot thing that the designer put up on the front page.","But more importantly, you can now apply for a utility tax refundonline!","Wait, the panda's name is Peebo.",Peebo.,"Look, you can even play pingpong.",What?,I want to play!,"No, me first!",Me first!,That's it.,I'm calling it.,"Guys, Ben worked really hard on this, okay?",Let's look at the online polls.,It's gonna be a cool way to choose our new town's slogan.,Oh!,The panda holds a paddle with his tail.,I want to play!,"Congratulations, Ben.",This is truly a fine panda game you made.,Well done.,What else does he do?,"I think if you click on the bamboo, it puts on a top hat.",What?,"I love you, Ben!",What's wrong with you?,You look like Meryl Streep at the end of Ironweed.,You wish.,"Well, I've been driving all over Indiana looking for bands to play the unity concert.","I got nothing to show for, except for four car accidents.",All these strangers' insurance information.,"Ooh, I get it, you have car insurance.",Why don't you brag about it?,"Hey, you are from Eagleton, right?",Are there any places out there I should check out?,I used to go see live shows at Patterson's.,But I'm boycotting until the owner apologizes for what she said to me at the dog park.,Cool.,Anything else?,I hear Cozy's Bar is pretty packed on Thursdays.,But I've never been because it's mostly middleaged women and I'm allergic to turkey neck.,Really?,That's the best part.,We should split a turkey sometime.,"Oh, Mr.",Larson.,Thank you so much for meeting me here.,Happy to.,I was in the area.,The chance for me to return your binder full of questions about the job.,I think I answered all of them.,Thank you.,I cannot wait to check this out.,"Now, the reason why I asked you to meet me here More questions about the job.","Oh, yeah.",Martha?,I'm gonna need two hours worth of waffles.,Grant Larson has offered me a chance to oversee a branch office of the national park service.,This is like the parks equivalent of Bruce Springsteen pulling Courtney Cox onstage.,"I mean, one minute you're just a regular girl in the crowd, and the next minute you're dancing 10 feet away from freakin' Max Weinberg!","Okay, my fortieth and eighteenth from last question is about the Heartland Exotic Plant Management Project.","Now, were would I be actually doing the physical planting?","Because it is always been a dream of mine to plant spotted jewelweed along the red river bank in Arkansas, but I'm sure you hear that a lot.","Well, you wouldn't actually be planting things.","I mean, you're overseeing The everyday minutia you would delegate to staff.","Leslie, your job is more creative, big picture stuff.",No more boring people working for you.,Good!,I hate paperwork.,I hardly ever do it in my bed on a Saturday night while listening to old spice girls CDs.,Regal Meagle.,My favorite realtor.,You got some hot properties to show me?,You know it.,"Remember my list of musthaves: Open kitchen, fireplace, exposed brick, and you know I wouldn't kick a skylight out of bed.","I'm opening Pawnee's first authentic Sinatra style Italian restaurant ""Tom's Bistro.",""" I'm kind of like a skinny, handsome, Indian Mario Batali who doesn't know how to cook.","Before we go, I got you guys a little something for helping me out.",Oh!,Love it!,A Larry voodoo doll?,"Tom, that's so sweet.",Thanks.,Ow!,"Oh, my gosh!",I didn't even do anything.,The voodoo doll is reading my thoughts.,"So it seems like it went really well, right?",Yeah.,"Yeah, totally.","Grant is great, the job is great.",The waffles were great.,Great.,So we're just about ready to go live with the slogan poll.,You want to see?,"Now that Eagleton and Pawnee have merged, it is time to pick a new town slogan.",And a slogan can make a big difference with tourism in a town's identity.,"There is New York, the city that never sleeps.","And then there is Glenwater, Florida, home of America's most violent Walmart parking lot.","Okay, so people can vote now.","Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy.",No.,"No, we're not gonna do that.",We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.,"Um, what?","There's a lot of nittygritty left to do, Ben.","We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass.",You know what we should do?,"We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll.","Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them.","Well, II did.",So this was one of Eagleton's top sushi restaurants.,But you can't outrun the whale meat police forever.,This is great.,I love it!,"Look at it, I can picture it now.","That's where the politicians will sit, this is where the connected guys will bring their goomahs.",This place is perfect.,How much?,"9,000 a month.",What?,That's way more that I can afford.,Whatever.,It's not that great.,"Plus, it's really far away from work and that'd be annoying.",It's not a big deal.,"I mean, when it first launches I'll go back and forth, but hopefully it takes off and it'll become a fulltime job.","Come on, I'll show some places in your price range.","This press junket is a brilliant idea, isn't it?",Mr.,Strange Cameraman Who I Never Met.,"Leslie, I told you, I'm not gonna participate in your weird Julia Roberts, cameraman husband fantasy.","Quiet, cameraman, Perd's here.","Leslie, your poll is designed to choose a new slogan.",And a slogan is a series of words that have a meaning.,"So true, Perd.","All of the choices for the town slogan are wonderful, but if I had to choose my favorite it would probably be ""Storied past, bright future.",""" Well, the story of my interest level is: It's medium.","Joan, this poll is a chance to give our newlymerged city a new identity to really rebrand this town.","Yes, great question.",I have been thinking of rebranding myself.,What do you think about Juan Callamezzo?,"Isn't ""Juan"" a man's name?","No, it means ""flower.",""" I think it means ""John.",""" Crazy Ira and the Douche from 93.","7 FM, the Groove.","Leslie, do you believe that this new slogan will integrate Pawnee and Eagleton into one cohesive city?","Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira.","Yes, yes, I do.","Followup question, Leslie, show us your boobs!",Will this fit on a bumper sticker?,"Gosh, this place is packed.",You folks must really like this guy.,"Honey, he is sex on a stick.","Ladies and gentlemen, put your jazzy hands together for my man, Mr.",Duke Silver!,A smooth and silky evening to you all.,"On nights like this, when the cold winds blow, and the air is awash in the swirling eddies of our dreams, come with me and find safe haven in a warm bathtub full of my jazz.",Uh!,"Well, the good news is your poll was a big hit.",Thousands of people voted.,That's great.,What's leading?,"""Storied past, bright future""?",No.,"The current leader is ""Pawnee, welcome to Douche nation.","""  What?",Crazy Ira and the Douche got their bonehead radio fans to flood the poll with writein votes.,Why did we include a writein option?,Because every election has a writein option.,That's how democracy works.,I'm not a dictator.,"If I we're a dictator, I would throw the Douche in prison without a trial.","I would be a very strong dictator, and you would be my bodyguard, and you would lead my army.","Okay, I know we should figure out how to fix this.","But I'm starting to get kind of turned on imagining you as a dictator, is that bad?","No, it's okay.","You know, we could just figure out a different strategy for picking a slogan.",You don't have to go on their show.,"No, I want to do this.",I enjoy the challenge.,"So, how do I look?","I need these guys to think that I'm, like, super chill.",Is this gonna work?,"Oh, what up, Lez?",Backwards hatshows a real lack of respect for authority.,I like that.,"What's up, little mayor?",Are you gonna freak out again?,"So, Leslie, what's the deal?",Are you just here to yell at us again?,"Yeah, we are in store for another Leslie Knope nag sesh?","Crazy Ira, do the dishes!",Classic!,No way!,"I'm not here to nag, guys.","I'm just psyched to be in the studio, you know?",I'm justchillin' in the studes with my dudes.,"If you're really not really here to nag us, then maybe you'll help us with our next segment ""Rating celebrities' boobs!",""" Perfect.","On a scale, from 1 to gagagagoing!",How would you rate Emma Watson's boobs?,"First of all, I would rate her acting as an ""A.",""" You have three seconds to answer or we're gonna withdraw  a donation from charity.",From charity?,Oh.,A minus.,More like double D minus.,Me so horny!,I knew it.,I knew it.,Can I help you?,Maybe.,I was out at the jazz club last night scouting bands for the unity concert.,And I saw something very interesting.,I am Duke Silver.,I have a twin brother.,What?,I have a twin brother.,You are Duke Silver?,"Yes, I am Duke Silver.",The only other people who know are Tom and April.,"So, please, keep it to yourself.",Are you kidding me?,You are really good!,"You are, like, the saxophone player for the Californiaraisinsgood.",No joke.,You know what?,I'm booking you for the unity concert.,Absolutely not.,My musical career is private.,"If my secret got out, this office would be waistdeep in women's undergarments.","No, I'm in charge of booking the bands for the concert, and I say, you're in.",You're gonna play right after Bobby knight ranger.,It's a night ranger cover band where they only wear read sweaters.,It's gonna be epic!,"Final round, Leslie, boobs or ass?",Hard to believe this is a fan game for your radio listeners.,AhI'm gonna say butt.,"Ding, ding, ding!",Yes!,You are correct.,This is my mom's dumper!,"Oh, mommy!",I don't know how you got yours hand on that.,I took it.,Good.,"Well, it is been so fun broing out with my dogs.",I never knew that objectifying women could be so much fun.,"We're running out of time here so just a quick reminder to writein ""Welcome to Douche nation!",""" As the official town slogan for pawneecity.",gov.,Or you know what would also be kind of dope for the people of Douche nation to do?,It's vote for another slogan.,"Like, you know, ""Storied past, bright future""?",ButI don't care.,"I don't give a fart, bros.","You know, just do your thing, chicken wing.","Hey, Crazy Ira, have you seen my stick?",Where's your stick?,I don't know.,"Lesbo Baggins, you know where my stick is?",You  Oh!,Found my stick.,"Oh, where did you find it?",Up Leslie Knope's butt!,"Yo, where my stick up?","It's up her butt, papi.","Jewish Greg, whatever we're paying you, it's not enough.","Damn it, I almost pulled that off.","No, you really didn't.",Just delete the poll.,Let the slogan thing go.,"Or, maybe we sneak back in there you distract those guys for, like, 30, 90 minutes, I get on live radio, I give an impassioned speech about what slogan I want to endorse and I play a few songs, which I always wanted to do, and then we just see what happens.",No.,I should just let this go.,Okay.,"Dude, what are you doing?",That looks like a perfectly good saxophone case.,Wait a minute.,What's inside that case?,I am ending my secret musical career.,I have to kill Duke Silver.,"No, come on, man.",You're really good.,You can't quit.,"Sorry, Andrew.",I would rather never play again than have everyone know my secret.,"Goodbye, Duke Silver.",May you restin jazz.,"So, Tom told you are sort of like a computer expert.",Uhyeah.,You can say that.,"These jerks are trying to hijack my online poll, and so far the leading town slogan is, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt.",""" Yeah, yeah.",I voted for that one.,Great.,"I'm wondering, is there a way I can communicate  with everybody who voted?","Yeah, I can do that.",Should take about two minutes.,Just PayPal me some bitcoins when you get a chance.,What?,"So, this is way under your budget.",Used to be a donut shop.,"Well, a tire shop  that sold donuts.",Pretty rough.,"I mean, I guess I could fix the roof and tear up the counters.",Do something about the smell.,This place is creepy.,"I mean, I love it, because it reminds me of the cafeteria in a haunted nursing home, but that's just me.",This is the last listing I have that isn't an active crime scene.,"Hey, man, what happened?",I thought Jurassic Fork was super popular.,We stretched ourselves too thin by expanding to a second location.,You opened another dinosaurthemed restaurant?,"No, another Steven Spielbergthemed restaurant.",The German place downtown Schindler's Lunch.,I think you may have misunderstood what people liked about Jurassic Fork.,I actually think the space is pretty cool.,"Obviously, we'd had to move this TRex, but No can do.",That's a loadbearing TRex.,This is really the last place you have available?,Dang.,Maybe Tom's Bistro wasn't meant to be.,You wanted to see me?,"Yeah, real quick.",Remember when you said you would close up shop  on the slogan thing?,Yes.,"You did do that, right?","You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the ""Stick up the butt"" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?",Are you crazy?,What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.,"Well, someone wrote those emails.",And we got about 300 complaints and as a cherry on top some hackers got really mad about the invasion of privacy and attacked the website.,Look what they did to Peebo.,He's wearing a hat made of penises.,"Oh, boy.","Well, I.",T.,"is fixing the website, but it will be down for about three days.","Well, no worries, I will handle all of the overflow work personally.","Parking tickets, code violations  send them all to me.",What's going on?,I don't know.,"I spoke to grant about the national parks job, and he mentioned that's mostly big picture planning and delegating, and not very much nittygritty, handson stuff that I love to do.","I would miss that, very much.","I mean, have I really pulled my last bloated raccoon carcass from a public fountain?","But that's the whole point of moving up the ladder, you get to think bigger, swim in a bigger pond.","You're having a public forum on the slogan, right?",Use it as a test.,"Hand the reins to someone else, let them handle things while you manage from a distance.",Yeah.,That's a good idea.,I guess I should practice delegating.,Ugh!,Okay.,"The public forum will be run by Oh, no, I would not have started the sentence if I knew Larry was the only one here.","Babe, if you can step back and let Larry take control, you can survive anything.",All right.,"Larry, can you get in here?",I would love to.,Gosh darn it.,II somehow ran my belt through a slat in this chair so I'm kind ofI'm kind of stuck to it now.,Great.,You really shouldn't have dug that out of the dumpster.,I had to.,Also I had a banana on the way over here.,Sorry.," I get why you don't want any more to know about Duke Silver, and you don't have to worry.", You secret is safe with me.," To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets."," Oh, no, that's not necessary.", I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks., I didn't actually sell my last car., I just forgot where I parked it., I don't know who Al Gore is., And at this point I'm too afraid to ask.," When they say 2% milk, I don't know what the other 98% is."," When I was a baby, my head was so big scientists did experiments on me."," I once threw beer at a swan, and then it attacked my niece Rebecca."," That'll do, Andrew.", You don't have to play the unity concert., But don't quit music., Please., - Tommy., - Hey., - Are you okay? - Yeah., I just got excited about the restaurant but I should probably call my investor and tell him we have a problem.," Well, I got you something to cheer you up.", Watch cologne., Cologne for watches., Thanks., Things used to make me so happy., But I've grown a lot in the last year.," Now I just want one big thing, my own restaurant, named after me, that makes me so much money I can buy anything I want.", I should go.," I didn't want Tom to leave, so I said all these bad things about the restaurant, so he wouldn't like them."," Damn, we should have coordinated.", I don't want to lose that weird little elf either., That's why I showed him all those crappy places.," Oh, I thought you were just bad at your job.", Sorry., What should we do? Let me call some people.," Hello, everyone, and welcome to a public forum to choose our new town slogan."," I'm gonna hand things over to Larry Gengurch, who is 100% in charge."," Well, let's just get started, huh? I want to talk about-- Oh, it's the-- geez Louise-- This keeps happening.", I don't know why.," I think the slogan should be ""Pawnee, home of crackers, the orangest goldfish in Indiana.",""" - Okey-dokey.", - No., Let me write it down.," - Who even needs a slogan? - Well, now, that is an interesting point."," No, that's my slogan idea."," ""Who even needs a slogan?"" And then a big picture of me flipping everybody off."," Let's keep our eye on the ball here, Douche nation, ""Home of the stick up Leslie Knope's butt.",""" Butt stick! Butt stick! Butt stick! Let's vote on it right now! Butt stick! Butt stick! Okay."," Who's next? Yes, ma'am.", This slogan is gonna go on every sign in town., I think it should be something real that we can all be proud of.," I've lived in Pawnee my whole life and it could be a strange place, but overall it's a warm, and wonderful town."," My idea for a slogan is, ""When you're here, then you're home.",""" Well, that's lovely.", I actually had it printed up so we can see what it would look like.," Oh, you-- Hm--there's--that's--that's spelled wrong."," That should be ""then"", t-h-e-n.", Stay strong., Let them work it out., And trust Larry., Trust Larry? Are you listening to yourself? I like that slogan a lot., But you made a little mistake there., - You see? - Back off.," ""You're"" is spelled wrong."," It should be ""y-o-u-r.",""" Oops, I didn't catch it.", Thank you.," No, no, no, she made a possessive.", - She's getting further away., - It's okay.," Okay, let's vote.", All those in favor.," Approved! Man, the places that came on the market today are way nicer than the listings we saw yesterday."," I know, crazy, right? Real estate."," This property is under your budget, and it's got everything on this wish list you gave me.", Except the two helipads., Does it have one helipad? I don't know.," I like it, butseems a little small."," No, I think it just seems small because of all the heavy furniture.", But that part is really great., The lighting is really cool., I think this is the one.," You know, I think you're right.", I'll do it.," Thanks, April."," And, hey, bonus, it's pretty close to city hall.", You guys are gonna be regulars., I'll keep a table open for you., And special thanks to Leslie Knope for once again bringing about positive change to this town.," Pawnee, I present to you, your new slogan.", You fixed the mistakes., I held it together for the entire meeting., Let me have this one., I'm done micromanaging., I promise., Then I'm sure you are okay with the fact that they installed the sign the wrong way and it's welcoming you to Pawnee as you're leaving.," What? No! Oh, son of a-- Hey, you passed the test."," Honestly, there's something else I'm worried about."," The kind of work that I've been doing all these years, the nuts and bolts, the grunt work, that's the stuff I know how to do.", What if I take this national parks jobs and I justfail? - Hm., - What if I'm not good at it? Yeah.," Leslie, I love you, very much.", But this is the stupidest thing you've ever said., You'd be amazing.," And everyone's gonna be in awe of how amazing you are, so just shut your month."," Hey, are we leaving or entering? We've been driving around in circles.", You're--   ,"

for our next phone call.,The worst part about your best friend living in another stupid state is the topics really pile up.,What do you think should be higher priority?,Infinity scarves or whether or not it's worth it for me to get Showtime?,Is this really necessary?,"When she moved, we promised each other that we would talk every day, and we've really fallen behind.","I know your female friends are very important to you, but I'm always a good sounding board.","I mean, I can talk about Sandra Bullock skirt length.","No, no, babe, you can'tyou would just embarrass yourself.","Plus, every time I start talking to you, five seconds later, I want to jump your bones.","Oh, let's do that instead.","See, that's what I'm talking about.","Yeah, okay, let's do this.",Okay.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",On to the unity concert.,Ben is meeting with the tent people to finalize those deals.,"April and Donna will be helping me with the vendor location charts, and I will be meeting with the surveyors about the concert grounds.",I would like to volunteer to do the park survey myself.,"Wow, Ron.",I always knew there would be a day when I would get through to you and you would love government work.,Today is that historic day.,Yes.,That is what has happened.,Spending the day outside alone sounds like a dream.,"I love being a father, but there are a few things I miss.","Silence, the absence of noise, one single moment undisturbed by the sounds of a children's TV program called Doc McStuffins.",There is no quiet anymore.,There is only Doc McStuffins.,Sorry I'm late.,"Uh, Andy, why don't you go with Ron and help him?",I really don't need  Shotgun!,I call shotgun.,Where are we going?,Doesn't matter.,Shotgun.,Shotgun on all rides for the rest of the day.,For the rest of my life.,In any car!,Ha ha!,I just faced you suckers!,"So I'll see you in the parking lot, Ron.",Later!,Is the tent guy lefthanded or righthanded?,I just need to know which way to part my hair to get us a better price.,It's a business theory I'm working on.,I really don't think it matters.,Pretty straightforward deal.,A straightforward deal?,Why didn't you tell me?,I don't have my straightforward deal fedora on me.,We gotta stop by my storage unit on the way up.,"Hey, Larry.","Hey, you wanna come with us to tent world?",Little road trip?,Tent world?,"Yeah, let me grab my lunch.",No.,Why'd you invite Larry?,He's been doing all the paperwork for this deal.,He deserves to come.,Remember you said that when Larry's farting up the car.,Larry isn't that bad.,He's nice.,"And frankly, I don't care who knows that I said that, as long as no one knows that I said that.","Okay, ladies, I will be in my office for one to seven hours for my weekly chat with Ann.",I brought some fresh snacks.,"And I made a backup plan for the vendor chart in case, you know, yours isn't good.","Actually, Ann called while you were in the bathroom.","She said something came up, she'll call you later.","I don't know, I told her to leave you a voice mail.",Ugh!,"God, why'd you let me say all that?","I'm coming, Ann's voice mail!",I'm coming!,Listen to me very carefully.,I have not been taken.,"I know that's always your first fear when I'm not available, but this is not a Liam Neeson Taken scenario.",That's exactly what they'd make you say.,"Also, no one's making me say this.","I am a free woman, untaken, simply going about my business.",I just have to run.,Something came up.,"I love you, and I'll call you later.",Donna.,"What's good, baby?",What's going down in Donna town?,What's the haps in Meaglewood?,I'm listening to Jaleel Or No Deal.,It's a podcast where the kid who played Urkel reviews old Deal Or No Deal episodes.,"It's pointless, and I love it.","Okay, don't let me interrupt.","April, what's the 411, little mama?",What's the hot goss?,Who you crushing on these days?,"Ew, my husband, weirdo.",Can I get back to work now?,Thanks.,Bye.,Work?,You can work whenever.,"Except for now, because now is lady time.",You sound like a tampon commercial.,I'm setting up an impromptu Galentine's day.,Really?,Yeah.,"Wait, I thought you weren't gonna do Galentine's day this year because that shebeast moved away.",I believe her name was Satan?,"Her name is Ann, and she is gone, and I have accepted it, and we are gonna have Galentine's day.","Ladies, up front.","I need an Ann who lives in Pawnee, and there is no one obvious candidate, so I will test them out on the ultimate battlefield of female friendship Galentine's day brunch.",It will be a women'sonly marathon bonding session with tons of whipped cream.,"Side note, do not Google that phrase.","Hey, Ron.",Can I ask you kind of an important question?,"You know, like, when you go to the ATM and you get money, is there an actual guy standing behind the wall who slides dollar bills in there?",No.,Yeah.,It's robots.,"Oh, actually, you know what?",I do have a serious question.,"In the movie Predator, can you rub any kind of mud on yourself to prevent predator from seeing you with his thermal heat signature sight, or is it more Ow!",That sucks.,Are you hurt?,No.,All good.,All good.,Oops.,Except for my mouth.,"Oh, whoa.",Fivesecond rule.,"No, ahh.","Come on, we better get you to a dentist.","Oh, my God, Larry.",Your tuna fish sandwich stunk up my suit.,Gayle made it for me.,Irrelevant.,You know what?,Stay out here and doublecheck these deal memos.,"If you get through 'em, triplecheck 'em.",Just don't come inside.,Sounds good.,I will finish my sandwich and enjoy the view.,"Hey, Harvey.",Ben Wyatt.,We spoke on the phone.,Yeah.,"Yeah, we sure did.",Okay.,Who's this little genie right here?,"Tom Haverford, Pawnee business liaison.",Okay.,Got your contracts for you right here.,Wow.,It's a lot thicker than the original onepage version.,"I take tents pretty seriously, Ben, I'm a tent guy.","I got over 1,300 tents in this warehouse alone.","over 2,000 square feet, and exactly 4 of 'em were once rented by Miss Rene Russo.",Whoa!,Yeah.,No doy.,I think I know what I'm doing.,So I added a few syllables and whatnot.,"Clauses, et cetera.","Addendums, what have you.",Why don't we go ahead and sign that for me?,"Yeah, I think we're gonna need to take a look at this.",Hmm.,So I guess this is not a straightforward deal.,"Shauna, I'm so glad you could make it.",You're so tan.,"Oh, thanks.",I just got back from a solo trip to Rome.,"I was gonna go with my boyfriend, but he couldn't come because he decided to stay with his wife.",Oof.,I love Rome.,It's such a great place.,Rome's played

decisions.","A real fixerupper, but look, it's not like Ann was doing so hot when I met her.",Ethel Beavers.,Bit of a dark horse.,"Crotchety, but probably wise.","And then we got Evelyn, aka fake Ann.",I don't know her last name.,Honestly we just needed bodies.,"Thank you, everyone, for getting together on such short notice, and happy Galentine's day.","Now, this is not technically the right date, but any time a group of women get together for brunch, we embody the spirit of the holiday.","Today we will celebrate friendship, spend a few hours together, and answer a couple of questions I've compiled.",Just for fun.,Nothing serious.,But please answer them with complete honesty 'cause I'll be able to tell if you're lying.,To girlfriends!,Yay.,Girlfriends.,Whoohoo!,"Okay, it's time for a little Galentine's day Q&A.","Donna, you pick first.","""What is your favorite TV show?",""" Well, for live tweeting, it's Scandal.","For binge watching, it's Scandal.","But for fashion, it's actually Scandal.",My answer is Scandal.,Hmm.,April?,"Ooh, I love watching Russian traffic accidents on YouTube while I play children's music at the wrong RPM.",I like beauty pageants.,Everyone is so happy and perfect.,I like Diagnosis Murder.,And skin flicks.,Can anybody top me off?,The correct answer for favorite TV show is Friday Night Lights.,The correct answer?,Next question.,"Okay, this contract is insane.",It costs extra to have people inside the tents?,And what's a flap tax?,"Well, you need flaps, bro.",A tent without flaps is basically a parachute.,An unfolding charge?,A noise damage waiver?,How can noise damage tents?,Shh.,"Keep your voice down, please, there's tents here.","Now, look, you can argue with me all you want, but for every line item that you two idiots disagree with, there's gonna be a $50 discussion surcharge.","What are we up to, doll?",$400.00 ,A discussion surcharge?,That's nuts.,$450.00 ,That's it.,Deal's off.,We'll take our business elsewhere.,"Suit yourself, gentlemen.",Sorry we couldn't make a deal.,"Wait, wait.",Let me try one more thing.,What's the price now?,$80 more.,I liked it better the other way.,"Does have an effect, though.",The receptionist says she'll fit you in as soon as there's an opening.,"If you're all right, I'm gonna head back to the park.","Wait, wait, wait, real quick, real quick.",Do you know what my social security number is?,Or if I'm allergic to anything?,I don't like corn.,Should I put that down?,Or will that be confusing?,Because I do like candy corn.,"Oh, Ron.",What a mess.,"Here, let me help you.",All I wanted was two hours where I got to forget that I was a parent.,"Ron, look.",I found all three differences.,Those are two completely different pictures.,"""Ladies' choice.","""  Ooh!",Wild card option.,"Okay, anybody reveal anything about their life, anything at all.",I've gotten two annulments.,"One for pleasure, and one to cap off a long con I was running against Keith Sweat.",Wow.,"Ethel, have you Okay, Ethel's asleep.",Shauna?,I'm writing a memoir based on my blog.,"It's called Tweeping Up Appearances, and it's about my journey to find happiness by smiling through the pain.","Okay, I can work with that.","Knope, what you got going on in that notebook?",Just jotting down memories in my trusty old journal.,"""Friendship rankings.",""" What's that?",It's not what it sounds like.,It's simply a way for me to figure out which one of you is the best.,That's messed up.,"Yeah, that is really lame, and I'm leaving.","You're better than that, Knope.","Donna, why are you angry?",You were in first place.,"Bye, everyone.",This was a really brunch.,Leave the bag.,"If you do this again next year, don't call me.","Well, by default, it's Shauna.","That's how you want to find your new best friend, right?",By default?,My pores are clogged up from being in that dusty warehouse.,I'm gonna check if this gas station has some biore strips.,"Aw, thanks, Larry, that's nice of you.",Gayle always has me do the windshield.,She likes to stand behind me and watch.,"According to her, it's the best view.",How is Gayle?,"Oh, wonderful.",And the girls?,They're good.,Why do you want to know?,I'm genuinely interested.,I'm sorry.,I'm just not used to people from the office asking me things.,It's kind of scary.,"But in a good way, though.","Aw, man, did I miss a Larry fart?","Oh, no, uh, we were just Yeah, Tom.","Yeah, II really ripped one.","Didn't I, Ben?",Yeah.,"Yeah, it was loud.",Smells like a hippopotamus took a dump on a skunk.,It's in your best interest.,"Well, the numbers don't lie.","I'm a goofus, not a gallant.",Been here forever.,Can we go?,Don't you want to get your tooth fixed?,"I don't know, I think my tooth looks fine just like this.","Well, my grandmother was missing that tooth, and she was the most beautiful woman on her oil rig.",You are an adult.,I am not your dad.,"If you want to go, we can go.",Yay.,"Thanks, Ron.","That's why you know even though you're not my dad, you're like an old brother to me.","Like a cool uncle, but old.",Like a grandpa.,But cool like a son.,Thank you very much.,Thank you.,No problem.,"That'll be $8, please.","What, you're charging us for coffee?",What kind of a business uhoh.,"Oh, hello, gentlemen.",Gotta be kidding me.,You own this place too?,"That's right, dickweed.",You wanna talk deal?,Because my prices have gone up ever so slightly since I saw you last.,"No, we're not giving in to your crazy demands.",There are plenty of other tent rental places within driving distance.,"Yeah, I'm calling Tent Emporium right now.",Tent Emporium.,"How can I help you, buttface?",What?,Come on.,Yes.,I own every tent store in Southern Indiana.,"Tent Town, Rent Ten Tents, the Tent Offensive, and Ace Tentura Tent Detective.","I also own a chickfila franchise, but that's not doing so hot right now.",Whatever.,Let's get outta here.,You've reached the Tentagon.,"How can I help you, buttface?","Okay, here's an idea.","Why don't we find something, anything, no matter how small, that we have in common?","For example, I'm an only child.",Me too.,"Although, when I was in college I found out that my dad had a second family.","Well, we were the second family, technically.","Okay, well, we both went to college.",There's that.,Yeah.,"Oh, my God!",Ann had her baby!,"Wow, this has been fun.",The bill is already paid.,May I gently suggest that you check out Chris Traeger's wonderful therapist Dr.,Richard Nygard.,Although there is a tiny part of me that always thought it was just Chris talking into a mirror.,"Anyway, maybe you should look him up.","I don't know, I read a book once that said a woman should never make the first move.",That doesn't apply to therapy.,Okay.,Good luck!,"Oliver PerkinsTraeger, meet your Aunt Leslie.",Hey!,"Oh, he's so beautiful.",And you're so beautiful.,"I mean, you're always beautiful, but right now you are the most beautiful, glowing sun goddess ever.",Why didn't you tell me you were in labor?,"Well, 'cause I knew you'd drop everything and rush here, and contractions can sometimes go for days.",Thank you.,So I didn't want you to be stuck waiting around.,"Well, I'm glad I'm here now.",Where's Chris?,"Oh, he was such a good coach that the nurses asked him to help out with a delivery down the hall.",Ow.,Ow.,Ow!,"Andrew, you need to get your tooth fixed.",No way.,I'm not going back there.,I already won all the magazine mazes.,Don't worry.,It's gonna be fine.,Ow!,"If you don't take care of the problem now, it's only gonna get worse.",Come on.,I'll drive you back.,Fine.,Let me just wolf down this peanut brittle real quick.,Why would you do that?,"Oh, right.",'Cause calories.,We're dead.,The only tent store this guy doesn't own is 300 miles away.,"Oh, hang on.",Here's a place that might work.,It's called Sweaty Roger's Pants Tent.,"Oh, no, you can't rent tents there.","Hey, guys.","Look, I was doublechecking all the paperwork that Tom gave me in that super fun parking lot, and there was something about Harvey's corporate structure that just seemed fishy.",So I dug around and it turns out he has got a lot of code violations.,Whoa!,"Larry, this is great stuff.","Never thought I would say it, but I'm a genius for making you stay outside and do a menial task.",Couldn't agree more.,"You did it, Tom.","Mm, I don't want to drive back.",I miss you so much.,No one even comes close to you as a friend.,"I even tried to rank the women at work,  but that was a total bust.",You ranked them?,"Well, I thought maybe I could use Galentine's day as an opportunity Leslie, Galentine's day?","What do you want me to do, Ann?","I need to find a replacement, and don't worry, it didn't work.",Nobody can match your ethnic hybrid energy.,Everybody brings their own unique strengths to the table.,Some that even I don't have.,You shut your mouth.,You have all the strengths.,"Look, you love harder than anyone I know.",It's tough to match.,"And I know Donna and April don't show it, but they would do anything for you.",And it's not like you and I always see eye to eye.,"I mean, Friday Night Lights?","I am more of a Riggins girl, and you lean Saracen.","Yeah, 'cause Riggins is a criminal.",He took the fall for his brother.,"Okay, he didn't watch out for his brother.","You know, I'm not having this conversation with you again.", That family is garbage., The point is we didn't always like the same stuff when we first became friends., Just don't force it., Give it some time.," I know, you're right, Ann.", Thank you.," It's just I'm missing you, and there's so much stuff I want to talk to you about."," Well, you're here now, so let's talk.", Oh., I think Oliver has more pressing business.," Okay, but we should talk soon, 'cause I almost bought a toe ring the other day."," What? Ann, you're somebody's mother.", - I know., - Okay., I'm gonna give you two some time., I'll call you from the car., I'll be out here if you need me.," Thanks for doing this, Ron."," When it's all said and done, there were a few mazes I'd cheated on."," Also, the inside of my mouth is black and hot."," So do I strip down to my underwear, or all the way naked? Hello, Diane."," I'm coming home soon to relieve you, give you a little break.", It's no trouble at all., I'm a parent., I'm always on duty.," What flavor ice cream would you and the children like? I'm getting some for a 30-year-old who works for me, so I can bring some home for you too."," Hello, Harvey.", We found a glaring number of code violations you've committed., I could see to it that you never rent another tent in this region again.," Gentlemen, I've won two online satellite Jamaican poker tournaments.", I can tell that you're bluffing.," Your Pawnee business license has lapsed, which negates most of the deals you've made this year.", I'm guessing you're pretty bad at poker., I am., And I was bluffing about winning those tournaments.," Gentlemen, clearly there's been a misunderstanding here.", I'm hoping that we can reach some kind of a compromise.," Yeah, first off, I need to know where you got these zebra-print pillows."," Second of all, I got a Tin Cup Blu-Ray itching for a Rene Russo signature.", Tom., The compromise is that you're gonna sign the deal we originally agreed upon.," We're going to let you continue renting tents, and you're going to do it at a fair price."," And Larry, he's the guy that brought you down, and he's gonna be watching you like a hawk."," Oh, hey.", I'm Larry., Great to know you., I love tent world.," God! Can you just be cool for one second? Okay, black coffee with extra grounds.", Gross., For April., And a mocha ice blended for Donna.," Guys, I totally blew it."," I was all screwed up, and I'm really sorry."," You're wonderful friends, and I love you."," We love your crazy ass too, Knope.", I think you're fine., Like a solid B-minus., Great., I'll take it.," We know you've been missing Ann, so we got you this.", Press the paw.," Hi, Leslie.", It's Ann.," I love you, and everything's gonna be okay."," It's cute, right? I'm very lucky to have you both."," You know, when Ann and I used to fight, we would make up with a five-minute hug."," Mm, you touch me and I stab the bunny."," Yeah, it's about time for my mid-morning mani, so I'm gonna head out.", Okay.," Well, that's fine."," Well, you know, we'll forge our own unique traditions in the fiery cauldron of female friendship."," I'm just an impartial bunny, but I think Ann sucks.", Also-- I'm the zodiac killer., And we might even be able to pull it off under budget., Sorry.," Sorry, you guys, I'm sorry."," I'm trying to find my inhaler, 'cause I'm having a little Take your time."," I mean, it's not like we're trying to get work done here."," Yeah, and Larry, by the way, you're looking in the wrong spot."," Your inhaler is hidden under the pile of pistachio shells on my desk, obviously."," Okay, well, that's funny, 'cause I'm terribly allergic to pistachios.", Classic.," Okay, you know what? I need to say something.", I like Larry.," He is a good friend and a fine man with an inexplicably gorgeous wife-- I mean, to the point where it makes no sense at all.", Sorry., Getting off track.," He is a nice person, and we should all stand up and say, ""I like"" Ben! No! What are you doing? Uh, he's embarrassing himself and throwing away his career."," - Sweetheart, stop."," - O, captain, my captain.", - What is happening? - Larry is my friend.," Thank you, Ben.", I mean that., Oh! Got so startled I tooted.," Come on, man.", - Oh - Gross!   ,"

cake.,"""Will you go to prom with me?",""" Well, this just keeps getting weirder.","Because of the merger, schools have had to make some cuts, and the first thing to go was the senior prom.","So as a lastminute hail Mary, the parks department is throwing prom for them.",They also wanted to cut A.,P.,"Latin, so I volunteered to teach Latin.","Which reminds me, I need to learn Latin.","I can't stop thinking about that job in Chicago, and I think this prom will be a good distraction.","In my senior year when I couldn't decide between Indiana and Amherst, I focused all my energy on planning my prom, and it was the best prom ever.","Plus, I made out with Harvey from the A.",V.,Club.,"Hmm, I think I'm jealous of Harvey.",You shouldn't be.,"A few weeks later, he almost died from a VCR electrocution.",Legend has it that he can still turn on a microwave just by blinking at it.,"The point is, will you go to the prom with me?","Well, I thought you'd never ask, because we're nearing 40.",Course I will.,Yay!,Prom!,"Okay, we are making progress, prom committee.","Now, our budget is basically zero, so we're gonna need to cover all the jobs that we would normally hire people for.","Tom, you're in charge of music.","Oh, man.","Well, all right.","Aw, did you want to DJ, little puppy?",I didn't know that little puppies could operate an iPod with their little puppy paws.,Eew and boo.,This kind of thing is getting out of hand with you two.,Y'all are on official warning.,I did DJ a little back in the day.,"I had a show called ""Zoot Suit Wyatt"" on Carleton College radio.",Tuesdays from 3:00 to 5:00 A.,M.,", I was the king of swing.",I thought we as a culture agreed to forget the year that everyone was into swing.,"Okay, Ben, you can coDJ with Tom.",Yes.,What!,No!,"If you eclipse my flavor in any way, we'll have a problem.","All right, Allison, you are in charge of choosing the prom theme, and now it has to be perfect and magical and look like a million bucks but cost zero bucks.",So what do you got?,"I was thinking the theme could be ""Fairy tale.",""" The theater department did Into the Woods last year, and we still have the scenery.",I laid out some preliminary plans in this binder.,Wow!,Are those jensetrodder color tabs?,I thought those were discontinued.,They were.,I had to order them through some Mexican back channels.,Juan Julio Oficina Supplies?,I thought they went out of business.,"They did, but they opened up a new one in Oaxaca.",What is happening right now?,"Okay, everybody get back to work.","And, Allison, come by my office later so we can keep crushing it.","All right, let's go over our set list.",Set list?,No need.,"So, what, you're just gonna put your iPod on shuffle?","No, but I could.",You want to know why?,Because every single song you own is a banger?,Every song I download has to pass a series of rigorous tests to answer one simple question: Is it a banger?,How many beats per minute?,How many drops?,How dope are the drops?,Were any acoustic instruments used?,"If so, it is not a banger.",I once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song.,I had to throw away my whole computer just to be safe.,"I feel like, to me, set list flow is very important.","I mean, we're basically vibe curators.",Ugh.,"Oh, no.","I hope that high school auditorium's big enough, 'cause I'm bringing Sometimes it's really hard to be friends with you.",Thank God we don't have to be seen together.,"Yes, we do.",We're coDJs.,Not anymore.,You're working with DJ Robo Drop.,"Badada, mm, mm, mm, mmmm  Oh, I hope that this prom is exactly like my senior prom.","Theme: ""My heart will go on.",""" Photo booth with Monica Lewinsky lookalike.",Afterparty Megan Rickerson's house.,Her parents used to let us drink as much as we wanted.,That'sthat's where we should have this afterparty.,"Or, no, we can't, because they moved to prison.","Prom is nothing but a huge party full of smiling, dancing people enjoying themselves.",It's literally my worst nightmare.,And I hate punch.,"April Ludgate, I'm gonna sing to you a song that I first wrote 15 years ago for my prom date, Sarah Weiss.","You're as hot as the sun   but you're as cold as ice   let me take you to paradise   come on, roll the dice   it will be twice as nice   Sarah WeiApril Ludgate   will you go to prom with me?",Boom!,Will you?,Fine.,"I'll go with you, because Leslie's making us, and we live together, and we only have one car right now because you laked mine.","What does ""laked"" mean?",I tried to jump it over a lake.,"Why don't you stay out of our conversations, Larry!",Will do.,"So I want to show you some very cool before and after pictures of Cherryhurst Park, one of our greatest accomplishments.",Why are you showing me all this?,Because I think you have a real knack for public service.,"We here at the parks department have something called ""The April Ludgate Summer Solstice Druid Festival and Buffalo Wings Eating Contest.",""" I don't know why I let her name it.","Basically, it's a summer internship program.",I think you'd be great.,Do you want to work here?,Definitely!,I'm totally interested.,Great.,Allison Gliffert.,"Hi, Mr.",Swanson.,You two know each other?,Is there some secret society for the greatest humans on earth?,Do you meet Tom Hanks and Elena Kagan in the Statue of Liberty's crown?,"God, this fake club I'm inventing is amazing.",Allison's father owns the hardware store I've been going to since before Allison was even born.,What brings you to the festering putrid stink hole on the armpit of freedom?,That's what he calls city hall.,"Um, Leslie was just telling me about your summer internship, and I was thinking about taking it.","Oh, no, no, no, no.",No.,I respect your father too much to let his daughter work for free for the government.,Why don't you get a paying job for the summer?,Why don't you shut your mustache?,Sorry.,You know what?,"Tim Hautner, who owns the sawmill out on Lowell Drive, is a personal friend.",He's always looking for bright young employees to give money to in exchange for honest work.,That would be awesome.,I definitely need money for school.,"Oh, really?","Is it worth a few bucks to get a million splinters in your fingers and then cut off your fingers accidentally, 'cause that will happen.",I have tolerated Leslie's progovernment ways because her annoying kindness and generosity sneakily made me like her as a person.,But I draw the line at corrupting America's youth.,I'm sure I can get Allison a job at Tim Hautner's sawmill.,I once did him a favor.,I built his sawmill.,I may be leaving this office soon.,I need to plant seeds for the next generation.,"Interns become fulltime staff, become department directors.",Circle of life.,The seasons turn.,It's really quite beautiful.,"And if Ron tries to stop me, he can eat a big ol' bowl of butts.",Hee hee!,Hah hah yeah!,Pawnee!,Class of '99!,Uhhuh!,Ooh!,"Girl, you look creepy.",Would you like a drink?,All this stuff is free.,"No, it's not.",Why'd you pay for a limo?,Because it's prom.,"If you don't show up in a limo, legally, they can't let you in.",Does your mom want to take pictures?,"Uh, yeah, she does.","Hey, hey!",Orin!,Who's Orin?,I'm April's mom.,You two look adorable.,"Ugh, just take the picture already, mom.",My baby is all grown up.,Have her home by 11:00.,"Mom, stop embarrassing me.",Say goodbye to your father.,"Bye, dad.","Good night, sir.",This is all the stuff we have to work with?,Where's everything I requested?,Where's my smoke machine?,Where's my girls dressed in Teddy Bear costumes?,Where's my Yeezus Mountain?,"Yeah, tell me about it.",I specifically requested elliptical cartridges for the turntables.,How am I supposed to keep my Husker Du albums in nearmint condish?,"Hey, I have an idea.",Why don't you throw them in the garbage?,"My prom was right after I got impeached, so I couldn't leave the house without being egged.",But my parents threw me a prom in our living room.,I think I'm still messed up from it.,I was actually only at my prom for 15 minutes.,"By the time I got my Armani suit pressed and got the little dimple on my tie just right, it was 11:45 P.",M.,"My date was pretty pissed, but, uh, I looked fly as hell.","Leslie, thanks again.",We just wouldn't have had a prom without you.,This is Aplus work.,Aplus!,"Thank you, Principal Russell.",Can I get that in writing?,"Ohho, Leslie.",You haven't changed since high school.,I can't believe he gave you an Aplus.,"Oh, did he?",I didn't even notice.,No bigs.,"Listen, Allison, I have a question for you that's very important and very serious.",Listen to me closely.,Will you help me orchestrate the balloon drop?,Ms.,"Knope, it'd be my honor.","Oh, hooray!",Allison.,Oh.,I was subcontracted by the government to construct a lighting rig.,Would like to help me screw some angle irons onto some 2x4s?,I'll give you $40.,"Yeah, sure.",I'll just be over here having fun.,See you soon!,"I know what you're doing, Ron, and I will defeat you.",Mark my words.,Stop wasting helium.,It is intended for welding and filling air ships.,I attended prom with Susan Hofler.,"Picked her up in my truck, we slowdanced to a Merle Haggard song, and then I left early to go to my shift at the quarry.",I was 12 years old.,Never went again.,Felt like I had outgrown it.,"Well, we did it.",We went to prom.,Yay!,Let's go now.,No!,What?,Are you kidding?,This is awesome.,Look around.,The bloom of youth.,Like flowers on the sunset of an eagle's poetry.,"Andy, I hate teenagers.","If you give this a chance, you're gonna love it, I promise.",It's like the movie Expendables 2.,"First time, hated it.","Second time, hated it.","Third time, it was okay.","But then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth time I watched it, I realized something.",It's justit's not good.,It's not a good movie.,"Now that I've convinced you, why don't we go dance?","Um, I'm gonna go to the girls' bathroom to check the trash cans for babies, but you can dance if you want.",Really?,I love you!,Thank you!,"Money's the motivation   money's the conversation   you on vacation   we gettin' paid so  Uh, hey, no one's really feeling this.","All right, not a 2 Chainz crowd.",I'll throw on some yeezy in a second.,Jeezy?,Weezy?,Oh!,You want some of that classic stuff.,"All right, I'll break you off some of that Ja Rule.",Who's Ja Rule?,What?,How do you wha who's what?,"The stuff you're playing is so old, it's probably trinking on grizzledump.","Hey, what's grizzledump?",And why is trinking on it bad?,"Oh, my God.",I don't know what's cool anymore.,"What's grizzledump, Ben?",What's grizzledump?,"This moment, we own it  So have you ever pulled a ceremonial cord before?",There's a little trick to it.,"You want to hold it not too tight, sort of like a firm handshake and then move towards the ground in a ropepulling motion.",So just pull the rope?,That's right.,"Thanks, Leslie, for this, and for making prom happen in the first place.","Oh, you don't have to thank me.","Working for the government is its own reward Run, Allison, run.","You're wasting your time, Leslie.",Allison and I already had a good talk about the power of the hardearned dollar.,Don't listen to him.,"Now, when you pull the rope, don't look at the balloons.",Look at the faces of the people as the balloons drop.,That's what government is about.,Look at the faces.,"No, look at the cage that is holding all of those balloons.","I assembled that cage and was paid for my labor, and I will use the money to buy shelter, fuel, and medicine.",Watch the cage.,Pull the rope.,Watch the faces.,Watch the cage.,Watch the faces!,"Uh, erm Congratulations, Ron.",You've ruined prom.,Everybody's having a terrible time.,I didn't go to my prom.,I was dating an older fella back then.,Like I'm gonna dance with a bunch of kids while he's coaching Duke to the final four.,"I just want to go home, but I feel bad because Andy's having such a good time.",Whoa!,How can I love someone when I hate everything he loves?,That's not true.,"He loves a lot of dumb stuff, but he loves you the most.","If something's bothering you, just tell him.",It's always better to be direct.,"Hey, girl.",Are you ready to go?,I feel like I told you to wait in the car.,Yeah.,See?,Be direct.,Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!,Ugh!,"You're finished, Knope.","I just spoke with Tim Hautner from the sawmill on my mobile telephone, and he's offering Allison a paying job.",She'll be assistant to the head mulcher.,Beat that.,"First of all, your telephone is ridiculous.","And second of all, I already beat it.",She's gonna take that internship.,She pulled the rope.,There's no turning back!,Leslie.,Mr.,Swanson.,May I see both of you in my office?,Now.,It has come to my attention that both of you have been harassing Allison about her summer employment decisions.,"I wouldn't say ""harassing"" so much as persistently tormenting.","I am disappointed in you, Leslie.",No!,Don't be disappointed in me.,I've never had a principal or a teacher be disappointed in me.,I'm not sure that I'm equipped to handle it.,Whatever's going on between you two and Allison ends right now.,This is supposed to be a fun event for the kids.,"You're absolutely right, and I will bow out immediately.",Thank you.,"I think the only thing that matters is whatever Apluses may or may not have been handed out, you know, are still in effect in perpetuity.","I have your word, then.",This ends now?,Absolutely.,"Attention, everyone.",Now it is time for the most magical moment of any high school prom: The announcement of the winner of the Parks and Recreation's coveted summer internship.,"Without further ado, help me congratulate Allison Gliffert!",Can we get a little music here maybe?,Probably just ruin the moment with something lame.,"Leslie, I told you.",I don't know what I'm doing this summer.,That's okay.,I know what you're doing.,You're gonna take this internship.,You're gonna fall in love with public service.,You're gonna rise through the ranks.,You'll take over Ron's job as parks director.,"You'll win a seat in congress, and then you and I will run against each other as president, but right before we find out who won, I'm gonna pat you on the back and say, ""It's your turn, kid.",""" Sorry, children.",Forget this happened.,Continue with your awkward closequarters gyrating.,"And if this is the evening you decide to have sex, use protection, please!"," Dude, if you're not gonna play anything, I'm stepping in.", Go ahead., Play whatever you want., Can't be any worse than this.," Hey, I love this song! You actually like this? Yeah, dude, it's classic rock."," Well, there's more where that came from, snoopies! Sorry.", Tried to use slang., That just came out., I only listen to CDs., It's the way music like this was meant to be heard., But it's not even auto-tuned., Where'd you get that dress? I was buried in it.," Babe, huge news.", I just got us invited to Damian Keating's barn party.," He's captain of the soccer team, and he has a fake I.",D.,", so I think he can get us all free beer.", What's wrong? There's cupcakes and music.," Why aren't you having fun? Because this prom reminds me that you had, like, a million friends in high school and everyone thought you were awesome, and I spent four years making fun of everyone and hiding mops so the janitor would think he was going insane."," If we went to high school together, we would have never started dating, which means that we would have never gotten married, and I don't like thinking about that."," Hey, maybe we wouldn't have gotten together if we were in high school.", But that's because kids in high school are idiots.," The only thing that matters is that we found each other right now, and it's the best.", You know what? Let's bail., We got that limo for three more hours., I think the extra length could help us get us over that lake., No., Let's stay., I'll have fun., I promise.," I have never told you this, but I actually have a ten-point scale for how insane you are being."," I observe your behavior, and if it's a five or below, I say nothing.", Smart., Saves a lot of time.," If it reaches a six, like for example the incident with the girls' soccer uniforms back in '05 They wrote all the team names in pink.", Nobody told them to do that., I try to steer you back to safety., A seven is when I lock you in your office until you cool down., This Allison Gliffert thing may have hit an eight., I have the police on standby., It's your move.," I'm thinking of leaving Pawnee, moving to Chicago.", I just need to make sure that the future is secure around here when I leave.," You know? Allison would become April, and then April would become me."," I mean, let's face it, Ron."," I love you, but you're hopeless without me.", Blueprints for the future are a fool's errand., They're like blueprints for a house.," Nice to have, but any foreman with half a brain doesn't need to look at them."," One day, this year or maybe the next, you're gonna be somewhere else.", So enjoy yourself now., Damn it., I just wish once you would say something stupid so I could ignore it.," Attention, please.", The votes are in.," And your Pawnee high prom king and queen areLucy Taylor and Andy Dwyer! What? I broke the box, and I threw away all the votes, and I voted for you a thousand times."," You should get on up there, King Dwyer.", Not without my queen.," Hi, Pawnee High."," As your prom king, I'm your ruler."," Silence! My first decree of power is to declare that the prom queen shall be my wife, April Ludgate, who is the best thing that's ever happened to me who came to prom even though she hates it.", Give me this., Always next year.," No, there isn't.", I'm a senior.," This is your wife? How old are you? He's 33, and I'm 47/immortal.", Get out.," High school forever! Yeah, you're having fun now.", I rigged an election and got kicked out of prom., I can get on board with that.,"  I look just like buddy holly   oh, oh, oh   and you're Mary Tyler Moore  My life is over.", I'm officially old and uncool., Might as well start wearing a plaid shirt and a tie and khakis and whatever shoes you're wearing.," Look, the fact that you don't know what high schoolers are into doesn't make you uncool.", It makes you a normal human adult.," You haven't had time to keep up 'cause the last few years, you started two different businesses.", I guess that's true., Richard Branson and Mark Cuban are too busy making deals to keep up with what the kids are into.," How else do you explain their terrible haircuts? And, hey, you may be old, but you'll never be as old as me.", Yeah., You're old as [bleep].," Thanks, Ben.", Glad I could help.,"  The show goes on all night  Allison, we wanted to apologize for acting so bananas."," You just have so much promise, we got excited.", You're a good kid.," And whatever you choose, you'll be great at it.", I have to say I admire you both.," You were right, Leslie."," Watching all those happy faces, it felt amazing.", But it was really nice to build something and get paid for it.," Ugh, Ron, she is so thoughtful and grounded."," Get her away from me, or I'm gonna kidnap her and try to mentor her to death."," Oh, let me introduce you to my boyfriend.", Greg Pikitis.," What up, Knope? Hello, Gregory.", You guys know each other? You might say that.," Come on, baby.", Let's get out of here.," That's that horrible kid who used to prank us all the time, right? Offer is off the table.", She's a terrible person with terrible judgment., Pikitis!   ,"

Sorry.",Andy.,Are you getting sick?,"It's flu season again, and I cannot get sick.",Stock up on Kleenex.,Don't touch your face.,Don't touch anything.,People are dropping like flies.,We already

McCapp is the most amazing  17yearold country singer in the entire world.,He's like Indiana's sweetheart.,We are huge Chippmunks.,That's what his fans call themselves.,I don't know why.,Chippmunks.,Because of the animal?,"No, that's too simple.",Yeah.,Okay.,"His latest song, Beautiful Like My Mom  parentheses (Support the Troops)  Has, like, two million hits on

them up, Skipp.",Ew!,This guy's the worst.,"I mean, it sucks that they didn't have ham.",But you can't treat your dad like that.,I know.,He's a monster.,But we need him.,"Your job's not that hard, okay?",Just anticipate my needs.,"Anticipating, Chipp.","Of the 25 entrants today,  only one has deemed himself worthy of a sommelier certificate.","Oh, my God.",Are you sure?,No way.,"Oh, my God.",Thank you.,"Thank you so much, everyone.",I think we can agree that all wine tastes the same.,"And if you spend more than $5 on wine,  you are very stupid.",JUDGE REINLETGO: Security.,I just want to thank all the people that got me here.,"Norbit, uh, Pluto Nash, all the Klumps.","Congratulations to the next Indiana Master Sommelier,  Xander Truffant.",I've got to go

restaurant in the area.",What do you say?,You want to work with me?,"Thank you, but I've already accepted an offer from Monsieur Montreaux.",I'll double whatever he's paying you.,"You'll pay me $500,000 a year?",I will pay you onetenth of whatever he's paying you.,Sorry.,"Aw, man, this wine bottle is all out of the wine.","Well, hello, gentlemen.",What brings you out on this fine evening?,Mother (BEEP).,Whoa.,Where'd you come from?,"Uh, that's a complicated question.",All depends on whether your conception of time is linear or circular.,What?,"Hello, Ron.",Ron.,You know this hobo?,He was my counterpart from the Eagleton Parks Department.,Dude.,Are you a ghost?,Am I?,What is happening right now?,"We know that you have that important other engagement  Yo, I gots to get that haircut.",Snip!,It's not just Pawnee that needs you.,It's the entire region.,"Permission to speak, son?",Pawnee is kind of the gateway to that whole region.,They do buy a lot of albums.,They sure ain't buying toothpaste.,Bunch of dirty hicks.,"(LAUGHS)  What if we fly me in and out same day,  so I wouldn't have to spend a night in your crap town?",Excuse me.,Pawnee is a good town.,With good people from all walks of life.,"Plus, it is an amazing place to raise kids and start a family.",You think I care about that?,Look.,I can do whatever I want.,All right?,"If I want to shoot a paintball gun at my dad, I'm going to do it.","(GROANS)  Good shot, son.",I'm proud of you.,You're crazy.,This is over.,Okay?,Pawnee does not need you.,"And you should know that, when you shook my hand earlier,  there was pee on my palms.",That makes us sound like hicks.,We're not.,Shut up.,Stupid.,Okay.,"Let's go, Andy.",You know what?,That was awesome.,You were great.,I thought you were going to punch that kid's lights out.,It was not awesome.,"I lost our headliner, I can't stop throwing up,  and Ben has not called me back yet.",I'm sorry I'm so frazzled.,There's just a lot of things going on right now.,Personal things that I can't talk to you about.,"You know, Leslie, sometimes life throws us crazy curves.","And yes, this moment may be the biggest curve  you've ever had to deal with.",But just because your family is getting bigger  does not mean that you can't handle it.,You and Ben can handle anything.,Wow.,"Andy, thank you.",That's exactly what I needed to hear right now.,"God, it's so weird that you know that I'm pregnant before Ben does.",Pregnant?,Holy crap!,Leslie!,Yeah.,What did you think?,I thought you were getting a dog.,Why did you go like this?,That's a sign for petting a dog that's sitting on your lap.,Pregnant?,Wow.,"Oh, that's amazing.","Andy, I think we need to focus on the fact that we have lost our headliner.",We are out of options.,It's time for a Hail Mary.,How are we going to convince this guy to reunite Land Ho?,Same way I got a perfect score on the SATs.,Broken Scantron machine.,"Okay, wait.","Andy, that is not a good strategy, okay?",I will give him a brief explanation about the Unity Concert.,And you stand by.,Stand by.,"Oh, God, I'm sorry.",(RETCHING)

reunite Land Ho.,"Listen, it means a lot to me that you guys loved the band.",And I'm going to tell you the exact same thing  I've told everyone who has ever asked us to reunite.,No.,"Listen, I know that you and the band  aren't on the best of terms right now.",But bringing people together is exactly  what we want to talk to you about.,Hold that.,Hold that down at the bottom.,Yeah.,Yeah.,Mr.,Ron Dunn.,I have something I'm very angry about.,"But other Ron, he's not helping me with it.",Can you help?,I can tell by the indigo on your Chiclet  that you've been drinking blueberry wine.,That's a good start.,"The Wamapoke called it ""mattapiqua.","""  They believed it had mystical powers.","Yeah, it also tastes like jelly.","So, what's got your goat there, friend?","My parents, they had this lake house  and they sold it without telling me.","And so, I was like, ""Why?",""" You know?","I was like, ""God!",You guys!,"""  Oh.","You're hanging onto that anger for dear life, compadre.",Let's role play.,"Well, goodnight, everyone.",I'm going to go home and feel totally fine.,Who am I kidding?,"I'm going to go home,  put on a Macy Gray album, and cry in the mirror!",Why are you bummed?,Are you all blind?,I want that job at Tom's Bistro.,I've been trying to show you for the last five hours.,"Look, man, you know your stuff,  but you're like a crazy volcano.",You'd have to show me you can bring it down a notch.,"I'll bring it down 1,000 notches if I have to!",This looks like it's going to be a great concert.,The band just does not play anymore.,"Well, I understand.",(COUGHS) Excuse me.,"Um, I'm sorry.",My stomach is trying to murder me.,You still drunk from last night?,I've been there.,"You know, this town still loves you.","I'm in a band myself, actually.",Mouse Rat.,And we cover about five of your songs and they just go nuts.,"  Really?

                ",Season: 6 Episode: 20,So what do we got so far?,We need bigticket items.,I got the Red Hot Chili Peppers to send us a signed guitar.,"That's great, April.",How'd you do that?,"It's a long story, but the short version is, I'm currently catfishing Anthony Kiedis.","We're throwing a charity auction to raise money for the unity concert, and we're gonna need it too, if I'm gonna perform Islands In the Stream with a Sacagawea hologram.","Plus, we need lights, generators, microphones, water, that boring stuff too.",Why don't we put a pin in this?,'Cause we have to do that thing.,"Oh, yeah.","Oh, yeah, okay.","All right, yep.","Just, like Everybody, keep working.",We'll be back.,"Andy, hey, you haven't told anyone about the baby, right?","No, but my brain is about to explode from stress.",I am not good at keeping secrets.,That's exactly what I told Kyle when he told me his wife was cheating on him.,"Andy, come on!",Ah!,See?,Oh!,"Not cool, man.","Not him, not that Kyle.","Okay, we are going to have a doctor's appointment, and then after that, we can probably tell people.","So just hang in there, please.",I can do this.,People do this.,People keep secrets.,My neighbor Eric he's kept a secret for 20 years.,He's in Witness Protection.,Okay.,You wanted to see me?,Yes.,I need to ask you for a favor.,What?,Ron Swanson asking for help?,"Keep your voice down, woman!",Part of the unity concert is a youth revue about the history of Pawnee.,"They require volunteers, so I want you to come with me to my daughters' public elementary school to help make costumes.",The elementary school.,"I'll do you this solid, but you're gonna have to keep an eye out for my exboyfriend Joe.","He teaches music at that school, and he is a nightmare.",He's my Tammy.,Your Tammy?,"Donna, my two exwives are the worst people in the world.",Tammy two once seduced a coroner and had me declared legally dead just so she could get a discount on a plane ticket.,"When I'm with Joe, he turns me into a person I don't like or recognize.",I go insane.,All I'm asking is for you to keep him away from me.,I understand this problem well and agree to this exchange of services.,"We need to raise a minimum of $30,000 from the auction, or else the concert's gonna be in trouble.",What else can we auction off?,What about those fish?,Think they're valuable?,Cover me.,Maybe you should start taking it easy.,You're stressing out for two now.,"Hmm, that's actually a pretty decent tshirt idea.","Babe, I cannot slow down.",The concert is in three weeks.,"Look, I feel fine, and if you're worried, we can just ask Dr.",Saperstein what he thinks.,"Someone say ""Saperstein""?","Come on, you two.",Let's saddle you up and put some jelly on the belly.,He's a little weird.,Mmhmm.,Look at me!,Jeez.,"Okay, here's what's happeningI want to auction off a personalized Johnny Karate song tomorrow, so I need you to come to the auction.",Auction?,"Okay, yeah.",Let me write that down.,"Andy, you already have three Johnny Karate shows tomorrow.","No, not according to my file here.","Oh, I forgot, other hand.",Crap.,"Okay, we need a better system.","Look, I'll just write down an itinerary for you, so you can just focus on songs.","Okay, well, you have to catalog all this stuff.","I mean, this is hours' worth of work.",What is that?,"""Don't tell secret""?","Oh, no, that's not one.","Andy, if you have a secret, you have to tell me.",That's the whole point of marriage.,You get twice the secrets.,"Dude, it is nothing.",I don't have anything.,I'm not acting weird.,You're acting weird.,Excuse me.,I have to get back to work now.,What are you doing?,I'm getting a picture of you volunteering at a public elementary school in case I ever need to blackmail you.,"That's Joe, 12:00.","Donna, how are you?",It's really nice to see you.,Mmhmm.,Thank you so much for helping out.,These kids are so lucky to have your fashion expertise.,"Hello, Joe.",My name is Ron Swanson.,I am Donna's workproximity associate.,"Oh, my gosh, Donna has told me so much about you.",It's nice to put a face to the name.,Mmhmm.,"Well, I gotta get back to my classroom.","It's a pleasure to meet you, Ron.","And if either of you guys need anything at all today, please do not hesitate to ask, okay?","I'm onto you, friend.",What?,Tread lightly.,Okay.,"Now, Ben wants me to slow down, but I have this huge project coming up, and slowing down isn't really my jam.","Your body is going through some changes, but you're a healthy gal, right, Leslie?",There is no reason for you not to be yourself.,I win.,It wasn't a competition.,All right.,Let's see what's going down in baby town.,There's your healthy baby.,"Oh, wow.","Oh, and there's another one.",The baby has two bodies?,Twins.,"Ben, we're having twins.","No, you're not, 'cause look who's hiding over here.",Triplets?,Triplets?,And here's a fourth.,"I'm so sorry, no.",It's a little fleck of cream cheese on the screen.,Just triplets.,"Wow, you guys really dodged a bullet.",Can you imagine raising four children at one time?,"Ha, a nightmare.",Triplets.,Triplets.,I can't believe it.,We knocked it out of the park on the first try.,"If we do this right, we can be parents to 1/3 of the supreme court!",This is insane.,This is amazing.,"I always knew we were one in a million, and now we got the proof!","Well, actually, one in 8,000.","Triplets occur a lot more frequently than you imagine,  especially at your age.",Oh.,Your body is prone to releasing multiple eggs.,It's what we doctors like to call and I don't mean to be insensitive a goingoutofbusiness sale.,"So, doctor, um, what do we like, what do we do?","Like, what do we do?","Um, how do we howhowhow how what do we do?","The first thing you do is, you forget everything that I said before because you, young lady, need a lot of rest and especially avoiding stress.","Leslie, I need you to be Buddha on quaaludes, and, Ben, you are Matthew McConaughey in a hammock on the beach.","All right, all right.",All right.,This is insane.,Three kids?,"I just multiplied all our future expenses by three, and you know what happened?",The numbers got a lot higher.,I think I heard the computer laugh at me.,And Saperstein wants us to relax?,"Are you ready to go, my gentle dove?","Oh, I will be there in two flaps of a butterfly's wing, and I love you.",We are so  screwed.,Uhoh.,"What did you do now, Joe?",Thank you so much.,We thought we were gonna have to tell Dylan that his doggie was gone forever.,"Oh, my gosh.","Barbara, don't even mention it.","Look, I hate it when my students are upset, so I just went out, driving around.",I checked a few neighborhood parks.,It took barely six hours.,"Oh, how can we ever repay you?",No need.,Would you like a muffin?,I made them last night.,It's the best muffin I've ever had.,"You're welcome, guys.",You're welcome.,Oh.,So whose birthday is it anyway?,"Oh, who knows?","I got so many kids from different women, I just get all of their birthdays out of the way one day a year.",Ladies.,"Okay, so when this ends, we have a half hour to get to the next party.",That gives us and 15 minutes for you to take a wetnap shower in the car.,"Good, I need one.","Also, tell me your secret.","Babe, don't make me tell.",I don't wanna break my promise.,Tell me now.,"Oh, jeez, this is heavy.",Pardon me.,It's about Larry.,He is very sick.,He has some kind of disease.,"Oh, so that's why you've been so nice to him and let him carry all your stuff.","Yes, that's the reason.","Good call, babe.",Jeez.,Poor guy.,"Hello,

hierarchy of the auction!,I think Leslie's doing a great job.,"Thank you, Craig.","Hey, are you doing all right?",Yeah.,You want to do some tai chi?,"No, I'm doing really fine.",Okay.,"Leslie is already the queen of stress, so I have to be like her stress shamwow.","I wrap myself around her, I soak up all of her stress, and then after the kids are born, someone can squeeze me out into a bucket.",Ron!,Ron!,"Ron, play with us!",Okay.,"Ron, play with us.","Girls, Ron's got sharp tools now.","Oh, Ron!",Ladies.,"Eyes are watching, ears are listening   lips are closed, hands are

feel very lucky to be their stepdad.,"I do, indeed.","If you'll excuse me, Joe, I have to finish hogging out the cheeks on these lap joints.","Oh, maybe you could use this jig I made.",It's just a hardwood clamping block connected to a small piece of hackberry.,You could use it to locate your cuts for the inside shoulder Without having to reset the fence.,Exactly.,Muffin?,"Thirsty there, big guy?","Well, jeez, yes.",Thank you so much.,Do you remember the time when you put sleeping pills in my soda?,I fell right over in the middle of a town hall meeting.,"Mm, no.",I don't

dog's name, so if you got a problem, take it up with Princess.","Honey, why don't you take a whalesounds break, okay?",I'll finish this up.,"Guys, come on, now.",This is signed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.,"Just think about all their great songs, covering everything from the culture of Southern California to drug use in Southern California.",I'll bid 30 bucks.,Okay.,This is easily worth $500.,Come on.,"Please, anyone.","We're just trying to raise some money for this concert,  so no one gets stressed out.",Fine.,for Old Herman.,Why would you erase the signatures?,I'm more

we're together, all we do is have sex, sit on the couch, eat homemade pasta,  have sex again.",Enough.,"He's constantly being respectful, wanting to spend time with me, trying to ""connect"" with me.",It's a nightmare.,I become boring.,"Live your life how you want, but don't confuse drama with happiness.","So I've been talking to Larry, and he's definitely not dying.","Technically, we're all dying, unless you choose the right grail.",It's the dusty one.,"Andy, I was nice to Larry.",I scratched his back.,I had a conversation with him.,It was horrible.,How can you do that to me?,Fine.,I'll tell you the secret.,Ben's dog is dying.,Lie.,Ben is dyinghe has the same disease Larry has.,Leslie is dying.,No.,They're both dying.,No.,I'm dying.,Chris and Ann are moving.,They already moved.,They're moving again to Chinatown in France.,No!,"Okay, fine.",Do you really want to know?,Yes.,Leslie is a spy.,No.,Tom has something wrong with his butt.,"Oh, my God.",What?,Did you hear that?,They need an encore.,"Honey, they wantthe kids want an encore, I'm sorry.",What song should we do?,You wanna do Toots?,"I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you.",But you're still gonna want to go to a garage 'cause I don't  I like to do things.,Excuse me.,"Museums, opera, nightclubs.",Sometimes I disappear for a day or two 'cause I'm flyfishing or I'm at a Seattle Sounders game.,I promise not to cheat on you if you promise not to try to pin me down too fast.,I have no problem with that., You can take me to dinner Friday.," I have only one request-- that you wear that, uh, red thing.", I'll wear that red thing when you deserve to see me in that red thing., Gotta go make some muffins.," Okay, there's still plenty of ways to raise money for the concert, right? Maybe we'll win the lottery."," I mean, hey, you're looking at a woman who just hit triple cherries in her uterus.", We're screwed.," No, we're not, we have three weeks until the concert.", - It'll be fine.," - No, not the concert.", The triple cherries.," I mean, of course it's the most amazing and wonderful thing to ever happen, but, okay, I am an accountant, and I am looking a cold, hard facts.", Raising three kids is going to cost $2 million.," Babe, our kids will be geniuses.", They'll get scholarships., Half of my tuition was paid for by the Indiana scholarship for pretty blondes who like to read., It's now called the Virginia Woolf prize--different time.," Leslie, I have been trying so hard not to stress you out, but we just spent our entire savings account on a trip to Paris.", What were we thinking? We spent too much money on macaroons.," Okay, honey-- Okay, wait, what's the number for the Louvre? I mean, maybe I can get a refund.", We barely looked at the Mona Lisa.," Honey, can you just breathe for a second? Leslie, these numbers are going to determine everything for the rest of our lives! - Breathe."," - I mean, maybe we should move because we could make more money, or maybe we should stay here because it's cheaper to live here than in Chicago."," Oh, my God! I'm shamwowing all of your stress, and there's no one here to wring me out."," - Benjamin Wyatt - I don't even know-- The man of my dreams, the one that I love, shh."," Leslie, we are in trouble here.", We are in real trouble! - I'm so sorry.," - What? You just look so crazy right now, but cute.", You're always stressed out., How are you calm right now? Because I realized something.," Everything that we have been through-- the harvest festival, the election, the recall, the merger, Ann leaving, Larry changing his name for some stupid reason-- all of it has just been preparation for this.", I am immune to stress because I have you., Come on., I have an idea., Ron is King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest., Much obliged., So I'm going to dinner with Joe next week., Glad to hear it., It's always nice to see someone actually change for the better.," Yes, Joe seems like a good man, but at this point, I'm done talking about him.", I was talking about you., Your family has made you a more patient and empathetic person., - You take that back.," - Come on, Swanson.", Did you think even two years ago you'd be playing matchmaker for me while wearing a glittery crown? Now you're a dad.," You care a little, itty bit about your friends.", You're King Sparkle of Cupcake Forest., It suits you.," Andy, the camo is not working.", I can see you.," - Damn, really? - Yes."," Babe, you don't have to hide from me."," I don't care about the secret anymore, okay? I just thought, when we got married, we would share everything, but if you really can't tell me or whatever, it's fine.", I trust you.," It's just that it's a really big secret, and for once, I wanted to keep my word.", But screw it., You're more important than anything., I'm gonna tell you 'cause it's super juicy-- you ready? Okay.," Everybody, if you could gather around They're here--don't try to get it out of me anymore.", The reason I have been acting so weird is not because I've been waiting for the results of the soil samples to come back.," Well, jeez, I've been up all night trying to make sure-- It doesn't matter, Larry.", It was a pointless ruse designed to waste time., The truth is I'm pregnant.," Yes, I did it! I kept a secret.", Congratulations., I'm sure you will both raise a wonderful child with whom I will profoundly disagree on nearly everything.," Well, actually, and this is crazy, but it's children, plural."," - We're having triplets, and - Shut the-- - Oh, my God! - A little freaked out about it.", That's amazing.," Babe, I am so glad you didn't tell me.", I know., I'm incredible.," Okay, now listen to me, you two."," Gayle and I have kept everything our girls ever used, so we have, like, millions of clothes and strollers and-- - just don't buy a thing, okay? - A triple crib-- sounds like an interesting woodworking challenge."," Would you like oak or pine? I'll make both, and you can choose.", My boyf-- my friend Joe has the hookup at all the good preschools.," Andy and I can babysit anytime, except for on weekends and nights, but we're free anytime during work hours."," This is gonna be the happiest time of your life! Well, I sold everything on the auction list, no thanks to you people.", What's so wonderful that you're all celebrating while I do all the hard work? We're having triplets.," Oh, great."," First my cousin Winona gets into a car accident the night my one-man show opens, and now this? Why are my accomplishments always overshadowed? Congratulations, I suppose.", That's nice of him.," - Yeah, yeah, I'll take that.", - Yeah.,   ,"
                ",Season: 6 Episode: 21,"Whoa, Alcatraz.",Can't believe Michael Bay spent a billion dollars of his own money to build that for The Rock.,I can't believe you were able to recite that entire movie from memory on the plane ride.,"You weren't trying to sleep, were you?","I couldn't tell, 'cause you had that mask thing over your eyes.",This may be the craziest week of my entire life.,I am six days away from the start of the Unity concert.,I am pregnant with triplets.,"I am trying to decide if I should take a job that will move me away from Pawnee, and I am speaking at the National Parks conference in San Francisco.",It is gonna be so much fun.,"Michelle Obama is the keynote speaker, and you know what they say, ""What happens at a national parks conference Is compiled and emailed to you in a PDF the following Monday.",""" We got to find a way to break in there.",They give tours.,Yeah.,That's exactly how they'll be expecting me to try to break in.,"My restaurant opens in six weeks, and I'm making sure I get every detail right.",This is the hardest I've worked on anything since Wow.,I've never worked hard on anything.,What a cool life!,Looks like everything's on track for July.,It's just too bad we're not opening in time for this Unity concert.,The extra publicity would've given us a nice boost.,Why don't we?,We could do a soft opening tomorrow and be ready just in time for the concert crowd.,You really think you can pull that off?,"Well, nobody can predict the future except me.","I guarantee it'll work and in six months, this place will be bigger than McDonald's.","As always, I love your enthusiasm.","See you tomorrow, partner.",A soft opening tomorrow?,"From now on, everyone call me Kristin, because I am wigging out right now!","Yeah, we're not even close to being ready.",They're not even done painting that sign.,"It says, ""Tom's Bi.",""" Actually, no, that's good.",We're ready.,Mitch is right.,The amount of buzz we get from opening next weekend is too big to pass up.,We can do it.,"""This little Italian restaurant will put McDonald's out of business"" on three.","One, two, three.",Dark Lord rise  This little Italian restaurant  will be bigger than McDonald's!,In hell fire.,"""Lester Kanopf""?","Come on, guys, get it together.",That's mine.,"Sorry, Lester.",Yours is right here.,"Grant, hi.","Yeah, I saw you were gonna be here, and since you've been ducking my calls, I just thought that I'd drop in.",Care to join me for lunch?,I I would Liam Bonneville's gonna be there.,Liam Bonneville the department of the interior's resident bad boy?,"Well, now you've got my attention.","Let me go grab my autograph book, and we'll head out.","Andy and I are meeting with a tech company called ""Gryzzl.",""" Now, they're giving away free wifi to a few cities across America, and we're going to pitch Pawnee to them.",And what exactly does Gryzzl do?,"Well, ""It's the cloud for your cloud.",""" No idea.",Wow.,"So Gryzzl's really taken off, huh?","Uh, yeah, it's been a crazy ride.","Our music service, Gryzzldump, launched in November, and now we have 170 million users.","Six months ago, I was working in a taco truck.",Now I own onethird of the Portland trail blazers.,"You know, I think Pawnee is a great candidate for your freewireless initiative.",We lead the country in online pizza ordering.,"In fact, a lot of people go to the library just to order pizza online.","Right now we're kind of focused on, like, bigger cities, like Shreveport, Akron.",Sure.,"Obviously, we're no Akron.","I mean, we're more like Dayton.","But with your help, we can become Toledo.","Ben, we don't like to say the word ""no""  No.",At this company.,"We feel it's counterproductive to our creative mission, so, instead, let me say ""Nah, bro.",""" How is that better?","Dwayne ""the Rock"" Swanson.",Donna told me I'd find you up here.,What's all this?,"Over the last few months, I've remodeled the entire third floor wiring, heating and cooling, restored this red pine back to its original glory.","Oh, wow.",The stripes are so wavy.,"It's really all right, I can't keep this facade up any longer.",I need a favor.,You know those chairs you were making for my restaurant?,I need 'em now.,I was told I had until July.,My chairs take time.,"Who do you think I am, Thomas Hucker?","Please, Ron?",I've never asked you for anything today.,All right.,I'll get to work right away.,"Please, you're really far behind.","Hello, everybody.",This is Leslie Knope.,"Leslie, this is Rebecca  Varuvian, yes, hello.",I ow who you are.,I've read all of your papers and I had your poster on my wall when I was a kid.,What poster?,I made a poster of you by blowing up your picture from the national parks newsletter.,I cut out your face and made it look like you were dunking over Charles Barkley.,My God.,"So you're the author of the famous river cleanup proposal, huh?",It wasn't bad.,Liam Bonneville read my proposal.,Wow.,"Liam's being withholding, as usual.",That proposal was brilliantly written.,Rebecca Varuvian.,Yes?,Nothing.,That was the best lunch I ever had.,I have to see the photos that you took.,I didn't take any photos.,What?,"Grant, come on.","Leslie, you're treating those people like they're your heroes.",They could be your peers.,"Look, I really hope you take the job, but we're at the end of the line here.",I need a decision by tomorrow.,"Okay, that's fair.","I mean, I would be insane not to take the job, but I'm just having some trouble thinking about leaving Pawnee.","Hey, here's someone who may be able to convince you.","Hello, Mrs.",Obama.,"Hey, Grant.",How you doing?,Oh.,Doing good.,This is Leslie Knope.,She's considering a job with us running the new Midwest Bureau in Chicago.,"Well, you know how I feel about Chicago.","Ah, you are from Chicago, so you like it!","That's right, and we need passionate people like you on our national parks.","You know, they get hundreds of millions of visitors each year.",Are you nodding because you agree with me?,"Yes, I do agree with you.","I agree with you on all things throughout history until the end of time, forever.",You and Grant work together?,"Yeah, we work together a lot.","He's helped me integrate the ""Let's Move"" program into our national parks you know, getting kids outside, rock climbing, hiking.",Wow!,"That's really, really incredible!",Great work!,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!,"I'm getting louder now, and I can't stop!",My apologies!,Just I don't know.,I'm sorry I'm talking so loud!,Just can I highfive you?,Yeah.,Well I hope you take the job.,Change happens one person at a time.,Good to meet you.,"Again, think it over.","Okay, this is a bad idea.",Just trust me.,You got your camera ready?,"Yeah, Andy, I'm very nervous about this.",You're gonna hurt yourself.,And here we go.,Wow!,Look at it go!,"I mean, I knew it'd go down, but not that fast!",Ohho!,San Francisco's the best.,Huh.,I thought he was go.,Yeah.,Anyway I've decided.,I'm gonna take the job.,"There's so much more in the world to see, and I feel like I can really make a difference.","Oh, and I met Michelle Obama.",What?,Why didn't you lead with that?,I don't know!,Liam Boneville has me in a tizzy.,Guys!,It's totally broken!,We have ten tables booked for the soft opening.,"It's all friends and family, so hopefully they'll go easy on us.","How's it looking, Ron?",Maybe speed it up a little?,This is not government work.,"As such, I treat it with care and attention.","Okay, but also, go faster.","I haven't had time to hire a staff yet, so, April, you'll handle service.",No!,Can't I just stay in the back and spit in people's food like we planned?,Ugh!,The sawdust from Ron's chairs is everywhere!,"My sinuses are on the Fritz, and smell is 90% of taste, maybe 95%!","Okay, Craig, Donna's gonna be your wine taster.",You guys will work as a team.,"Fine, but if he raises his voice once once I'm out.",Please don't stick to that policy.,I got the menus.,Great.,"Larry, what the hell?",What are these pictures?,"Aw, jeez, I must have given the printer the wrong flash drive.","What is this, a rotten grapefruit?","No, it's my dog's rectum.","Lord Sheldon has a growth, so we're sending pictures over to the vet.","But I guess this isn't good for menus, is it?","Larry, Larry, Larry, listen to me.",This is the worst thing you've ever done.,I need you to take all of these dogbutt pictures and burn them in the pizza oven.,"April, you list all the menu items from memory.",It'll be classier anyway.,Ron!,What was wrong with that one?,It was too perfect.,It looked machinemade.,"Okay, we have to convince 'em that Pawnee is a special city.","Ooh, we could tell 'em that there's buried treasure in Pawnee.","And then after they give us the free wifi, we tell 'em that the treasure was love all along.",No.,"I am not gonna take ""no"" for an answer.","If we're leaving Pawnee, I'm gonna give 'em a goingaway present free wifi for all.","Every time someone in Pawnee clicks through a slideshow of American music award redcarpet sideboob fails, they'll say, ""Thank you, Ben Wyatt.",""" What the hell?",They're playing Cones of Dunshire.,"Hey, you invented that game.",Are they playing any games I invented?,Are they throwing dirt into a fan?,"The key is, you have to throw the dirt  into the back of the fan.",How the hell did they Excuse me.,How did you guys get your hands on this game?,Someone sent it to us.,Have you played it?,I invented Cones of Dunshire.,You're the architect.,"Yeah, right, and I'm the Alchemist of the Hinterlands.",There can't be an Alchemist of the Hinterlands.,The Hinterlands is a Shadongdom that can only sustain a provost or a denier.,He's right.,"Hey, how about this?",Let's play.,"If I win, you give me another shot at free wireless for Pawnee.",Have a seat.,You want to be corporal  or warrior?,Neither.,I'm the Maverick.,By using the Leslie Knope seamless merger supesystem patent pending Pawnee and Eagleton and their parks departments will be fully integrated within the next 6 to 12 months.,"I know, I know.",I think it was a good presentation too.,Is that why you're laughing?,Your timeline is way off.,I was in charge of the Wesham/Southborough merger of 2004.,You know when it was completed?,Last month.,What?,How is that possible?,Merging governments requires constant handson management.,You're being very cavalier about the future of your town.,Excuse me.,"I've been accused of lot of things, but cavalier has never been one of them.",I have a super system.,"I had a system too, but the economy went South.",My hometown hit some hard times and was converted into unincorporated territory.,You lost your cityhood?,"If you want to see this through, you need eight to ten years minimum, unless you want to run the risk of Pawnee becoming  Don't say it.",Unincorporated territory.,"It's a bold flavor fruity, a little earthy.","Well, which is it fruity or earthy?",It can't be both.,They're mutually exclusive!,"Oh, no!",You do not come at me like that.,I'm sorry.,I don't know who I am anymore.,A man without a palate isn't a man.,"I love you, Donna.",What are you guys doing?,There's people waiting out there!,"We're having a moment, you monster!",Ugh!,Stop hassling me.,"Ron, you're amazing.","You've always been like a grandpa to me, but can you please lower your standards a tiny bit so my customers have somewhere to sit?",No.,Oh!,"I am so sorry, Tom.","I can't believe I'm saying this, but don't worry about it.",Restaurant superstition breaking a glass on the first night is good luck.,"Oh, thank God.","Oh, jeez.","Play an action card, build a bell tower inside your citadel.",My shaman casts a toyber spell on your prosperity tile.,Looks like someone's out of resource gems.,Uhoh.,What's so funny?,"Oh, no, no, no, you're a smart guy, clearly picked up some flashy tricks, but you made one crucial mistake.",You forgot about the essence of the game.,It's about the Cones.,"Move my abbot to the ocean hex, which moves my Brinksman to the Devil's Lair, and pushes my farmer yes, my humble farmer directly into the central cone.","Yeah, babe, we did it.",This whole company is ours.,"Oh, no, it's not.","That's mine, it's all mine.","Andy for the record, I did invent this game.","But it doesn't even matter, because I won and I get another chance to prove that there's something truly special about Pawnee.","Yes, there is.",It's the home of the architect.,Let's talk.,I'm on top of the world.,"Andy, what are you doing?",Seems like things are a little chaotic.,"No, no, everything is perfect.",This is April.,She's gonna be taking care of you tonight.,"Hello, welcome to Tommy's Bistro.","Today we have spaghetti, linguini, butercini, ravioli, rigattoni, lasagna.",Could you repeat that?,"Spaghetti, linguini, butercini, ravioli, Ferrari, Lamborghini, rigattoni, lasagna.",Can I see a menu?,We had to throw our menus away because they are covered with pictures of Larry's dog rectum.,Great news.,Lord Sheldon's gonna make it.,"Yeah, just have to apply a salve to his anus every hour for the rest of his life, but Oh, enjoy your meal.",For crying out loud!,"No, Mitch, don't leave.",Come on.,You have no idea how to run a restaurant.,I've been in this game before and I can see the cracks starting to form.,"Sorry, kid, consider my investment terminated.","D, let's go.","Sir, were you sitting in that chair?","Yes, yes I was.",Why?,No reason.,Let's go!,"Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread.","I mean, it's all over the Internet Austin, Charlotte, San Diego.","I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe.",That's great.,I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.,"Oh, I'll look into that, but at least because of it, Pawnee will get free wireless, and we can both move away with a clear conscience.",Uhoh.,What's wrong?,I I can't leave Pawnee during a difficult merger that I'm responsible for.,I have to turn down the job.,"Leslie, no.",You made up your mind yesterday.,You Michelle Obama.,"I know, but I've been doing this for months.",The only thing that I am 100% positive on is that I want to stay and go.,I'm never gonna be able to decide.,"I'm gonna be paralyzed by hypotheticals until I die here, in this minivan at the San Francisco airport.",Wait a second.,I have an idea.,Drive here.,So you screwed up a little.,"You tried to shoot the moon, and you came up short.",That doesn't mean it's over.,My main investor pulled out.,Any dollar I spend from now on is my own.,"And despite what my pocket square says, I'm not a billionaire.",So I quit.,"Just go home, Ron.",I'm not done with the chairs yet.,It is my belief that you never start a job you don't intend to finish.,Really?,I love quitting.,"When I was a kid and things didn't go my way, I would just take my ball and go home.","That's better than winning, 'cause then your friends can't play anymore.",Hey!,"No, my stemware!",You are not quitting.,"I just called a bunch of reviewers, and I told them that the soft opening went great, and I invited them to come here on Friday.",Why would you do this to me?,You worked really hard.,"You owe it to yourself to give it a real shot, because you are smart and talented.","Well, I hate doing work, but I love being flattered, so maybe I'll give it another try.",Good.,"It's a smart move, son.","Thanks, Ron.","Because you currently owe me $16,000 for the wood.",What?,Where are we going?,"Oh, it's right up here.",Just trust me.,I'm on Endor.,These are the redwoods George Lucas used to create the forest moon of Endor.,Sorry.,That's not why we're here.,"Well, that is a gorgeous view.","Yes, it is.",But don't look at that.,Look at this.,You've been thinking about this job in the abstract.,Focus on what it actually means.,We're standing in a national park that stretches 50 miles.,That's the Presidio over there.,It's a national park.,"So is Alcatraz, and so are the redwoods we just walked through, by the way.","You take this job, places like this will be your office.","Well, that is a compelling point.","When we got back from London, you said that it's a very big world and you've seen very little of it.","This is your chance, honey.","This whole region Mount Rushmore, the Badlands, the Ozarks, Abe Lincoln's childhood home you would be in charge of all of it.",Your job would be to preserve the most beautiful places on earth so millions of people could enjoy them.,"And those places, the greatest treasures America has to offer, will all have signs with your name right there.","Hi, Grant.",I want the job.,"I have a lot of questions, but I'm a little amped up right now, so I'll probably just hang up.",It might be for the best.,"But, anyway, I love you.","No, I don't.",I'm sorry.,That was weird.,"Okay, bye.","Oh, this is Lester Kanopf.","No, you know who it  Okay, bye.","Smoothly handled, Lester.",I panicked.,We should go.,"We have a lot of stuff to do and the meter's still running on that cab, so chopchop.",Really?,Yeah.,Oh.,The opening of Tom's Bistro was a disaster.,So what?,This is America.,"And America's the land of second chances, and now we have one night, one afterparty to make the world realize that Tom's Bistro is where miracles can happen!","Thomas, I have to work all day at the Unity concert.","If you're gonna pull this off, we need more people.","I know, and I didn't want to do this, but I called in some reinforcements.",Did someone call for a party zoo?,"Yum, yum, yum, yum.","All right, so we got a fourway going with my ex, my brother, and this rando?","Okay, if that's where the night is going  It's 9:00 in the morning  Wha It's not a fourway.",And I need your help.,Take these V.,I.,P.,invitations.,"Find all the ""A"" list peeps at the concert and get 'em to the restaurant tonight.",I got to stop by the Parks office.,I'll meet you later.,Godspeed.,"I like your energy, hombre.",What do you say you and I ride gokarts later?,I want to go horseback riding!,Deal.,"Last chance, Ron.","The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister Duke Silver wanted to come out.","Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun.","Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times.","Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting.","Andy, you are in charge.",This is your show.,Take it away.,"Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept the following missions.",Madison.,Manning that art tents.,Donna.,Scheduling and security liaison.,Larry.,Staying out of the way.,And all of the rest of the volunteerwork assignments are up on this board.,"Your main goal today is to get 2,000 people to sign up for the PawneeEagleton merger preservation volunteer action squad.",Their first project will be to come up with a shorter name for the group.,You're right.,The name is too long.,I was picturing bigger hats.,"All right, here we go.","Everybody, let's get to work.",Can the Parks and Rec people hang back for a second?,"Um The reason I wanted you guys to stick around is, I wanted to tell you  That I love and admire you.",Oh!,"Leslie, thank you.",You say that every morning.,"A while ago, I was offered a job at the national parks service, and it's a great opportunity, but it means that I'll have to move to Illinois.",And I took the job.,Good for you!,Wow!,That's great!,"Congratulations, Knope.",The sentimental people in this office will probably miss you.,When do you leave?,"Soon, maybe a month.",Oh.,That makes what we're about to show you a little bit awkward.,We had a new founders day statue commissioned and added your name to the list of founders of Pawnee.,Because you basically founded this new town.,"Leslie Knope, champion of the PawneeEagleton merger, ""our most faithful citizen.",She never abandoned us.,"""  Oh, boy.",There's a quote too.,"""'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.","' Leslie Knope, multiple occasions.",""" I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.","This is so touching, you guys.",I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.,"Leslie, don't cry.",It's not that great.,It doesn't even look like you.,"Or, actually, you know what?",It kind of does.,"Well, it's about that time.",Unity concert!,"Hello, Pawnee.",We're The Decembrists.,It's great to be here in support of this event.,This is truly an amazing town.,"I ordered a small cheeseburger, and both the buns were pizzas.","each feather   it fell from skin  Joanie baby, I'm throwing a huge party tonight at Tom's Bistro.",You gots to stop by.,You gots to stop by.,Will this medium drink of water be there?,The only reason I wouldn't be there is if I got pulled over  For violating my house arrest  Ahboosh!,What?,"Judge gave me two ankle bracelets, said it was the first time he ever had to do that.","Uh, jah boy's a question on the bar exam.",Yahhey!,"Anyway, Tom's Bistro, tonight, be there.",Uhoh.,Okay.,"Don't just let me talk Well, the relocation package seems fair, but the dental plan is more than fair.","I mean, three annual cleanings for the spouse?",Kaching.,"Hey, did someone say ""dental plan""?",How's it going?,"Councilman Jeremy Jamm, Jamm orthodontics.","Hey, uh, I think we can all agree this concert blows, right?","You guys really want to see a crowd, you might want to stop by my secession rally later tonight.",That is gonna be off the hook!,You ever heard of warrant?,Yeah.,"There's a cover band around here they call themselves ""Cherry Pie.",""" Pretty sure we got their bass player.","Oh, wow.",Gonna be pretty good.,"Dahnahnah, rock and roll, yeah, poison  What is that?","Just general rock, man.",It's gonna be fun.,"She's my cherry pie, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah   that guy was a councilman?","Crazy, right?","Okay, uh, let's talk staff.","For the first few months, you're only gonna have six staffers.",Four of them will be coming up from Omaha.,"Oh, so does that mean that there's two openings left?",Yeah.,Because I happen to know some of the most dedicated civil servants and greatest people to ever walk the planet earth.,You can hire whoever you like.,"I will hang my head   hang my head   low, low, low  Ginuwine, it is an honor to be breathing the same air as you.",No joke.,But real talk we're both men about town being constantly bombarded with party invitations.,Who is this guy?,"My friend who's opening a restaurant tonight, and you're going to be there, cousin, unless you want me to get onstage and talk about how we used to take baths together, how you cried whenever I took away your rubber duckies.","Damn, Donna.",Why you got to bring the Quackson 5 into this?,How y'all doing?,"Li'l Sebastian, this one is for you, because you're my pony.","I'm just a bachelor   I'm looking for a partner   someone who knows how to ride  Ron, I have to ask you something, and I want you to consider it, okay?",Really consider it.,How would you feel about leaving Pawnee and moving to Chicago?,"Hold on, come on, I'm not done.",You'd be working for the federal government.,"You know what, excuse me for wanting my dear friend and ethical mentor to accompany me on the adventure of a lifetime.","It's very sweet, Leslie, and the national parks service is probably the only branch of government worth a damn, but Diane and I are quite happy raising our family here.","Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a booth over there serving something called, ""fried sausage quilts,"" so I'm going to buy the booth.",Just once if I had the chance  Hello.,I'm Johnny Karate.,"Imaginary friends are cool   imaginary friends take the fall for you   Daddy, you should play music.","Yeah, Ron.",Go on.,Get up there.,Have some fun.,I recalibrated the sights on all the rifles in the shooting gallery.,I've had enough fun for one day.,"Oh, I know that look.",Where is she?,She's near.,Hide the children.,"Hello, Ron.","Hello, Ron's friend.","Tammy, what could possibly bring you to a children's performance preparing a ritual sacrifice of a newborn?","No, just trolling for some daddy.","Oh, sorry.",I pronounced that wrong.,"Trolling for some dad ""D.",""" Diane, why don't you take the girls for some ice cream while I dispose of this sewerdwelling gutter witch?","Bye, Tammy.",Always a pleasure.,"You're not fooling me, Ron.",This little domestic charade of yours hasn't changed you one bit.,"You're still the same old Ron Swanson, and I will defeat you.",I will defeat you right into my pants.,Thank you!,Everybody go crazy!,"All right, thanks, guys.",Remember karate on bad guys only.,"Hey, man, you were really great out there.","Oh, hey, burly.","How you doing, man?","Pretty good, man.","Remember my nephew, Jack?",He's a really big fan.,"Whoa, hey, Jack.","Good to see you, bud.","Hey, listen, man, I'm really sorry things ended so weird with mouse rat.","You know, that's not really how I pictured us  breaking up, you know.","Yeah, I do know.","I always figured we'd you know, whatever break up 'cause I got drafted by the Colts.","And then in the first game, of course, I'd break my leg.","Crowd starts chanting my name, and I give 'em the thumbsup.",And then I'd go to the hospital.,I'd get really good at chess.,"I end up beating the computer finally, and then the band just sort of drifts apart.","That was how I saw it, but  Yeah.",Take it easy.,"Yeah, see you.","Babe, that was so awesome.",That was the best performance ever.,One kid peed his pants because he didn't want to miss anything.,What?,I gave a kid pee pants?,Yes!,"Well, that's why I do what I do.",What's wrong?,I guess I just kind of miss having people up onstage with me.,They never tell you when you go solo that it's just gonna be you up there.,"Anyways, what do you say I take you over to the ball pit, and we find your cell phone I lost?",You what?,"Just living on a Sunday morning   got my toast and tea, and I'm warm and   I just thought I'd think about   and it might be   the comfort of a knowledge of a rise above the sky   could never parallel the challenge of an acquion   in the here and now, here and now  I love you, Kay Hanley!","I hope you like deepdish pizza, because there's gonna be a lot more of it in Chicago, where we're all gonna be moving.",Okay.,No.,No.,"We are not moving to Chicago for, like, a billion reasons.","But, babe, pizza.",There's pizza in Pawnee.,Right.,"Thanks, babe.",You're so good at reminding me where pizza is.,"Come on, guys, take a risk.",Live on the edge.,Life is an adventure.,It is!,Let's do it!,No.,No.,"Pawnee is cheap, and we like it here, and Chicago seems like there's a lot of stuff to do and people, but I like to do nothing with no one.","So thank you, and I love you, but, no, thank you, and I hate you.",I love you.,"Well, you know, you owe me for that pizza.",But you're motoring   Yeah   motoring  Sister Christian.,"Thank you, Pawnee!",We have been Bobby Knight Ranger!,Super cool to hear Sister Christian that many times in a row.,Now is the moment we've all been waiting for.,"This next band agreed to reunite for one night only, and it's gonna be great.",I personally hope that they play Summer Sun.,"We all know how it goes, right?","Summer sun   summer sun   Hey, Andy.","* Summer * Why don't you let us play those, bud?","Oh, yeah, good point.",Okay.,"Without any further ado, land ho!","What up, Pawnee?","alone and zoned and sad   no one gives a zig or zag   I should have let you ride   I should have let you go  Thank you, Pawnee!",You miss the band?,"No, I mean, I love that I'm Johnny Karate now, but being part of a band, that's just that's rock and roll, man.","Joining us now for our finale, legendary local band, please welcome Mouse Rat!",You guys are closing this sucker down!,"Well, how about this Unity concert, huh, Pawnee?","I love this town so much, and I'm just so proud to live here.",And we're gonna close tonight out with a tribute to Pawnee's greatest treasure.,"Up in horsey heaven, here's the thing   You trade your legs for angel's wings   and once we've all said goodbye   you take a running leap, and you learn to fly   byebye, Li'l Sebastian   I miss you in the saddest fashion  Whoo!","byebye, Li'l Sebastian   you're 5,000 candles in the wind  Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.",Duke Ssilver!,"byebye, Li'l Sebastian   I miss you in the saddest fashion   byebye, Li'l Sebastian   you're 5,000 candles in the wind  Guys, this is the most important night of my life, which means it's the most important night of your lives too.",Speak for yourself.,I once got into a cab that Kyra Sedgwick was getting out of.,"No way, The Closer?",Oof!, It's opening night.," Let's do this! Hey, butt wieners!  Look who I found  - Daddy! - No.", Your father ruined my last business., Why would you bring him here? Because you told me to look for V.,I.,P.,"s, and my daddy is the V.",I.,"-est ""P"" I know."," - I love you, daddy."," - I love you too, angel."," Money, please."," - Mm! Money! Money! Money! - Money, please! Craig, we're gonna drink."," Why would you come here, Saperstein? I came here to see your flourishing business, to see how well you're doing.", Wow! You're back.," Can you squeeze me in, or do I need a reservation? 'Cause there's nobody here.", Maybe this restaurant won't be a huge success., Maybe it won't be packed with celebrities., - Tommy! - Or maybe it will.," - Hello, Joan."," Hello, Perd.", - Hi., Thanks for coming by., - Can I get you a drink? - I'll have the Joan.," It's a tumbler of gin, and it's got crushed aspirin around the rim.", And I would just like an empty glass.," Steve, can we get these cocktails going for Joan and Perd? Oh, look, Kay Hanley, rock star, thanks for coming by.", Thanks for having me.," Come on in, guys."," You might want to grab a seat, Dr.", Saperstein., Looks like it's getting a little crowded.," And I said, ""you don't need a towel.", You need a washcloth.,""" You know, I don't think that the girls have ever been happier or more surprised than when you got up on that stage."," Well, having you and the kids in my life has made me a different person.", And I like it., There's more room in my life for fun.," Hi, Ben."," It's me, Barney, from the accounting firm.", Yes.," Hi, Barney.", You don't have to introduce yourself every time.," I was gonna wait until your birthday to give this to you, but I'm just too excited.", This is the copyright to Cones of Dunshire.," After you gave it to us as a gift, we saw its potential, so we formed a ""C"" corp and registered it in your name.", This is amazing., How can I ever repay you? Come work for us at the accounting firm., Okay.," Oh!  Oh! No, sorry.", I can't., Wow., Shortest one yet., Thank you.," Babe, thank you so much for organizing the mouse rat reunion.", It was actually Ginuwine who arranged everything., He really cares about you., You're the greatest wife ever., I wish I could marry you all over again., Let's get divorced.," That way, we can get married again."," Yes, let's do it."," - You want to? - Yes! We should do that, right? Yeah, totally.", - We're getting divorced! - Yes., This is amazing.," Practically everyone we invited came, except for Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus.", I was hoping tonight would be magical enough - to get 'em back together.," - Let it go, friend."," He's not good enough for her, and vice versa! Thomas."," Yes, we don't get along, but I look at you I see driven, I see smart, and I just had the best Italian meal I've ever had in my life, and I've been to Dallas.", - I'm in., - No way., I'm not gonna let you take another one of my businesses.," No, no, I'm in as a partner.", I'm always looking for new investments., I've got an auto dealership.," I've got a massage parlor, a dry-cleaning transactional holding company that is doing unbelievably well, I might add."," What do you say? You know what? I'm not really looking for investors, given the almost embarrassing level of success I've attained, but I'll consider it."," Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get some pictures for my wall of fame."," Uh, excuse me, miss Hanley? Do you mind if I snap a you-ie? It's what I call selfies of other people.", Sure.," Can I get everyone's attention, please? Our goal was to get 2,000 signatures in support of the merger."," We got almost 4,000 on the first night."," Hey, everybody, let's keep this party going.", The next round of gnocchi is on the house.," You look sad, Knope.", Couldn't find any takers for Chicago? Everybody turned me down but Larry., - Ouch., - Yeah.," Well, cheer up."," You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like."," Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee."," I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here."," And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner? You will not, no."," I know it's not easy to leave, but this job does seem perfect."," Of course, I'd prefer you use your talents elsewhere."," You know, with your courage and small frame, you'd make an excellent coal miner."," Thank you, Ron.", That's very sweet., It's time for you to move up in the world.," Your ambition was bound to take you away from the town you love sooner or later, and you can't have everything you want."," Oh, my God.", I can have everything I want! - Thank you., - I feel like - you're not listening to me.," - Oh, and by the way, don't think that we are not discussing Duke silver."," When were you going to tell me about that? Unbelievable! I am so furious at you, but I've already forgiven you, and you need to teach me how to play the saxophone."," Okay, bye."," Hi, Leslie and everyone.", - I'm Grant - No time for small talk., I think the best version of me working as Midwest regional director is not in Chicago., It's right here in Pawnee., - How so? - The financial savings here are enormous.," I mean, the cost of living is way lower here, and renting the entire third floor of this building would be way cheaper than a much smaller space in Chicago."," Pawnee is actually closer to most of the parks in the Midwest region, and it's got Tom's Bistro an exciting new-wave Italian eatery that's equal parts Dean Martin and Bruno Mars.", But that's just what The Indianapolis Star is saying., Let's see what everyone else has to say.," No, no, this is not what we're doing right now.", - But congrats., - Leslie should stay here.," And if you don't agree with us, it's nine against one, and we can make you disappear forever."," - What? - I said, ""We have free wi-fi.",""" Look, Pawnee is a town on the rise, and national parks could get in on the ground floor."," It's the best option, hands down."," Well, I'll run this up the flagpole."," Also, can you bring back Power Rangers? I don't know what it is you do, but you seem important enough to get that done.", Sometimes you have to make the hardest climb to see the most beautiful sunrise., I read that once on an old lady's decorative pillow., But it is really how I feel today.," I've climbed a very weird and rocky mountain, and it was a pain in the ass, and my legs are tired, and I'm starving, but the sun is rising over a sea of love and waffles and possibility.", So I'm just gonna relax and take a deep breath and enjoy this view for as long as I possibly can.," Call Ken and Rebecca, and no statements to the press unless I personally release them.", We are on a media lockdown.," Where is Ed with the file? Ed! I'm sorry, Miss Knope, I lost the file.", - It's gone.," - Ed, you're a nice guy, but you're the most incompetent person I've ever word with, and that includes Terry."," Jeez! Get it together, Terry.", Clean out your desk., You're fired., I understand., Thank you for the literally hundreds of opportunities you've given me.," Good-bye, everyone.", It's been a great three years., Cancel my flight to South Dakota., We'll do it next month.," - Babe, what's our play here? - Everyone's waiting downstairs in my office.", Let's just go hear what they have to say.," But honey, tonight's your big night."," No, this is more important.", Where are the kids? - Right here.," - Hey, guys! Mommy and daddy had to do a little work, and you're gonna have a fun play date with Uncle Andy - and Aunty April, okay? - Let's go, munchkins."," I forgot, Ben how many bags of marshmallows do I give them? None! Just let April do everything."," One day, in the distant future, things will be calm and normal, right? Probably not.", But that's okay., - You ready? - Not at all., But that's never stopped us before.,   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 01,"I mean, there were rumors that they were gonna announce it next month.",But they must've gotten impatient.,Okay.,"Whatever they say, we need to come up with 10,000 possible responses to 10,000 possible scenarios.",Okay.,"Just to remind you, I don't work for the National Park Service.","Yeah, yeah.",How are those scenarios coming?,"Okay, look, before we go in there, you need to know something.",He's here.,Who's here?,The guy whose name you forbid me from saying out loud because it fills you with rage.,"Look, I don't know who he's working for, but I guess he's part of one of the bidding groups.",Are you gonna be able to be civil in there?,I'm perfectly civil.,He's the stupid garbage head doodoo face.,Perfect.,Thank you all for coming.,"I'm Trevor Nelsson, legal counsel to the Newport family.","The Newport Family Trust intends to sell a 25 square mile parcel of pristine, undeveloped land containing Lake Eagleton and the Southern Indiana Foothills.",Why now?,The Newports have owned this land for 100 years.,"Thanks to the recent economic boom in Pawnee, real estate prices are at an alltime high.","And in the words of Jessica Wicks Newport, heir to the entire Newport fortune, quote, ""It's time to trade those dumb old trees for a buttload of cash.",""" It is.",It truly is.,"This land is begging to be a new national park, and it's in my own backyard!",This could be my crowning achievement.,I could retire.,"I mean, I wouldn't.",I'm gonna work until I'm 100 and then cut back to four days a week.,"Oh, God.",I'm already so bored thinking about that one day off.,Maybe I'll go to law school or something.,"We will select the finalists from a set of initial, sealed bids due at 5:00 p.",m.,Tomorrow.,Good luck.,Okay.,Oh.,Cool.,There he is.,What?,He's here?,He is coming over.,I don't want to talk to him.,I should hide.,No.,He should hide.,He should run.,He should run away.,He should hide his stupid face.,"He shouldn't be Hello, Miss Knope.","Hello, former strange person I used to friend.",You're looking very Ronlike.,You have your same hair.,"No, I don't!",I have bangs now!,"I've never known what bangs are, and I don't intend to learn!","Well, maybe you should!",I left the Parks Department two years ago.,"Now I work in the private sector, running my own building and development company.",It's called Very Good Building and Development Company.,I wanted to convey the quality of our work without seeming flashy.,So your company is involved with one of the bidders?,"Hell yeah, pimp!",He's on Team Gryzzl now.,We hired his company to help plan and build our new Gryzzl campus.,Right here in town on that land.,"Oh, my gosh.",It's perfect.,The trees and rocks and the sky.,Yes.,The land has good sky.,"This guy, he's so far out.",So normcore.,You know that the National Park System deserves this land.,Why are you trying to screw me?,This is like Morningstar all over again!,This is nothing like Morningstar.,And that was two years ago.,"Well, you don't know who you're dealing with.","I directly oversee 1,200 people.",I have a staff of creative geniuses that will not stop working until we win this bid!,Leslie!,"I couldn't find that file you wanted, but I did find a file called Bird Census 1980.",And it's empty.,"Get out of here, Ed!",I fired you.,Right.,"If anybody wants to hang, I will be at Subway.",He's very stupid.,"Babe, I just dropped off Leslie's triplets with her mom.",All three of 'em.,Nailed it.,Look what she gave us.,Slow cooker!,Great.,Yeah.,So hurry up and get ready.,The gala starts in an hour.,"And don't forget, tomorrow we have to go to that guy's office to sign the renters insurance forms.",Get ready.,Go.,Everything is going great.,April's kicking ass at her National Parks job.,"I work there part time, and I have my own TV

no.",Ninjas attack!,Andy.,No.,That's my crotch.,"Okay, guys.",Three more kicks apiece.,"Jessica, hi!",I'm glad I caught you before you left.,"Just between you and me, what do you think your land might sell for tomorrow?",Trevor says it'll probably be around $90 million.,"Oh, wow!",I know!,I am just I am so happy for me!,Would you ever consider giving the federal government a discount?,For a very good cause?,A National Park?,"Oh, Leslie, I have always liked you.","Yeah, no, you haven't though.",But I also like money.,And money pays for my lifestyle.,Leslie doesn't pay for my lifestyle.,Money does.,"So, between money and Leslie You see the bind that I'm in.",Yeah.,It's a tough one.,"Well, thank you, Jessica.",You did and said exactly what I thought you were gonna do and say.,And that's oddly comforting.,"Thank you, sweetie!",Who is Tom Haverford?,"He's a mentor, a lover, a hero.",But who is my hero?,Simple.,It's me five years from now.,"Okay, I really only need a correct spelling of your last name.",You are looking at one of Indiana Business Monthly's 35 under 35.,"I own Pawnee's hottest restaurant, two fast casual eateries, and the Tommy Chopper.",We serve chopped salads out of a decommissioned military helicopter.,I'm a mogul now!,"Hey, Tom.",Ben Wyatt!,City Manager of Pawnee.,The Chamber of Commerce asked me to introduce him at a very fancy black tie gala tonight.,"One of the many area bigwigs who comes to me for life advice, fashion tips You get it.",Write this all down.,"So, for the introduction, I'd love it if you could just keep it brief.",Like stick to my fiscal accomplishments.,"Wanna wake me up when you're done boring us to death, am I right, Janet?",Write down that I'm funny.,Benji.,Relax.,Come on.,When's Tommy ever let you down?,Constantly.,I'm being honored at a gala tonight because I'm in charge of the Pawnee Bicentennial Celebration.,"It's my biggest project since Ice Town, so it really means a lot that I'm being recognized as a city leader instead of being yelled at and pelted with things.",Wait.,"You don't think this is all an elaborate setup to pelt me with things, do you?","It takes, like, eight hours to cook something in this thing.",I guess I could pick up a brisket tomorrow and start it for dinner Thursday.,Thursday's no good.,I have production meetings all day.,I think we've got dinner with Joe and Donna on Friday.,"Hey, you know, Sunday, we can go to the farmer's market, put the brisket in the slow cooker, get a movie on Pay Per View.",The new Jason Bourne movie is supposed to be pretty funny.,"Andy, we're planning our whole week, like old people!",We used to be spontaneous and weird.,We used to eat cereal out of Frisbees because we didn't have any bowls.,You once broke a rib trying to wrestle one of those inflatable floppy guys at a car dealership.,I won.,Now you sprained your shoulder trying to clean out the stupid gutter.,You even have a job.,We have a bank account!,That's it.,"We've held out as long as we could, but it finally happened.",We're boring.,We're boring people who bore each other by being boring.,No!,We are still fun!,I'm gonna prove it to you.,"Tonight, at the gala, we are gonna do something spontaneous and weird.",Okay.,Stop taunting me.,Get on the phone to Washington.,Call in every favor that we have.,"Dave, put Missouri on the back burner, this is top priority.","You all have 36 hours to find me $90 million, go!",Whoa!,$90 million?,"Well, I only have $2 million in the discretionary fund, and I've already used some of it to make Thomas Jefferson sexier in those Mount Rushmore promotions.","Which, by the way, attendance has been up.",That's not a coincidence.,Pawnee's rich and famous will all be here tonight.,Maybe you start there.,That is a very smart idea.,And that tuxedo makes you look like a sexy orchestra conductor.,Here.,Wave this pen around.,Focus.,Fine.,Let's go get that park.,That park is my dream.,I'm not gonna let it slip away.,Who cares if Gryzzl and Ron have more money?,"I have the most valuable currency in America, a blind, stubborn belief that what I am doing is 100% right.",Ken Hotate!,Great bolo tie.,Is that new?,"Why, yes, it is.",My son sells them on Etsy.,He is a huge disappointment.,"Oh, well, now that we're chatting, the National Park Service is looking to buy the Newport Land, but we're a little short on funds.",How short?,$88 million.,What do you say you put some of that casino money to good use?,"You know, we have been considering opening a second resort.","No, it would be a donation.",The government would keep the land.,So you would like the Wamapoke people to pay the federal government millions of dollars to buy land that was stolen from us by the federal government?,And we don't even get to keep the land?,"Well, when you put it like that, I see the irony.","So, are you in?",No?,What if I buy some of your disappointing son's bolo ties?,Damn it.,"Hey, check it out.","I'm so crazy and spontaneous, I don't even need this sling anymore.",Yes.,Oh.,Did you hear that pop?,Did you hear that?,You wanna do shots?,"Yeah, I'd love to do a shot.",'Cause wine makes me sleepy now.,This is gonna be fun.,What do you wanna do first?,I dare you to eat this entire jug of olives.,Done.,What are you doing?,I'm gonna take a Zantac.,All that salt will give me heartburn.,"Oh, God.",You ruined it.,We have to figure something else out.,Should I still take the Zantac?,"Yeah, you always feel better when you do.","Oh, my God.","I hate us, let's go.","Now, I know all of you are off doing your own things, and we don't see each other as much as we used to, but I need my old team back for one last mission.","So, hands in ""Defeat Ron"" on three!","One, two, three.","Oh, actually, Ron promised me I could build a restaurant on the new Gryzzl campus.",So I'm kind of totally on Ron's side.,"Okay, Tom's dead to me.",Donna?,I'm waiting for your hand.,Yeah.,Ron hired Regal Meagle Realty to broker the deal.,And I'm gonna need the money for my wedding.,Shia LaBeouf designed wedding dresses do not come cheap.,"Oh, my God.",You're getting married?,That's amazing!,And you didn't tell me earlier.,How could you?,Joe popped the question a few days ago.,I didn't post anything on Gryzzl Feed 'cause I wanted to tell you in person.,"It's very beautiful, and I'm furious at you.",How are you?,How are the kids?,They're great.,"You know, they're trying to destroy us.","There's three of them, it's insane, but they're great.","We gotta run, Les.",Sorry for totally crushing it and you in the process.,Later.,"Well, never fear, because Terry is here.","Yes, I go by Terry now.",Because there was a guy at National Parks.,"He was already named Larry, so they suggested I go by Terry.","And then I said my real name is Gary, and they said, ""Who cares?",""" So, it's just a fun group.",Good evening and welcome to the Pawnee Bicentennial Gala.,"Not long ago, this town was barely on the map.",Unless you're talking about a map of the cities with the most obese pets.,But then one great man came along and he lifted all of us up.,And that man was me.,"Tom Haverford, owner and proprietor of the effortlessly chic, celebritypacked Italian restaurant, Tom's Bistro.",And several other establishments.,"Ron, how could you?",I simply took a skewer for one shrimp and added many shrimp to it.,They're long enough for five or six.,"First you try to steal my park, and now you steal my team?",I didn't steal them.,"They're independent people who have moved on to better things, just like you did.",Baconwrapped shrimp?,I fit seven on this one.,It's a masterpiece.,"Why don't you shove them all in your dumb mouth and then when I turn around, you can stab me in the back with the skewer?","People come up to me, and they say things like, ""Tom, given all that you've accomplished, is it hard to stay humble?",""" And I say, ""Not for me.","""I'm pretty amazing at being humble.",""" But enough about me.","Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Pawnee's Man of the Year 2017, Mr.",Ben Wyatt!,Thank you.,Thanks.,And thank you to Tom for that moving tribute to you.,And thank you to the Boys and Girls Club for the incredibly lifelike papiermch statue.,"You know when I first moved here, I Oh, uh I guess it's time for cake?",Okay.,Great.,Perfect timing.,How about this?,"We shut off the lights, turn 'em back on.",Everybody's fancy jewelry is missing.,"Meanwhile, you and I are already on a boat to the airport.",Let's put stink bombs in all the vents.,Yes.,Wait.,No.,I forgot.,I got rid of all the stink bombs before I babysat Leslie's kids.,Being responsible adults sucks butts.,Butts.,That's it.,I'll streak across the stage.,Yes.,I love it.,I'm gonna get naked.,I'm gonna get up there.,Everyone is gonna see my wiener.,"I mean, you've seen it.",You know how dumb it looks.,Uhhuh.,Perfect plan.,Why are you even here?,What have you ever done for this city?,My company has stimulated Pawnee's economy.,You're just still upset about Morningstar.,I told you to never say that word to me!,No one should ever say that word out loud.,"It's like ""Voldemort"" or ""Ron.",""" You know what?",You don't deserve that candle!,Give me that candle!,Let go!,Let go!,This candle's mine!,No!,Gimme this candle.,"You steal my team, I steal your candle!",I stole nothing!,Guys!,I want it!,Leslie!,Stop!,Stop!,It's okay.,Everything's fine.,Just wheel out the backup cake.,There's no backup cake.,Who doesn't bake a backup cake?,Okay.,"Well, that seals it.",Even Leslie is crazier than we are.,"They're still gonna serve that cake, right?","And then I said, ""Uh, you might wanna check with the penguin.",""" I get it.",You Gryzzl guys are a real hoot.,And you have so much money.,"Thanks, Jessie!","And, hey, enjoy that new prototype Gryzzl Tablet.",I will.,I just love it!,"Thank you, Jessica.","I love you, too.",I love your skin.,Give me your skin.,Oh!,There are still a couple bugs with the Al software.,But maybe just turn it off before you go to sleep.,"All right, Donna.",Let's hit it.,About to get some pennies!,"Pennies, oh, pennies, oh, pennies.", Okay., You're next.," Hello, Ron.", I just want you to know that I am not sorry that I pushed you into a giant cake.," Well, I am sorry that I attended a public event."," Yo, Ron."," Come on, bud."," We're gonna go play some video games, and we want you to watch quietly."," After we drop off the renters insurance forms, we need to stop by the grocery store.", And then we need to sign a suicide pact because our lives are meaningless.," Babe, we are not boring people."," Would boring people get renters insurance, even though it's not legally required? Where are we? I have never once been to this part of Pawnee.", It's the creepy warehouse district., It's mostly just raccoons and old car batteries., Whoa! Hang on., Pull over., Look at that., This place is amazing.," Let's go in! What up, playa? I just wanted to apologize for my intro running long."," But, you know, when it comes to inspirational Will Smith quotes, how you gonna stop at 10? You know, when the Chamber of Commerce asked you to introduce me, I was a little worried you would spend the entire time talking about yourself, which is exactly what you did.", I'm sorry., Truth is they didn't ask me to introduce you., I asked them if I could do it.," I was gonna talk about how I owe you so much, and how you stood by me through all of my failures, and I stood by you through all of your terrible outfits."," But when I got up there, I got pretty emotional."," To make it up to you, I'd like to read you the speech now."," ""I've known a lot of ballers in my day."," ""But no man balls harder than the man I'm about to bring up."," ""He's kind."," ""He's intelligent."," ""He's a person I'm deeply proud to call my friend.",""" It was a pretty good speech."," I mean, it was a little sappy maybe.", But I think I liked it.," Jessica, Mr."," Nelsson, you are going to hear a lot of bids today.", But this is the only one that matters., Is this a circle? Or is it an O? Is Oprah involved in your bid? It's a zero., I bid zero dollars.," I have to say, that's one of the lower ones we've seen."," Pawnee is celebrating its 200th anniversary, and the Newport family has been here since day one."," Through feast and famine, transformation, upheaval, celebration.", The Newport family is part of the fabric of this town.," And not always in a good way, like when your hot fudge pipeline exploded."," Oh, boo-hoo! It all ran off into the lake."," Well, yes, admittedly, it did make the fish taste delicious, but it was a PR nightmare.", Mmm-hmm., My question is this.," What do you want the Newport name to mean in the future? If you donate this land, and you let me turn it into a national park, the Newport National Park, your name will stand for something good for generations to come.", How much was her bid again? It was zero dollars., Oh! That's the part I don't like., Yeah., Just keep me in the running., Give me a chance to prove to you how great this could be.," It says here there are 12 closets, three bomb shelters, five dumbwaiters, two and three-eighths baths, no kitchens.", It's a fairly standard layout., Cool.," Is that a staircase to nowhere? Yes, it is.", Good eye., What was this place? Remember the Pawnee Doll Head Factory? This was a doll head factory? No., This was a holding cell for people who went insane on the assembly line.," What's behind this door? Fire pole! So this place has had zero offers? People seem to be scared off, on account of it being haunted and disgusting."," After 47 years living here, I decided to move to Orlando to be closer to Disney World.", We are responsible adults., You know what that means? I know., We have money., And we are going to buy the out of this house! Seriously? Yes., Who needs rental insurance? We're gonna live here., We now go live to the press conference., Good evening.," I'm Attorney Trevor Nelsson with the law firm Fwar, Dips, Winshares, Gritt, Babip, Pecota, Vorp and Eckstein, legal counsel to the Newport family, here to announce that the Newport Family Trust has narrowed this search to two final candidates, the Gryzzl corporation and the National Park Service.", Okay., I'm in the game., All I have to do is convince them that it's better taking no money than taking $90 million.," Well, you did convince three unsuspecting toddlers that peas turn into cupcakes in their tummies.", I started my career in Pawnee by turning a pit into a cool little park.," And now I have the chance to give this town a massive, beautiful gift that they can use forever."," In the words of Jason Bourne, ""This is where it started for me."," ""This is where it ends.",""" You know, I still think Kevin James was a weird choice for the reboot."," Oh, I don't.", I think he nailed it.," So, I'm thinking, in addition, to the Tom's Bistros, we have a hyper exclusive lounge area called Tommy's Lounge.", Attention! This is war., You guys are going down., And that's all I wanted to say.," Except Donna, Tom, hey."," I'm sorry I haven't kept in better touch with you recently, but, you know, I've been a little preoccupied with my kids and my job."," So, it's really good to see you both."," And also, prepare for war because you chose the wrong side and we are gonna smoke you."," And also I made cookies, but Ron is not allowed to eat them and they say, ""Prepare for War"" on them, but the O in the word ""for"" is a heart.", And I ate a lot of 'em on the way over here., Because we're at war.," Hey, Tom! Hey, man! Buddy, good to see you.", How's it going? It's pretty good., Hey! Andy! Let's go., War!   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 02,"Knopey, my girl, wuddup?",I just farted.,"Oh, Jeremy.",I truly thought that I would never have to interact with you again.,"I missed you, too.",The city council is voting on whether to rezone the Newport land for commercial use.,"If I win, stupid Gryzzl and stupid Ron can't build anything there, and then I'm sitting pretty.","Sadly, the deciding vote is from my old city council mate, and human equivalent of gas station sushi, Jeremy Jamm.","So, I am here to talk to you about why you should vote ""No"" in the zoning issue.",Whoa!,"Hold up, little chica.","Before we go any further, I need to ask my girlfriend how she wants me to vote.",Why?,Who's your girlfriend?,"Hello, Leslie.",Tammy.,Wow.,Jamm and Tammy!,"""Jammy.",""" Jammy.",You guys are so cute.,"When did you Why would either one of you, you know Why?","Dear God, why?",Hit it off at karaoke.,"She saw me nail Gangsta's Paradise, I saw her bite the door guy.",She then let me buy her a bunch of purses.,And the rest is history.,A bunch.,Wait a second.,This is great news.,Because Ron is my opponent in this.,And you live to torture Ron.,Vote for me so that you can screw Ron over.,Maybe you're not a blonde bimbo after all.,Thank you.,Well.,Let me mull it over.,"Sure, I'm aligning myself with terrible people, but think of all the wonderful people who will benefit from a national park.",It's worth it.,"And you can trust my opinion because I have a lot to gain by being right, and I have severe tunnel vision about achieving my goals.","Joan, on behalf of the entire city, congratulations.",I do want to apologize for not being able to accommodate some of your requests.,"For example, we couldn't get a bottle of Chateau Marmont because it's a hotel in Los Angeles, not a wine.","Well, did you at least get Buddy Holly to sing?","No, because he's been famously dead for 60 years.",What?,"Hi, Joan.","Hi, my name is April.",And I'm your biggest fan and I pretty much hate everyone.,Will you sign your ninth memoir for me?,"Well, it would be my pleasure.",You said your name was Glenn?,"Yes, I did.",That's pretty.,"Joan has always been kind of a train wreck, but the last three years, she's gone off the deep end.",She did a string of shows from rehab.,"Victoria Herzog, you were a successful attorney from Wilmington, Delaware.",Then you hit rock bottom.,This is supposed to be anonymous.,She once gave every member in her audience a car.,"One car, that they all had to fight for.","Oh, and last year, she did a show where she called all of her exboyfriends while sitting on a washing machine.","Well, Erik, if you didn't give it to me, then who did?",I love her so much.,I hope she's my real mom.,"""Entrepreneur bachelor, Tom Haverford, ""is making quite a splash in the culinary world, ""and we expect even bigger things from him in 2018.",""" Tom.",What does culinary mean?,It means it's a cause for celebration.,"Round of drinks for everyone, on the house!",Yeah!,Let me also get a chicken parm and a lasagna on the side.,And a spaghetti to go.,On the house!,Yes.,That's the fourth engagement this month.,"I'm tired of being an ""Entrepreneur/bachelor.",""" I need to find someone.","Are you bummed, Tom?","Hey, I got a quick fix for that.",Let's get hammered.,Everything here is free.,Ron.,Miss Knope.,How's that zerodollar bid coming along?,"You know, in my experience with capitalism, people would normally expect money in exchange for their goods and land.","In my experience with butt faces, you are one.",We will now hear arguments about the Newport property.,"First, on behalf of Gryzzl, Mr.",Ron Swanson.,"Thank you, Councilman.","When you vote tomorrow, we believe you should vote to rezone the land for commercial use.","Well, I'm convinced.","Tomorrow, I'm voting for Gryzzl.",What?,I didn't even get a chance to say my plan.,Your plan?,You know who else had a plan?,Please don't say Hitler.,Adolf Hitler!,I'm with Swanson.,It's a stache thing.,Stache bros.,You wouldn't understand.,We're done here.,"Well, that was easy.",What the hell just happened?,"Thank you, Commissioner Gordon, people of Gotham.",Okay.,She thinks she's in Batman.,"People often ask me, ""Joan, how do you do it?",""" It's simple.",I love being on TV.,I've known what I've wanted to do since I was 10 years old.,That is the key to living a good life.,"If you don't absolutely love what you do with a true passion, then what's the point in doing it at all?","On a separate note, I think that America should have a purge night.",Let me explain why.,Do I even like my job?,"I must be the first person ever to have money, power, and notoriety, but still feel empty.",I need someone to share my life with.,What if your future wife is somebody that you already know?,Let's open your Gryzzl page.,What about her?,She's cute.,Date her.,That's my cousin.,How about her?,That's my dad!,What's wrong with you?,"I'm drunk, okay?",Why are you only friends with your family?,"Oh, look, you got a message from somebody named Lucy in Chicago.",She looks familiar.,"Yeah, we used to date.",I was super into her.,"No, that's not it.",Was she in Destiny's Child?,"""Hey Tom, saw the article, you boss!","""Let's catch up soon.",Miss you.,""" Do you realize what's happening?",We've been sitting here searching for your soul mate this whole time and then Lucy just Gryzzltexts you out of nowhere?,It's a sign!,And we have to catch it.,We are going to Chicago.,Andy?,Think about what you're saying right now.,'Cause it's the smartest idea anyone's ever had!,Let's go!,Yeah!,Ron!,What did you do?,I delivered a flawless presentation and secured tomorrow's vote.,"No, you got all sneaky and snuck around and snooked that vote away from me.",And I know this because earlier I sneaked and snooked around and Jammy was supposed to vote for me!,The snooker has become the snorked!,What are you talking She's near.,"Hey, Ron.",Tammy.,"So, you two are together now.",My condolences to both of you.,You guys were supposed to vote for me.,"Leslie, I would never do anything to help you.",You've always been against me and Ron.,"You're a big part of the reason that he and I aren't together, and I had to settle for this placeholder.",I love you so much.,So you thought if you voted for Ron you could actually win him back?,Yeah.,That's right.,"Did it work, baby?",Are you horny with gratitude?,You two more than deserve each other.,Good luck.,The vote is tomorrow.,"If I don't get Jamm out from Tammy's clutches, I'm doomed.",It's like rescuing a bunny from a lion.,But that lion is a demonic sociopath with really nice cleavage.,"All right, we're here.","Sir, where the hell are we?",Chicago.,That'll be $830.,"Oh, no!",This is so dumb!,"Oh, awesome.",Turn the car around.,We're going back home.,No way.,Pay me.,And get the hell outta my cab.,Pay the man.,Chicago!,The big apple.,"Well, that's where Lucy works.",Yeah?,We must've given the cabbie the address.,"Let's just get something to eat, and fly home.",What?,No.,We came all this way.,"Tom, we should at least say hi.",No.,You can't not talk to someone for five years and then show up unannounced where they work in a different city.,That's what murderers do before they murder someone.,Tom?,I thought that was you.,What are you doing here?,"Oh, uh You're not gonna murder me, are you?",No.,I'm here doin' stuff.,Um Lucy.,Hey.,"Andy Dwyer, remember me?",Yeah.,He's here helping me find a place to live.,I just got a job here.,"And then when you hit him up on Gryzzl, he was like, ""Let's go say hi to Lucy since we're already here in Chicago.",""" Yeah.",That's the deal.,"Cool, what job is it?",Head coach of the Chicago Bulls.,"No, he's working at a nonprofit.",No.,What?,Am I?,"Oh, that sucks.","Well, listen, I got some stuff I gotta do in the office, but I wanna hang out.",Do you wanna meet me here in an hour?,"Yeah, that sounds great.",We'll go a little Chicago deep dish pizza.,And go watch the Bears.,And No.,I'm sorry I started doing that.,"Hey, April.",How's it going?,Fine.,Except hearing Joan talk about her passion and doing what you really love totally freaked me out.,"Eight years ago, I accepted a random internship at the parks department, and then Leslie told me to do a bunch of stuff, and now I'm executive director of regional whatever, and I don't even know what it means.",And I never even asked myself if I even really like it.,"I mean, it's like, what is my purpose in life?",What do I even care about?,My insides are dying.,"So, not fine.",I don't know what to do.,I have to quit.,To do what?,I'm just gonna go live under a bridge and ask people riddles before they cross.,"Okay, hold on.",Do you remember what Joan said at the ceremony?,That it doesn't count as stripping if no one pays you?,"Yes, she did say that.",But no.,She knew she wanted to be on TV when she was 10.,"So, what did you wanna be when you were 10?",It says here the future of caskets may just be biodegradable plastic.,"Oh, you don't say.",Hey.,Are you chilly?,"I'm a little chilly, I think.",No.,"Hey, guys.",Welcome.,I'm Dan.,Hi.,"I'm Ben, this is April.",And I'm scared of death.,I'm just really interested in learning what you do.,You're gonna love it here.,People are dying to get in.,"Come on, come on.",We'll start down at the cadaver chute!,The cadaver chute.,Come on!,So this is where you wanna eat lunch?,In a steakhouse?,Don't you have irritable bowel syndrome?,"God, I hate that I know that.","Yeah, it's murder on the old plumbing.",But Tammy only wants me to eat steak and whiskey.,She has my stool analyzed just to keep me honest.,I don't think this relationship is that healthy.,I mean it seems like Tammy is trying to turn you into Ron.,And you're Jeremy Jamm!,"I mean, come on.",You love Porsches and spiked iced tea.,And you have a Hooters platinum card.,Yeah.,Tammy doesn't really let me do that stuff anymore.,"But, you know, it's good, you know?",I'm better now.,"I mean, sure, I'm depressed, and I'm constantly sick, and nothing really brings me joy.",But it just feels right.,"Oh, God!","Oh, boy.","Help me, Knope.",I used to be so great.,Remember?,Everybody thought so.,"Well Oh, God!","Oh, God!",Wow.,This is worse than I thought.,You're broken.,She has broken you.,You need to get away from her.,"Oh, God!",Whoa!,"Hey, look at that.",More hair came out.,"Yeah, I think you're really gonna like it here.","And obviously, everyone's in a really great mood now because of the Cubs winning the series.",Yeah.,It seems really nice.,"I mean, I am gonna miss Pawnee, though.",My wife's there for cryin' out loud.,"Yeah, tell me about Pawnee.",It sounds like it's really changed.,"Oh, yeah.",There's a ton of new businesses.,"Gryzzl came in, they gave everyone free tablets and WiFi and phones.","You can watch Hitch 2  anytime, anywhere!",Finally!,That's the dream.,"Part of me wants to go back, you know.",I always kinda liked it there.,"Man, you got me really missing Pawnee now.",I don't know what to do.,Am I making the right decision?,Hey.,Why are you here?,I'm calling a temporary truce.,You need to help me break up Jamm and Tammy.,Forget it.,You just want Jamm to switch his vote.,"What is this, revenge for Morningstar?","No, it is not about that.",It's not about the vote.,There is a guy in real trouble and you might be the only one who can help him.,This is about saving someone's soul.,He is a monster.,Monsters do not have souls.,"Uh, have you ever seen Monsters, Inc.",?,No.,"Dammit, Ron!",Engage in the culture once in a while!,Jamm!,Get in here!,"Good God, man, what happened to you?",Tammy happened to him!,"Remind you of anyone, Ron?",We need to put our issues aside and defend this miserable person!,Jeremy.,This is a gold bar.,You keep that in your desk?,I will give you this gold bar if you say one unflattering thing about Tammy.,"If I do, does Tammy get to keep the gold?","Oh, my God!","When it comes to Tammy, the code is the same as that of the battlefield.","First, you leave no man behind.","Second, you must protect yourself against chemical warfare.",Tammy does not abide by the Geneva Convention.,I made this Tammy deprogramming kit in case I ever fell victim to her again.,"First, this is a chastity belt that I made by hand.","It might be a couple sizes too big for you, but you can just pad it.",The first step is to cut out all sex.,That won't be necessary.,We haven't done the deed yet.,She lets me rub up against her leg sometimes.,"Well, all the more reason to wear it.","She knows she has that card left to play, and you best believe she will.",We're also gonna try a Pavlovian technique.,"Ron is holding Tammy's perfume, Girth.",Oh.,It smells good.,Again.,Tammy.,How many times are we gonna do this?,Until the bottle is empty.,Again.,Twice.,Tam No!,It's going well so far but it's too early to tell.,He was pretty far gone.,"Hopefully, we get a body in today so I can show you guys the really fun part.",Draining!,"Oh, God!",I hate this so much.,Cool.,Can I touch a dead body?,Whoa!,"Slow down, eager beaver!",That doesn't happen for at least a year.,Why?,How did you become a mortician?,Can't I just sign up?,"Oh, gosh, no!",You need two years of school and a yearlong apprenticeship.,The first few years are mostly paperwork and filing.,Why is every job just paperwork?,"Hey, it's a living.",Yeah.,"I think we're gonna go, Dan.",The reality of your life is incredibly depressing.,"I'm just gonna stay at my current job until I get old and die and then end up here, being embalmed by some weirdo who had to go to school for three years just to cut my guts open.",Let's go.,"Oh, thank God!","Okay, have a good one.",Okay.,We're gonna do some scenes and demonstrate ways that you can resist Tammy.,"I will play Tammy, Ron will play you.","""Hey there, horsey.","""Time to mount up and ride on into Bonertown.","""What do you say we get stanky in that pet store bathroom, Jamm?",""" Hmm?",Huh?,Do it.,"""There will be no sex today, Tammy.",""" Oh!","""Instead, why don't you go into the pet store and feed yourself to the snakes?"," ""To hell with you woman, goodbye.",""" ""Hey, ya big hunk of wiener meat."," ""I've got forty hand towels, some energy bars, and a Chinese finger trap."," ""Let's get gross.",""" ""This gambit has failed."," To hell with you woman, goodbye.",""" What are you wearing? It's a crotch blinder of my own design."," In this scenario, she will be coming at you pants-less."," Okay, the doors are locked, windows secured, there is no way Tammy's getting in here."," ""Jamm! Strip down, you sex maggot!"" And hold! What was your mistake? You didn't check the armoire.", Tammy once camped out in my attic for six days awaiting my arrival., She survived on rats and rainwater.," Let's run it again! I gotta say, hanging out with Lucy's been so fun.", She's the best.," And I love that she's buying us stuff! Dude, make your move.", Ask her out.," I dunno, she lives here.", How would it even work? Life is about taking risks.," Look at me, Tom.", I'm moving to Chicago! It's just us right now.," Do you really think you're moving here? One XXL, one kid's XL.", Hey! You remembered my size! Yeah., Thank you., You're welcome.," Hey, Lucy, can I ask you something? Of course, what's up? I was wondering would you wanna maybe Come work for me in Pawnee? I got the company and it's growing so fast, I can't do it all myself."," And I need a manager, and you're a perfect candidate."," Wow, really? That does sound kinda awesome.", And it'd be super fun to work with you.," I mean, I'd have to talk to my boyfriend about it first, but Yeah, of course! This is all perfect, and everything's worked out just as I'd hoped."," Hey, this is why they call it Beantown, huh? Hey, Jerebear."," What are you doing with these two jabronis? Tammy, I've given this a lot of thought.", We should break up.," What's the matter, little boy? Did the bad people get to you? They just made me realize how unhealthy this is.", Literally.," All the steak and whiskey, I have to wear a diaper."," That's 'cause you're my widdle baby! We drilled you on this, Jamm! Baby talk, what do you do? I'm not a baby! I'm a big boy! Yeah, okay."," Well, that wasn't terrible."," Don't listen to Leslie, she's just trying to manipulate you.", All she cares about is herself and I can prove it.," How's this, Leslie? You leave us alone, and we swing the vote to you.", Help you get your park., No., Nice try.," Stay strong, Jeremy."," It's over, Tammy.", Tell you what., It's been long enough., What do you say we consummate our relationship tonight? Huh? Let's do it., And the last card is played., What are you doing? This is a library! Do you see what's happening here? Ron.," I need that crotch blinder! No, you don't.", Just end it., Look at my boobs., No., Look downstairs., No., There's a prize inside for you.," It's over, Tammy."," What? To hell with you, woman.", Goodbye., How dare you? Are you kidding me? You'll be back.," They all come back! They call come back! Well done, Jeremy.", Turns out the crotch blinder was inside you all along.," Come on, everybody! Who wants to get it on? I'm naked."," Donna, what do I do? If working around corpses isn't even right for me, then nothing is.", I feel totally lost., Saturn's Return.," What? Saturn's orbit around the sun takes roughly 29 years, and when it gets back to where it was when you were born, lots of turmoil, self-discovery."," When I was your age, I got banned from every riverboat in Germany.", Donna., April.," What're you up to? Oh, you know.", Just regionally directing the Midwest whatever of who cares., Isn't it great? Can you believe that they pay me for this? Because I would do this for free.," Jeez! I do miss you, Terry.", Let me get you some napkins., April., You looked at one horrifying job., I've got a few more ideas., We'll find you something you like.," Okay? Okay, but you can't tell Leslie I might leave.", She'll have a heart attack., Promise? I promise.," Why are you so into helping me right now? Because I'm finally doing what I love, and I know how hard it is to get to that place."," And I want you to be happy, because you're my friend."," No, I'm not.", I've never cared for you.," Wait, wait.", You're behaving very strangely., Saturn's Return.," Hey, Brokemons.", I just wanted to let you know that I will be abstaining from the vote today., You are my two all-time best friends., And you brought me back from the brink.," So, I can't choose sides."," Although, if I had to pick one side, it would be Lucy Liu's backside."," Without Jamm, the vote's two-two.", This was all for nothing., I thought it was very big of you to not bend when Tammy promised you the vote.," Well, I thought it was very big of you to help him at all.", You didn't have to do that., Okay.," Back to work, to figure out how to destroy you.", Same., Goodbye.," Dude, thank you so much for this.", I really owe you one.," No, you don't.", You're smart and qualified and we're totally lucky to have you.," Okay, let's do this."," I still don't know what ""claiming allowances"" means.", I always just put six.," So far, so good."," Dude, you are totally going to jail.", This couldn't have worked out any better., There was a guy eating lunch in here who didn't finish his spaghetti.," Also, Tom and Lucy are totally gonna fall in love.", Five-second rule!   ,"

Reasonableists.","Oh, boy.",The land is sacred in our religion because it's the place where all human souls will be transmuted when Zorp the Lizard God passes through Jupiter's Sphincter.,Hail Zorp.,Hail Zorp.,I'm looking for anything to strengthen my case that the Newport land should become a park and not a corporate campus.,"Religious reasons, animal conservation, historical significance.",Anything.,"So, hold onto your straws, everybody, because Mama's going grasping.","In 1980, there were more than 600 million Indiana Brown Ants in that forest.","Today, there are only 595 million.","At that rate, they'll all be gone by the year 203060.",Two hundred and three thousand and sixty?,Two hundred thousand years from now?,Yes.,That doesn't seem like an immediate crisis.,I've got a different idea for that land.,An amusement park with rides and food and sexy cartoon characters.,I call it Disneyland.,How did you get in here?,Broke a window.,"Hey, guys.",Come on in.,"You guys, I am Roscoe.",I am Vice President of Cool New Shizz here at Gryzzl.,Feel free in this meeting to break out your vapes and just kick back.,"Now, peep this.",Leslie Knope has been meeting with people to try to sexy up her presentation.,"So, we had this farout brain tornado.",Good idea.,"We should get a brity to come kick it with us smalltime and then just be like, ""Hey, chums.",Let's get tight with Gryzz.,""" We need a celebrity as a minority owner.",It will strengthen Gryzzl's bid.,Is a celebrity necessary?,I prefer quality over flash.,That's why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.,Celebrities can help with this kind of thing.,The Nets wouldn't be in Brooklyn if it weren't for Jay Z.,And the sales for ChickfilA went through the roof once Elton John bought them.,Exactly.,Gryzzl is an outsider here in Pawnee.,"So, a local celebrity is going to make everyone feel more at ease with us.",And that's why we called on you home court chillers to frack your brainiums.,"Since we're locals, they want us to think of ideas I got it from context.",Okay.,I have no interest in consorting with celebrities.,"The only celebrities I recognize are furniture maker Garry Knox Bennett, designer of the notorious and Magnus, the 5x5 bull elk I saw near my cabin two years ago.","Took a shot at the bastard, and he stuck his antlers through the door of my meat shed.","One day, Magnus, I will wear you as a jacket.",Have you thought about this?,You could be an airline pilot.,I don't like heights.,What about a submarine pilot?,I don't like depths.,"I don't like anything, okay?",You're not gonna be able to find a career for me.,"So, just give up.","No way, babe.",We can do this.,Let's play a game.,Okay?,"You say a word, I say a word, we see if it makes a profession.",Executive.,Trampoline.,Computer.,Trampoline.,Trampoline.,Pass.,"Hey, Leslie, I need both you and Ron to sign this City Point of Sale document, since the land you're gunning for lies within city limits.",Can we run over to Ron's office and take care of this?,"Well, I love it when you talk Point of Sale docs.",You know it turns me on.,But no.,No.,There's no way that I will be in the same room with Ron Swanson unless it is during a police lineup when I am pointing him out as the man who betrayed me.,"""That's him, officer!",Ronald Swanson.,""" ""Thank you, Leslie, that's the fifth crime you've solved this month.","""I'm not supposed to do this, but let me give you a badge and"" Could you please focus?",It will take two minutes.,"And all signatures need to be notarized, and I really don't want to have to schedule two different notary appointments.","Not to eavesdrop, But I have a crazy story.","I recently had a bit of a health scare, just a couple weeks in the hospital.","Oh, God.",This story's terrible so far.,"Anyway, I became really motivated once I got out to finally live life to the fullest.","So, I fulfilled one of my lifelong dreams, and I became a Notary Public.","So, if I go with you, Ron and Leslie can sign the document separately.",Yeah.,"See, Ben?",It all works out.,"I'll sign the documents here, and then you can bring it to Ron and he can sign it there, and then you can tell Ron to rot in hell.",How long are you two going to go on like this?,You're acting like a little kid.,"No, I'm not.",And infinity plus one year.,"Andy, bring in the next person.",Perd Hapley.,Crazy Ira and the Douche.,Tom Haverford?,"That's nice, but I don't know if you can really consider me a celebrity.",Yeah.,That's your handwriting.,"These are all great options, but I think we need to go after Pawnee's biggest fish.",Annabel Porter from Bloosh.,That horrifying Lifestyle Newsletter filled with vegan recipes and pointless tchotchkes?,Forget it.,That woman is my nightmare.,"Um, she's a big deal, Ron.",Bloosh has won the Pulitzer Prize for best top ten listicle two years in a row.,"Hi, Leslie.",Bill Haggerty from the Pawnee Historical Society.,"Oh, yes, Bill, I remember you.","I heard you were looking for information on the Newport land, and I have some very exciting news for you.",It concerns William Henry Harrison.,We claim William Henry Harrison as a hero because he was the first governor of the Indiana territories and then President of the United States.,"We're also a little ashamed of him because he didn't wear a coat at his inauguration, caught a bad cold and died 32 days later.",He's an embarrassing footnote.,But he's our embarrassing footnote.,I've recently selfpublished a biography about Harrison entitled Barely a President.,William Henry Harrison's ThirtyTwo Days in the White House.,I discovered that Harrison had a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land you're trying to acquire.,"Um, spoilers much?",Now I'll never read that book.,"If a US President had a house on that land, it could qualify for historic landmark status, and we could really stick it to Ron's team.","Which would be icing on the cake, not the reason why we're doing this.",Okay.,Show me this incredible lodge.,Let's go.,"That book sounded so boring, I cried a little.","Oh, babe, I'm sorry you had to hear that.",You're safe now.,"Hey, Ron.","Sorry to bother you, but I need you to sign this Point of Sale document.",And please sign it in cursive.,It raises a lot of red flags if you don't.,No.,Okay.,"So, what's Leslie up to?","Well, I don't think I should discuss that, given that you're in competition.",Need to remain neutral.,Fair enough.,"Terry, what's Leslie up to?",She is trying to find a historical reason to earmark the land for preservation.,"Terry, come on, man.","Leslie, you little sneak.","If Leslie is going for a hook, we should, too.",Let's get Annabel Bloosh person.,Yes.,Glad to see you've finally come around after these two minutes of insanity.,"Now, will you please consider investing in that toddler cologne I've been bugging you about?",Toddler cologne.,"Baby,  You smell good.",Here we are.,"Here we are, like, ""Here's the place where I buried the map ""that will show us the way to ""William Henry Harrison's awesome hunting cabin?",""" No.",This is all that's left.,This place is awesome.,"Babe, we should sell our dumb house and buy this one.","You know, I love William Henry Harrison as much, if not slightly more than, the next guy, but this is garbage.","I mean, literally.",There's a bag of old hamburgers over there.,What?,How old?,"We're running out of time, and we need to beat Ron.","So, we're going to have to use this old pile of bricks.",I need to gather everything I can on William Henry Harrison.,Let's head to the Harrison museum over in Vincennes.,I volunteer there part time.,I found an artifact!,Historical artifact!,William Henry Harrison's wig.,Andy.,Put that down.,Cool.,You've got to be kidding me.,"No, I'm sorry, Ben, but there's a page missing from the document.","So, then, the signatures are invalid.",Can't we just say it was there?,You're asking a notary to lie.,"I signed an oath, Ben.",And then a different notary notarized the oath I signed.,William Henry Harrison is totally ridiculous.,They can't even fill a small museum with real stuff about his life because he was so lame.,The If He'd Worn A Coat room explores how great America would have been if Harrison had worn a coat at his inauguration and not died.,This room is called Other Things That Were Famous For One Month.,"Oh, and side note, admission to this museum costs $14.","And while you're here, why not visit the Other Famous Harrisons exhibit?","Okay, guys, this is so great.","During the election campaign of 1840, William Henry Harrison supporters rolled this 10foot tin and paper ball down country lanes all across America.","And they would sing along with a jug band, and it was just so exciting.",People would come from miles just to see it.,Why?,Was there something inside the stupid ball?,Ooh!,Like a giant hamster?,"This is what we have to work with, okay?","We are up against a very flashy Internet company, and we should be aiming for quantity over quality.","So, we're going to throw a bunch of Harrison facts at them and a big pile of bricks and whatever else we can find.","Quantity, people!",Quantity!,Wow!,This is exactly what I imagined heaven looks like.,Right down to the unisex linen tunics.,"Annabel, ma chrie.",Hi.,I'm sorry I'm late for our coven.,I was polishing my oyster forks with a cagefree olive oil rub.,"Apology accepted, and then I have no reaction to anything else you said.","I can't help but ask, what's in right now?","Well, this season, I'm intrigued by asymmetrical overalls, angora toothbrushes, and locally sourced Italian flipflops.","Also, there's a flirty trend in beverages.","So, you've had soy milk and almond milk.","Now, try the hottest new craze, beef milk.",It's like almond milk that's been squeezed through tiny holes in living cows.,That's  milk.,No.,No.,Milk costs $3 a gallon.,"Annabel's authentic, handstrained teattotable Beef Milk?",That costs $60 a gallon.,Yeah.,And there's a wait list.,This woman knows business.,And I would be extremely jazzed to be part of the Gryzzl bid.,Shall we discuss it in my yurt?,Great.,Ron.,"Okay, let's try this again.",All pages accounted for.,Just sign right here.,How is Leslie doing with her quest?,"Again, I don't want to talk about her plan with you, nor yours with her.",I'm sure you understand.,Absolutely.,"Terry, what is Leslie up to?",Getting ready for a big press conference.,"Terry, come on!",A press conference?,"So, she's found something to strengthen her bid.",Ms.,Porter.,Mmm?,No need to discuss any further.,You will be the face of the Gryzzl bid.,Smashing.,"Well, this calls for a celebratory dram of aged grappa.","So, I just sign here?",No!,No!,No!,Ah!,Great.,There you go.,"Yeah, that's invalid now.",Yeah.,I know.,"Excuse me, Mr.",Haggerty?,I just wanted to say that I really like your museum.,It's weird and sad and unnecessary.,"Is there, like, a museum curator position I could apply for?","Sorry, everyone here is a volunteer.","Though you do get a yearly stipend of 50,000 Harrison Bucks.",Accepted only at that vending machine.,Thanks.,That's a bummer.,"But, hey, babe, listen.",Maybe you could start your own museum.,About what?,"I'm sorry, but I am not like you.",You love everything.,"The only things I like are dogs, sleeping late, and weird birthmarks.",You can't make museums about those.,This is another dead end.,Okay.,"Guys, let's keep it going.",Right?,Somebody grab the reading glasses.,Somebody grab that walking stick.,Grab everything you can.,I'm officially dubbing this Operation Quantity.,"Oh, thank God you're still here.",I cannot believe the weird notary hell I've been trapped in.,It's been more like heaven for me.,"I mean, what a day.",What's Ron up to?,"Okay, I am not No, you have to tell me because you legally bound yourself to me in marriage, sucker.","Okay, fine.",They got Annabel Porter to be the celebrity face of their group.,That little rat.,Okay.,Two can play this game.,"Bill, Operation Quantity needs a face.",Does William Henry Harrison have any direct descendants in the area?,One.,A distant nephew named Zach Harrison.,This is our guy!,American royalty!,His veins pulse with the blood of our storied forefathers!,Zach Harrison?,I went to camp with this guy.,No one would ride in the boat with him because he had terrible BO.,"Then, he went with Janine, our counselor, and he fell asleep and got a boner.","Well, he's American royalty.",Okay?,And we need him for the press conference.,And we need all of this stuff.,"So help me God, I will make a mountain out of this molehill.","Leslie, I do Quantity, people.",Notary publics can trace our origin all the way back to ancient Rome.,No way.,Calvin Coolidge was a notary.,Mmmhmm.,And so was Calvin Coolidge's dad and so was Calvin Coolidge's paternal grandfather.,Uhhuh.,It's 2.,5 pounds of pressure is what you need to get the perfect stamp.,"This monthly Well, it's a notary email newsletter.","And, oh, my gosh.",Right.,"Ben, it's fun.",It's just fun.,"Babe, I have been thinking a lot about what you said.",I made a list of everything that I know you like.,"Playing with our dog, staring contests, sex with me, etc.","And then, I lost the list.","So, I had to make a new list.","I didn't have any paper, so I wrote it on my leg.",And that's when my leg fell asleep.,"Okay, could you just skip ahead a little?",What do all the things on that list have in common?,They're oneonone.,You like dealing with people or dogs oneonone.,"See, we don't make a list of the things that you love.",We make a list of the reasons why you love them.,And then we find something that fits that list.,You're the best husband ever.,"Hi, Zach Harrison.",You wanted to meet with me about a press conference?,"Yes, hello, Zach.","Yes, I am Leslie.",It is an honor to have you here.,You are Indiana's last living link to this great man.,"Look, I really don't think you should make a big deal out of this.",I just happen to be a descendant of a guy.,"You could be the descendant of George Washington, I wouldn't know.",Do you?,"No, that was just a hypothetical Could that be possible?","Because, you know, I've always thought that we shared very similar jawlines.",Wow.,That's something to chew on.,"Anyway, okay, doesn't matter.",I need this to be very impressive.,"So, head on in there and be presidentially descended.",Just go in there.,Okay?,"Just walk, walk, walk there.",Quiet now.,Walk in.,Zach!,Camp Wamapoke.,You got a boner.,We'll catch up.,What a dick.,Hey!,No!,"No, no, no, no, no, no.",What?,"Ron, what are you doing here?","Setting up for our press conference, which will take place immediately after yours.",Are you crazy?,You can't do that.,Do you want me to bite him?,No.,Ignore them.,We start in 10 minutes.,"Swanson, you didn't say anything about ambushing Leslie's press conference.",I didn't think it was relevant.,"Come on, man.",This isn't cool.,This is a competition.,We need to win it.,Please do your jobs.,Good evening.,"Pawnee is a place of culture, history, and heritage.",And the National Parks Service is proud to say that we've discovered a new chapter in the life of local hero and President William Henry Harrison.,A heretofore unknown hunting lodge was recently discovered smack dab in the middle of the Newport land.,What great historical moments took place within these hallowed halls?,Did Harrison plan his presidential campaign while sitting around the hearth which used to be there.,"Did he write letters to Thomas Jefferson on his rolltop desk, which, you know, I don't know, might have existed.",The point is William Henry Harrison would have wanted this land preserved as a national park.,Don't believe me?,Let's ask him.," In the form of his direct descendant, Zachary."," Hi, I'm Zach.", Harrison., Amazing.," Zachary, what is it like being a descendant of William Henry Harrison? Uh Harrison's a pretty common last name."," Okay, sit."," Now, travel back in time with me to 1840, when William Henry Harrison, ""Old Tippecanoe,"" runs for President."," And his campaign rolls this giant tin and paper ball from town to town, while Americans everywhere sing along."," Hit it, gang! What has caused this great commotion, motion, motion Our country through It is the ball a-rolling on They're talking about this ball."," For Tippecanoe and Tyler, too Tippecanoe and Tyler, too And with him, we'll beat Little Van Martin Van Buren.", That's who.," Van is a used up man And with them we'll beat Little Van ""Wow, that was cool"", said some boring idiot from 200 years ago.", Who cares about some dumb grandpa and his tin ball? That's the past., Gryzzl is the future., The Newport land will become the Midwest headquarters of America's most dynamic technology company.," Here to introduce our vision is Annabel Porter from Bloosh, and the sexy ladies known in Pawnee as the Somebody's Daughter dancers.", Fresh., Innovative., Placemaking., Disposable duvets., Growth hacking., Super Moon., Gryzzl.," Now, come with me, as we binge-watch the future.", That was sickening.," All flash, and no substance.", It was exactly as substantive as your presentation.," No, it was not! We had way more quantity than you.", Please., Please.," For the love of all that is holy, both of you, please, sign this form.", Not that it matters., I'm definitely going to wake up tomorrow morning with the same forms for you to sign., Because I've died somehow and now I'm a ghost living in purgatory until I complete my unfinished business., I'm not signing anything he's signing.," Did you just hear what I said? No, of course you didn't.", Because I'm a ghost., You know what? I can't stand you., I can't stand your stupid mustache and your stupid shirt and your stupid name., Ron., Ron., That's not even a word.," Well, I have had just about enough of your stubborn behavior."," Ever since the Morningstar incident, you have been completely unreasonable."," You are the unreasonable one! You've been unreasonable way before Morningstar! You're the most unreasonable, stubborn person I have ever met, and I'm never gonna change my mind on that, no matter what anybody says! You're not that good at scrapbooking.", What? Okay., Would you just sign right here? And I will need your thumbprints.," Man, those two really hate each other."," That feud is, like, Biggie-Tupac level.", Maybe even Morgan Freeman-Shailene Woodley level., Naw.," It's bad, but it's not that bad.", This is like when the triplets fight except I can't just give Leslie and Ron stuffed animals to make them calm down.," Actually, that might work."," Have we tried that? Well, they've always butted heads, but I really I don't think they hate each other.", I just think they're very different people and they've just drifted apart once they stopped working in the same office., You okay? Yeah.," Well, I ordered 60 veggie pizzas to Ron's office."," So, that calmed me down a little.", I know you're furious at him.," But please, come to a neutral site and sit with Ron for 30 seconds so I can get this dumb document signed."," Ah! I'll let you rename the triplets Ruth, Bader, and Ginsburg."," Okay, fine.", But I get to sign first.," Oh, my God."," All right, let's just get this over with.", Let me get that for you., Got them! What? What's going on? What's going on? Let us out immediately., No., You guys are being ridiculous.," This has gone too far, and you are not leaving this office until you've made peace.", No!   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 04,No.,No.,No.,"Sorry, Ron.",Doors are locked.,We've taken your keycards and your phones and the automatic timer won't go off until tomorrow at 8:00 a.,m.,You're trapped in there.,We told security not to disturb you under any circumstances.,And the phones and Internet?,"Oh, they've been disconnected.",And I left a rusty hacksaw on the table.,"So, the first person who hacks their face off gets released.",That's not What?,Is that true?,"Guys, this is insane, okay?",Let us out.,"Oh, my God, babe, Game of Thrones is on tonight!",It's the series finale.,Khaleesi is marrying Jack Sparrow.,"Oh, God, that show has really gone off the rails.","Look, it makes sense if you've read the books.","Look, our baby monitor is on the table.","If you guys can talk this out and settle your differences like grownups, turn it on and I will come to get you from my office.","Otherwise, we will see you at 8:00 a.",m.,Tomorrow morning.,I am going to break out of here.,"Then, I am going to snap you in half.",Hey!,"This is not his fault, Swanson.",Be a man and get your house in order.,"You, too, Knope.","Good luck, you guys.",I really hope you can work out your differences.,Terry.,Look at me.,Is this what you want to do?,"Think very carefully, son.",There you go.,"That's right, buddy.",Come on.,"For once in your life, do something right.","Stop it, Terry!",Both of you.,Come on.,"Damn it, Terry!",Okay.,Think.,There must be a way out of here.,I don't think there is.,They installed these magnetic locks two years ago.,There's no way around them.,"Yes, there is.",I'll simply punch my fist through a window.,"Ron, there's security wire in there.",You'll slice your arm open.,I would rather bleed out than sit here and talk about my feelings for 10 hours.,There is another way.,"We'll just wait a few minutes, turn on this monitor, and then we'll tell Ben that we talked it out and made up.","I'll just tell them that I apologized for, whatever, heroically caring too much.","And you admitted that you were a stubborn butthead, and everything's fine now.",Why do I have to be stubborn?,Why can't the problem have been that I was reasonable and you were at fault?,Because we want them to believe us and not laugh really hard at a ridiculous sciencefiction scenario.,We are not saying I was the problem.,"If we're going to lie to them, I will not let you lie to them.","Fine, I'll tell them that, for the past three years, you've been a perfect gentleman and scholar, and I am an insane weirdo who, despite being the only reason we even had a friendship to begin with, decided to ruin it, out of the blue, for no good reason.",That sounds good.,Let's go with that.,Hut!,What are you doing?,I destroyed the monitor!,What if we have an emergency and have to get out of here?,I did not consider that possibility!,Everything's different.,"I mean, the furniture, the pictures Craig changed everything.",Did he?,I tried not to notice anything when I worked here.,"Or talk to anyone, or learn anyone's name.","You of all people should know that, Lauren.","Look, we are going to be here for 10 hours.","We can either talk about our issues and work through our problems, or we can just sit here doing nothing.","I choose ""sit here.",""" Come on, Ron, why don't we just Sit here.",Ron.,Sit here.,I bet I can make you talk.,"I'll take that bet at any odds, for any amount of money, over any length of time stretching from now into infinity.",Talk to me.,Talk to me.,Talk to me.,Talk to me.,Talk to me.,Talk to me.,Talk.,Talk.,Talk.,Talk to me!,Drip.,Drip.,"One word, and this is over.","I think wood is stupid, and so does everybody else.","You guys, Ron loves plastic.","Last chance, Ron.",You want to talk?,Huh?,Ahhah!,Jackpot.,"You know what this is, Ron?","This is a mix I made for the summer Parks barbecue, 2007.",I asked everyone in the Parks Department to choose one song.,You chose Buddy by Willie Nelson.,A fact I remember because my mind is a steel trap of friendship nuggets.,But I am not going to play your choice.,I'm gonna play Jerry's choice.,Ooh!,That's right.,And I'm gonna sing along.,And I'm gonna maintain eye contact the whole time.,And guess what?,I don't know the words.,"Harry Truman was a guy America, Red China All the countries, other people Everyone is fun Joe Mantegna, lan McKellen I have to buy a new toaster This is awesome You're so stupid Jumping up and down Whoo!",I got it on repeat.,"Come on, Ron.","Do you want to hear it again, or do you want to talk?",No?,"Okay, next verse.",Freddy Krueger bought some pants Oprah has a turtle farm Peter Piper peepee poopy Daddy ate a squirrel Stop this!,I will speak with you for three minutes.,Great.,"So, what would you like to talk about?","Oh, come on, Ron.",We were friends for 10 years.,We were work proximity associates.,We were friends.,And now we're not.,"And once again, it is up to me to save our friendship.",And I will do so using the most powerful tool known to man.,A wellorganized chart.,"Three years ago, I accept a job at National Parks.","You and I see each other less, admittedly, due to my busy schedule and your utter lack of interest in maintaining adult friendships.",Work proximity associateships.,"Three months later, April comes to work for me.",We throw her a party.,"At her request, the party's theme is ""Zombie Teenage Biker Gang Pizza Jamboree.",""" I remember.",You made me wear a leather jacket.,That is the last time you and I see each other for more than five minutes.,"Three months later, you come and visit me at my office on the third floor for the very first time.","One week later, I return from a trip, and I find out you have quit the Parks Department and you have started your own building company without even bothering to tell me.","""Oh, well,"" I think to myself, ""You know, it was only a matter of time.",""" And then, two months after that, Morningstar, the final twist of the knife.","Oh, for God's sake.","I hear about Morningstar, and I calmly saunter down to your office and attempt to have a rational discussion with you about it.","What the hell, Ron?",You're building your stupid building on the block next to Pawnee Commons?,The park that I built from scratch out of a pit?,"This building is gonna ruin the views, you jerk.",And you're gonna tear all the houses down?,Yes.,"Ann lived there, Ron.",That's Ann's old house.,That's my best friend's old house.,That was the house where I put on my wedding dress the night I got married.,That is the house where April and Andy met for the first time.,That is the house where Ann gave me my first ever smokyeye look.,She hasn't lived there for five years.,That's not the point.,This building is a monstrosity.,And what's it called?,"""Morningstar?",""" ""Oh, dear.","""We live at the Morningstar.","""That's so posh and hibbleyfibbleygibbley.",""" The world needs apartment buildings.",The park you built is nice and people want to live next to it.,That's not the point.,"You knew that I would be furious, and you didn't have the guts to tell me yourself.","Enjoy your new job, Judas.",You tear down Ann's house.,"You spend the next two years cutting down trees and fighting zoning laws that I helped pass, basically spitting on everything we did together at Parks.",That's not the whole story.,What does that mean?,It means what it means.,That is not the whole story of why I left.,"Sorry, your time is up.",Wait.,Why then?,What was the reason?,"Ron, come on.","Oh, my God, you made a key?","Ron, please, don't Come on, Ron.","Ron, just talk to me.","Ron, come on!",See you tomorrow morning.,Okay.,Progress.,Is it that I sent you a birthday card through the US mail so the post office knew your address?,No.,Go away.,"Oh, is it because I had Food and Stuff temporarily shut down due to a health code violation?",That was you?,They had fresh produce out right next to the roach spray.,The name of the store is Food and Stuff.,"They sell food, and they sell stuff.","If you don't like it, go to that new place, Complete Food.",It's called Whole Foods.,And is that really the reason?,No.,How many more questions are you going to ask me?,As many as I need to to solve this mystery and get us engaged in a deep and stimulating conversation about our friendship.,"Ron, what are you doing?",I know I saw it.,Ahhah!,Detonator.,The partially defused Claymore mine you gave me 10 years ago.,I'm gonna use it to blow a hole in this damn door so I can get out of here.,"Ron, just wait a second.",No.,"I'm being held as a prisoner against my will, and I have the right, as a citizen of the United States, to blow a hole in that door and walk out as a free man.",It's in the Constitution.,There's no cursing in the Constitution.,"Look, before you do that Too late.",Here we go.,Fire in the hole!,Woohoo!,I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.,You told me this was a genuine partially defused Claymore mine.,"Well, it was.","I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such.",You mean to tell me I have had a toy on my desk for 10 years?,You mean to tell me you've thought you had an actual land mine on your desk?,"Congratulations, Ron.",You've been doing an explosive job!,"Come on, Ron.",It's funny stuff.,Who gets angry at balloons?,Good talk.,What's all this?,"I'm just reading back through some of our old projects, trying to figure out what happened that made you quit.","Good God, woman.",This is a code.,I am going to break it.,And this is my best shot.,Is that nuclear waste?,No.,This is my job application from when you hired me.,How did you get that?,Freedom of Information Act request.,But here's the thing.,I've never read it.,This application contains your very first impressions of me.,"It's the Rosetta Stone, Ron.",The beginning of the whole shebang.,This is all you wrote?,Three lousy lines?,Why would anyone need more than three lines?,"I'm describing a person, not something complicated like a wooden sailing ship or proper dovetail technique.",I forgot what I wrote.,Can I hear it?,Why don't you read it yourself?,"""Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist ""whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky.",""" So far, so accurate.","""If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, ""and it is possible that we would murder each other.",""" You forgot the last sentence.","No, I didn't.",I remember that part.,"It says, ""Hire her.",""" Did you hear that?",It's a person.,It's another person!,Hello!,Hello!,Janitor!,Hey!,"Hey, we're trapped in here!",Hey!,"Please, Mr.",Janitor.,"If you just look over here for two seconds, I'll do anything.",Hey!,I'll watch a foreign film.,I'll talk to a man with a ponytail.,Oh!,"He's gone, Ron.",He's gone.,Why did you give me the job?,And that's what I don't get.,We should've never worked together.,Why did you hire me?,Because of your interview.,"Okay, that doesn't make any sense.","I mean, I remember that interview.",You were wearing that exact outfit.,"And you said to me, ""Ms.","Knope, I have one question for you.","""What do you believe the role of government is in America?",""" You blathered on for 10 minutes about social safety nets and honest governance and improving lives.",Basic nonsense.,"Then you said, ""Everything that just came out of your mouth ""is basic nonsense.","""Good day.",""" And that was it.","No, that was not it.","After I said you were full of it, you got very angry and scrunched up your face and said, ""Excuse me, sir, but I disagree.",""" Did you let me have it?","That was one of your top10 tirades, I'd say.",You were pounding your fist and shaking.,You called me a heartless thug.,I most certainly did not.,"You were tough and honest, and you stood up for what you believed in, even though it might've killed your chance to get the job.",I would rather work with a person like that than with a milquetoast yesman.,Should be one more thing in that file.,"Oh, it's the thankyou note I wrote to you after the interview.",You kept it.,"""Dear Mr.","Swanson, I'm sorry for raising my voice in the interview, ""and I'm sorry I called you a heartless thug.",""" Oh, well, okay.",There you go.,"""If it matters, I promise I would never ""raise my voice at you if we worked together.",""" Liar.","Yeah, I was being really optimistic.","""Please enjoy these homemade brownies ""as a gesture of goodwill.",Leslie Knope.,""" That was the real reason I hired you.",Those brownies were damn good.,"Ron, look how far we've come.",We're doing so great.,"Let's just bring it home, okay?",Let's just talk about our issues.,"Leslie, don't push it.","Okay, fine.","If I guess and guess right, you have to tell me.",Ready?,"Two years ago, you found out you were a quarter French and you had a nervous breakdown.","Okay, playtime is over.",I'm getting out of here once and for all.,"No, Ron!","God, no!",That alarm is just for sprinklers.,April kept pulling it.,So the fire department disconnected it.,I see.,Ron?,I found some towels.,You okay?,Wow.,"Apparently, Craig is studying yoga.",These are the only dry clothes I could find.,"Well, you look great.",I feel extremely angry.,"Oh, come on.","Stop whining, you big baby.",I've seen you with your eyebrows blown off.,I've seen you without a mustache.,I've seen it all.,"There's nowhere to run, Ron.",You have tried every possible means of escape.,There's nothing to do but talk.,What happened to these workplace proximity associates?,Hmm?,Spill it.,You left.,"Then a month later, you took Terry with you.","Yeah, well, we needed a mindless factotum, and he's the best there is.",Amen.,Then you took April.,"I didn't want her to go, as she had become one of my closest workplace acquaintances.",But your offer was too good to pass up.,So I didn't try to stop her.,Then Tom left to run his business.,Donna left to run hers.,"One day, I looked up.", Just didn't recognize anyone., So I made a decision., An unthinkable decision., Hey.," Well, my, my, my."," Do my eyes deceive me? Is that Ron Swanson? Hello, Leslie."," Hello, April.", Larry.," Uh, It's Terry now.", Okay., As luck would have it One second.," Did you talk to Randy about the vote? Tell the Northeast that we need to put pressure on them, or else we're gonna be waiting forever, and I'm tired of waiting on them, okay? Okay."," Sorry, this is a crazy day."," So what's up with you, you big lug? Nothing important.", Just thought you might want to have lunch., Tomorrow? I would love to., It's been too long.," JJ's Diner, 12:30? Excellent.", See you then., Okay.," So Randy says the House is voting tomorrow, and they need us in Washington to prep."," Oh, my God, really? Yeah."," Okay, get us the first flight out of here and grab the Missouri files.", Meet me at my car.," Hey, babe.", I got to go to Washington.," Can you pick up the kids? Oh Oh, no."," Ron, I stood you up for lunch."," You did, yes."," I waited for a while, but it was pretty easy to figure out what had happened.", Your life seemed pretty hectic., Is that the rest of the story? That I stood you up? You were going to ask me something., That's why you wanted to have lunch.," Ron, you were going I was gonna ask you for a job.", In the federal government., Just saying it out loud feels dirty.," You missed your friends, and you wanted to come up to the third floor and work with us again.", I can't even imagine how hard that must have been for you.," God, why didn't I see that? Ron, I am so sorry.", I should've been a better friend to you.," Honestly, Leslie, it's fine.", It was a punctuation mark on a sentence that had already been written., My time in government work was over.," Sure, I loved shutting things down and bleeding the rotting beast from the inside.", Your metaphors are so beautiful.," But it was time for me to leave, and I didn't feel like explaining why to you or anyone."," Everything that happened after, the fight we had, not giving you a heads-up when my company took on the Morningstar development and bulldozed the nurse's old house, I do regret that.", I had a good run here.," But after you and Tom and Donna and April and Terry left, when I looked around this office, nothing was the same."," Yeah, well, there's a way to fix that."," England's got a new queen Everybody's really mean We didn't start the fire It was always burning Since the world's been turning Well, this is different from what I expected to find."," Morning, guys."," Good morning, Leslie."," What did you do to the office? Ron, you're wearing my yoga clothes.", You're gonna stretch out the elastic., We're sorry., Fire and money and people Hey.," I moved our meetings to tomorrow because you are drunk and hungover simultaneously at Yeah, good call."," Also, you have a visitor."," No, whoever it is, I have zero interest in Hello."," Ron! Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron, Ron."," We just spent 12 hours together, woman.", Don't care., I have three years' worth of hugs to force upon you against your will., I have a small object for you.," Call it an official peace offering, I suppose."," Wow, this is very sweet.", But you do realize I gave you this picture six hours ago., The frame is the gift.," When my company took on the Morningstar development, and I realized it meant bulldozing Ann's old house, I salvaged her front door.", Then I stripped off all the terrible paint and lacquer People really don't know how to finish wood properly., And I made it into this frame for you in the event that you and I ever Ron.," You big, fat, giant sap.", That seems unnecessary., I love it., But I feel bad., I don't have anything for you.," For the first time in my life, I am present-less.", How about you buy me a meal? You hungry? I'm starving.," April, Ron and I are going to JJ's to eat too much breakfast food."," Why does anybody in the world ever eat anything but breakfast food? People are idiots, Ron.",   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 05,Forget it.,It's impossible.,It's not gonna work in a million years.,It's pointless.,I give up.,"Good attitude, honey.","Well, you know, what do you want from me?",I'm trying to get a group of people to give me their land rather than sell it to Gryzzl for $90 million.,"Right now, my basic argument is, ""Please give us the land.",It would be so nice.,""" Gryzzl has billions of dollars.",There's no way I beat them.,Hey.,I've seen you beat tougher odds than this.,They're just a company.,They're not that powerful.,Whoa!,"""Open your door?",""" Ah!","Oh, my God!","Ben, we're about to die!",Good lord.,"Oh, my The robots have come for us.",I made fun of you when you said it would happen but your novel has come true.,"Hey, Leslie Knope.","Please enjoy this free gift, courtesy of Gryzzl.","Okay, so, they also have a squadron of flying robots giving presents to everyone.",Later!,We're screwed.,"Mmm New dish we're working on, tell me what you think.","It's a red and white heirloom red bean pasta, with an imported Tuscan walnut herb sauce infused with shaved heritage Pecorino Romano.","What, you're done?",Mmm.,Really good.,Why are you doing new dishes?,"Lucy is visiting her boyfriend, Conrad, in Chicago.",So I'm just trying to distract myself with work so I don't think about the marathon bone sex they're probably having.,"Hey, you know what, dude, you gotta take your mind off them.",Check this out.,It's a contract.,"It came from the station manager where I do my show, Johnny Karate.","He wants me to sign it, but it says that they'll own the character Johnny Karate.","And I want to own the character Johnny Karate, 'cause it's me.","Wait, this says they only pay you 100 bucks a week?","Yeah, but all I really do is goof around all day, write, produce and direct a TV show.","Plus, I act in it, I do sets, props, wardrobe.",At the end I drive everybody home.,"So, I mean, 100 bucks a week, that's pretty fair.",This is perfect.,I'll be your agent.,I'll put all my energy into renegotiating your contract.,I won't even think about Lucy and Conrad and his stupid crunches that he probably does.,I should probably do some crunches.,Let's go.,"Andy, my tumtum!","Knope, I need to talk to you.",What's up?,"I know I technically work for Gryzzl, but these fools have crossed a line.",Have you gotten one of these Gryzzl boxes?,"Well, yeah, but I haven't opened it yet.",Planning on sending it back after I wrote a sternly worded letter about how I cannot be bought with free gifts.,These are my free gifts.,Two honey bears and a canister of sugar plums.,Honeybear and Sugar Plum are the special names Joe and I call each other.,Aww!,"Yeah, we're adorable, but this is creepy.",Because we only call each other these things on the phone or in texts.,How do they even know?,"Leslie, open that box they sent you.",Ooh!,"Joe Biden's book, Biden the Rails, 1,001 Poems Inspired by My Travels through Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.",A thousand?,A poster of the Supreme Court Justices sipping the Friends milkshake!,This stuff is perfect for me.,"Yeah, exactly.",They must be datamining.,Searching our texts and emails and gathering profiles on all of us.,"This is a huge invasion of privacy, not to mention illegal.","When they installed their free WiFi in town, I made sure that there was language preventing this.",I never would have agreed to work with them if I had known they were gonna be snoopin' in my biz.,Gryzzl is going down.,"You wanna put me on blast, I'm gonna put you on front street.",I don't understand what that means but I think I get the context and I love it!,"April, the new Parks interns start today, and I was wondering if you would deliver a little welcome speech.",No.,Go away.,"Watermelon martinis, exposed brick, Keri Russell's hair.",Why did you just say those weird things?,"On the advice of my therapist, Dr.","Richard Nygard, whenever I feel like yelling, I just take a deep breath and say three great things about being alive.",Gross.,Please talk to my interns.,Fine.,Whatever.,I'll do it.,"I started here when I was 20, and now I'm old and gross and directionless.","Those kids are me 10 years ago, and this internship is the videotape from The Ring.","It's too late for me, I've seen too much, but maybe I can save them.",You're all gonna die in here!,"Hello, everyone.",We are here today to discuss Gryzzl and whether or not they are invading our privacy.,They sent my husband three boxes of genital cream to his office.,"My husband's splotchy genitals are no one's business except for his, mine, and his many genital doctors.",They sent me a bunch of toy pigs dressed like movie stars.,That's my private hobby.,No one knows I collect toy pigs dressed like movie stars.,Except now all of you people.,Which one is that?,This is actually Hamuel L.,Jackson from the movie Pork Fiction.,"It's extremely rare, and I am keeping it.","But still, they have no right to give me something I will treasure the rest of my life.",I opened my box in front of all my friends and it was a bunch of Virginia Woolf novels.,Now Miley and Haley know I like to read!,What if they tell Evan?,"I like their phones, but they've gone too far, sending this stuff to our houses.",Gryzzl has no right to search our private data.,"So, wait.",You guys are not against us on this?,We're not against you on this.,We're not against you on this!,We're not against you on this!,"Finally, after months of searching for a way to defeat Gryzzl, we have found its Achilles' heel.",The town is behind us.,Donna is on our side.,And the next domino to fall?,Ron Swanson.,"Actually, this is Tom Selloink, but, you know, close enough.","Actually, I'm gonna need that back.","Oh, yes, of course.",February 2016.,I think you're gonna really enjoy this month's photo album.,"It includes such hits as first trip to the dentist, Sonia tries pizza, and waterpark vomit chain reaction.",Why would you take pictures of that?,Why would you not?,"As you requested, here is a picture of my son, at a recent moment in his life.",So cute What are you doing?,Protecting my son's privacy.,"What, I'm just gonna carry around pictures of my child, where anyone could see them?","Well, it's funny you should mention privacy, because that's our next topic.","Ron technically works for Gryzzl, and when he finds out what Gryzzl is doing, he is going to lose his mind.",I have no reaction to this.,What?,"I do not pass judgment on the workings of private businesses, I just build their buildings.","And frankly, if people are foolish enough to carry around a doodad that lets Gryzzl track their every move, this is what they get.",But it's illegal.,I don't believe that's true.,"I've spent a fair amount of time with Gryzzl's highpriced lawyers, and they do seem to, as they say, ""Keep it 100.",""" Well, those fools still think I work for them.","So, I can get you a private VIP tour of the building, maybe you can snoop around.","Hey there, homies, I'm Roscoe.",Psyched to give you guys a tour.,"Yes, hello.","I'm Darlene Johannsen, and this is my assistantturnedlover, Gregory Strong.","Ours is a new romance, but one that sent shockwaves through my architecture firm.",But it feels so right.,Steady.,We love Gryzzl and we would love to see how it all works.,Sweet.,Let's get loco.,"Okay, so, let's get to know each other.","Talk about why you're here, whether you're throwing your lives away, stuff like that.","You, what brought you here?",I love the Parks Department.,I grew up near Ramsett Park and I used to go to tons of stuff there.,Okay.,That doesn't help me.,Mork?,"Oh, It's Mike.",I love parks more than anything.,And I've been a summer camp counselor since I was 13.,Ugh!,Gross.,What about you?,Why are you here?,The only thing I love more than parks is recreation.,Really?,No.,I just needed a college credit.,What are you studying?,Nothing.,College is stupid.,Then who made you do this?,My parents.,What are they like?,"Well, my mom's the devil and my dad's a dumb doctor.",My dad's a doctor.,Shut up.,"Jen, is it?",Yeah.,"Let's take a walk, Jen.",I feel like you have almost zero potential.,I think that's cool.,"And, action.","We meet again, PuppyHating Dan.",You stole my guitar.,And you put farts in my lunch!,You've really done it this time.,"Puppy Army, attack!",Yeah!,What?,No!,I hate puppies!,I'll admit to everything!,"You win again, Macklin!",Another mystery solved!,We'll be right back after this with some more Johnny Karate.,"Hey, that's lunch everyone.",We're back in 30 minutes.,"Great job, bud.",You crushed it.,I love being Andy's agent.,"He does all the work, and I get 10% just for showing up.","It's like a chef at a restaurant making all the food and then the owner gets the profit, which is my other job.","Man, I really got things figured out.",Let's make this quick.,Andy's show gets huge ratings in three cities.,His GryzzlTube page has millions of views.,"If you don't want Andy walking over to your rival station in Snerling, I think you should start taking this seriously.","Okay, here's what we're gonna do.",I'm gonna upgrade the parking spot.,"But my son gets a role as one of the kid ninjas, all right?",He's gonna love me for it.,It's gonna drive my exwife crazy.,"So far, so good.","But, in the words of Jerry Maguire ""The human head weighs 8 pounds.",""" No.","""Show me the money.",""" Andy, do you know how lucky you are to work here?",I'm a kingmaker.,"Pip Wiley, Chuck Warschank, Selena Gomez.",I made them.,You discovered Selena Gomez?,Different Selena Gomez.,"Look, I don't have the money for a raise.","Uh Yeah, you do.",I've seen profit reports.,The show is a bonanza.,Andy starts making $500 a week.,Now.,Get the hell out of my office.,Sit down.,"Look, dude, this internship leads nowhere.",It'll just screw up the rest of your life.,What do you love doing?,Texting.,What did you wanna be when you were little?,A scary mermaid that lures sailors to their death.,"Okay, side note, I'm gonna file papers to adopt you as my child, so keep an eye out for that.","But more importantly, don't do this internship.","Go do something fun, like trying to control birds with your mind, or posting Internet comments as Michael Jackson's ghost.",Okay.,Maybe you're right.,Thanks.,"Hey, April!",We finished those questionnaires you gave us about our hopes and dreams for the internship.,Great.,"Thanks, Mike.",I'm sorry this building is so lame.,"As soon as we get our new headquarters built, it's gonna be way, way tighter.",Check it.,Matty.,"Okay, this is GryzzlVibe.",It's this new app that we're developing that monitors your mood.,Tell them about it.,"As you know, the cameras on your phones are always on, whether you're using them or not.",I'm sorry?,They are?,This app uses facialrecognition software to track your expressions.,It's always watching.,"Well, what do you do with this information?","Well, if the camera senses that you're in a bad mood, then we could geomatch you to, say, the nearest cup of sweet pickmeup java.","But, if you're in a good mood, then we could geonudge you to, like, a sweet coffee shop.",You could just keep the good times rolling.,So it's really just a coffee sales app.,Yeah.,"Yeah, we're developing with Starbucks.",Yeah.,"So, Roscoe, how does Gryzzl know all the things that someone wants?","Are you guys, I don't know, whatever, datamining?","Oh, hells yeah, dogman!","Our super rad algorithm searches all your texts, calls, banking, medical records, blah, blah, blah, to learn what you really want.","You know, from snacks, to new books and movies, to when you ladies need to score some new 'pons.","I mean, we might know you better than you know yourself, Leslie.",How did you know it was me?,It was about 40 different ways.,"I mean, geomaps on all your different Gryzzl devices.","And, of course, we facescanned you when you came in.",We're really glad you're here.,"Okay, good.",Just 'cause we're competing for the Newport land doesn't mean that we can't be friends.,No.,Isn't that your motto?,"""Wouldn't it be tight if everyone was chill to each other?",""" Totes.",And I hope that you can see now that there's nothing scary about Gryzzl.,"I mean, we just wanna learn everything about everyone, and track them wherever they go, and anticipate what they're about to do.","These are really interesting issues, Roscoe.","I think maybe we could debate them, you know, on TV.",TV.,Retro.,I love it.,All right.,I'm gonna GryzzlPad out of here.,Skate mode activated.,"Later, chillers.","This is The Perdples Court, a legal debate show about issues facing residents of Southern Indiana.","With your host, Judge Perd Hapley.","Tonight on The Perdples Court, we will have the guests that have been booked for tonight's show.","The plaintiff, Leslie Knope, who has some big allegations against Gryzzl.","The defendant, Gryzzl Vice President Roscoe Santangelo.",Who will win?,I don't know yet.,Which is what makes this a court show.,"We have public opinion on our side, and we have proof that Gryzzl has been datamining.",But there's one more thing we need.,The one thing that Americans respect more than anything else.,Public humiliation on live television.,"Leslie, do not go on television.",Swanson?,What are you doing here?,This is the 27th version of the PawneeGryzzl free wireless Internet thing agreement.,Check out the page I marked.,Yeah.,Gryzzl is not allowed to collect and use customer data for any purposes.,It's pretty clear.,See?,Look closer.,"Amendment C, addendum 14.","It directs you to this appendix, which reroutes you to this one, which says, in a subfootnote It says here they can gather and use any information they want.",How did I miss this?,Look at the revision date.,"December 18th, 2015.",That was the opening day of Episode VII.,You were muttering that date in your sleep for months.,They knew you'd be distracted.,That's how they slipped it in.,I did this to the town.,It's my fault.,It's Ice Town all over again.,Is Star Wars the one with the little wizard boy?,"Okay, this is what I can give you.","No more janitorial duties, better parking spot, unlimited Mike and Ikes from the vending machine, and for salary, we're at $500 a week.","Dollars, man.",What about the rights to Johnny Karate?,We own the rights to Johnny Karate.,I can't bend on that one.,But I invented the character.,"Well, invent another character.","Uh Here you go, KungFu Billy.",Jeremy PunchGuy.,Ed Kick.,Those are actually pretty great.,But Johnny Karate is special to me.,"If we can't get the rights, I'm gonna walk.",He's making the biggest mistake of his life.,He's walking out on Hank Muntak?,I have six Lower Great Lakes Emmy Awards.,I once sat in the original Batmobile.,James Woods follows my niece on Twitter.,He's gonna regret this.,"All of this work, everything I've done for this city, it's all a wash now.",Everyone's gonna hate me again.,"Some of us are already there, Wyatt.",This is not your fault.,"Ron, talk some sense into him.",Ben's right.,This is Ice Town all over again.,Ron!,"If you're gonna sign a legally binding document, you need to read it thoroughly.",That's why the only contract I've ever signed was my Mulligan's Steakhouse Club Card.,"And even then, I used a fake name.",Les.,Les Vegetables.,"Don't worry, okay?",You're not gonna take the fall for this.,"Ron, make sure that Donna doesn't hurt him.",You wanted to see me?,Yes.,Can you tell me where Jennifer is?,I convinced her to quit.,"Martha Stewart's apron line, my tomato plants Oh, God, I'm out.",Where's my emergency list?,"Recently I've been feeling like I've wasted the last 10 years of my life, and it all started with this internship.","And I don't want those kids to make the same mistake, okay?","April, you spent the last 10 years doing amazing things with this Parks Department, and learning from the greatest teacher in this or any business, Leslie Freaking Knope.",You'd be a checkout girl at a gas station if it wasn't for that internship!,"Sweet potato pie, unlikely animal friend pairings, Jennifer Love Hewitt.","You're lucky to have worked here, no matter what you wanna do with the rest of your life.",And I think you know that.,"And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go find a new intern.","Now, Leslie, I understand that what you've brought to the show isn't a box of objects, but rather a symbolic box of allegations.","Well, Perd It's Judge Perd.",Okay.,I think there are certain questions about certain aspects of certain parts of this situation that require an evaluation about whether or not this is or is not a valid argument.,Extremely wellput.,"Excuse me, Judge Perd.","I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager.","What Gryzzl is doing with our private information may not technically be illegal, but it's definitely not chill.",Whoa!,"That's a serious allegaysh, homie.",We are hella chill.,"And frankly, if you don't like our vibe, you don't have to use our shizz."," Well, we kind of do."," I mean, the Internet is no longer optional.", It's a necessity for everyone.," And I think you do know that data-mining isn't chill, because you snuck it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement.", A person should not have to have an advanced law degree to avoid being taken advantage of by a multi-billion-dollar company., You should be upfront about what you're doing and allow people the ability to opt out.," To be honest, Judge Perd is stumped by this case.", I've also misplaced my judge hammer., I cannot render a verdict here.," Therefore, I must declare a mistrial, which is a term I've heard people use in the movies."," Tap, tap, tap.", Case ended., And we're clear., All right.," Later, dudes."," Hey, good news.", I think I found a job., There was an opening for a janitor at the TV station.," Get this, they're gonna pay me the minimum wage."," Put your mop down, bud.", I got you the rights to Johnny Karate., No way.," How? Just a great agent, I guess."," Please, man, please! Andy's my friend and I want to do a good job, and there's this girl I really like and she lives in Chicago.", And she's still dating someone.," Oh, God.", Do you wanna eat at my restaurant for free? Every week., You can come once a week., It's free.," Hey, okay.", Fine., Just stop., See? I told you it was gonna work out., That's actually really good advice for anything.," If there's something that you want badly, you just have to believe that it's gonna work out.", Hey., I am sorry that I screwed up your life., I found a bunch of new potential interns to replace Jen., Hi.," How'd you manage that? I just thought, ""What would Leslie do?"" So I handed out flyers and I canvassed the college.", I even baked a bunch of cookies., It was weird., I actually really enjoyed finding them., And I enjoyed bullying Jen into quitting., Hmm., You should add telling people what to do to your perfect job description., Good idea.," You should up your therapy to seven times a week, stop dressing that way and give me your wallet."," Victor Garber, James Garner, Jennifer Garner.", I go alphabetical now., Hey! You're back., How was the trip? It was okay., Kind of weird.," Weird couple of days for me, too."," Closed a bunch of deals, did a bunch of crunches Yeah.", I broke up with Conrad., Which was a long time coming but it's still weird., Yeah., Do you want to talk about it? Thanks., I don't think I'm ready to discuss it just yet., But what I would like to do is have a glass of wine and talk about that shade Nicki Minaj threw at Jesse Eisenberg at the BAFTAs., He deserved it.," No, he didn't! Uh Settle in.", Because I have some very strong feelings about this., They're all down., Thank God., Sometimes I think they're somehow the first humans who don't need sleep., Look.," This Gryzzl thing, it's complicated, but this isn't Ice Town."," You have done so much for this town, and people know that.", I'm just sorry we couldn't find something illegal on Gryzzl.," If we're gonna stop them, and you're gonna beat them on the Newport land, we need more ammo.", We need to talk., What is that? This is a flying robot I just shot out of the sky after it delivered a package to my house., I thought you didn't like to pass judgment on The package was addressed to my son., Who is four years old and does not own a Gryzzl doodad., Somehow the robots looked at Diane's computer and learned something about my child and then brought him a box of presents., So I destroyed the robot., No one is safe from these bastards.," Tell me what to do, Leslie.", I wanna help you take 'em down.,   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 06,In front of you are six different wedding cakes from the top restaurants in Pawnee.,"Sample each one, and rank your two top favorites in the ballots provided.","Oh, boy.","They're all so good, I can't pick just two.","Well, then you leave, Terry.",And pay for the cake you already ate.,I like the vanilla one with the lemon cream.,"That was a joke cake I got from the grocery store, to weed out lowquality palates.","Maybe it's because he's my fianc and I love him, but I kind of like the grocery store one, too.",There's actually one more cake you haven't tried yet.,Donna has chosen me to be the Butler of Honor at her wedding.,"Now, granted, ""Butler of Honor"" is a term I made up, but it's not a job I take lightly.",That's why I'm about to give her a surprise bigger than when LeBron went back to Miami.,"Oh, my God.",DJ Bluntz?,What is happening right now?,I think you know what's happening.,"But but for real, though.",What what's happening?,Treat Yo' Self.,Treat Yo' Self 2017!,"Oh, my God!",Is this for real?,"Oh, it's for real.",And it's the biggest one yet.,I still don't know what's happening.,"So, what's happening?",Treat Yo' Self!,Not an answer to my question.,"Oh, my God, read the cake.",Still unclear.,"Terry, what's happening?",Treat Yo' Self.,It's the best day of the year!,"Roscoe, people in this town are very angry about Gryzzl's data mining program.","In your opinion, have you done anything wrong?","We did not believe that we did anything to invade people's privacy, Trodd.","But then, we checked thousands of emails and texts between our customers and their loved ones, and it seemed like people thought we were wrong.",Gryzzl's currently trying to buy an enormous parcel of land to build a permanent headquarters in Pawnee.,How will you win back our trust?,We are gonna be throwing a free concert with U2 and Beyonc.,"Tickets are already on your phones, seating is gonna be organized by income and sexual history.","And that, I swear, is the last time that we will be peeking inside your computers.","Wow, Gryzzl is scrambling.","And for the first time in this land battle, they are vulnerable and we are gonna capitalize on it with something big and exciting.",I've got something big and exciting.,All we need is a blimp and a decoy blimp.,Okay.,"For what I hope is the last time, but we'll assume is not the last time, our strategy does not involve blimps.",We already have an idea.,April?,Okay.,Our new proposal will ask them to split the land.,Gryzzl will take half for their campus and then donate the rest to National Parks.,"It's not ideal, but they may go for it because of how bad they screwed up.","I am not a spy, and I would never reveal classified information.",Do you have to say that every time?,Yes.,But I know Gryzzl is dead set on owning the entire parcel.,I'm not sure this plan will work.,"Well, if it doesn't, something will.","Because when you and I team up, great things happen.","Ron and I had a little falling out, but we are back, baby.","And just like Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, we are totally in sync.",Come on.,Okay.,Just give me a We're in sync emotionally.,Stop patting my head.,Huh.,Looks like Newport Trust is making an announcement.,"Last week, the Newport Trust told Gryzzl, in no uncertain terms, that we would not do business with a company that invades our privacy.","Then, Gryzzl upped their offer to $125 million, and I swear to God, y'all, I nearly fainted.",So we are officially jumping the gun and selling to Gryzzl for $125 million.,What?,Let me repeat that because it makes me very horny.,"C'mon, Knope.",$125 million.,How about we go drown our sorrows in some waffles?,"Treat Yo' Self Hey, boss.","Before you go, can you sign some checks?",Do mine first.,"In case something happens to you, I wanna make sure I get paid.",Looking out for number one.,Always smart.,"So, how is postbreakup life?","Well, breakups are famously super fun and make everyone feel awesome.","So, it's no different.",You should come to my wedding.,It's gonna be hella fun.,"Yeah, you should come with me.","As, like, a plusone type thing.",Maybe we just go as work friends.,"Maybe it's just even, you know, bossemployee type thing.",You know what?,That's what you should do.,You should come to the wedding And do paperwork.,"Stop, you're making this sound almost too fun.","Whatever, just text me when you decide.",I literally couldn't care less.,"So, yeah.","Let's hit it, Donna.","Um, can we talk about that disastrous interaction you just had with Lucy?",Nope.,All we're talking about is treating yo' self.,Today is about one thing.,Things.,"Things, Donna!",Our favorite.,"Well, where is Bluntz taking us?",This is not the way to the mall.,That's 'cause we're not going to the mall.,We're finally gonna do something we've always talked about.,No way.,Treat Yo' Self.,In Beverly Hills!,All I wanted was valued at $100 million given to me for free.,Is that too much to ask?,I'll say it again.,Voodoo is still an option.,No.,It's over.,They won.,Everything is changing.,This town is gonna be unrecognizable in 10 years.,Even JJ's Diner is disappearing.,What can I get you guys?,However many waffles it takes to keep you in business.,I'm happy with some of the changes that Pawnee has gone through.,"I mean, the standard of living is up, we have pressed juice bars, and yoga studios, and a pet hotel.",But I think the town is losing some of its charm.,And there's too much kale now.,One place asked me if I wanted kale in my milkshake.,"My milkshake, you guys.","Even though I'm a firm believer in the free market, and your failure as a businessman is ultimately to blame, it's still a travesty your diner is closing.","Well, I agree with you.",But the guy who bought the property didn't even give me a chance to reup the lease.,Can't win 'em all.,No.,Enough is enough.,"They may have taken that land, but I will be damned if they take my waffles.",JJ.,What?,Is something wrong?,"No, nothing is ever wrong here.",That's why we are gonna fight hard to save your diner.,"Now, you said your new landlord didn't give you a chance to counter.",Who is it?,It was a company with a weirdsounding name.,Hang on.,Was it Putin?,"Voldemort Putin, of Russia?",I'd love to take that bastard down.,Here it is.,"""Thigh Gap, LLC ""Owner, Dennis Feinstein.",""" The cologne guy?","Ugh, figures.",That guy is the worst.,Okay.,We are gonna take him down with an oldfashioned public rally.,"April, I need you to get the word out, with whatever method of communication young people are using these days.","Oh, yeah.",Tiny rolledup scrolls delivered by trained foxes.,I'm on it.,"Andy, you thinking what I'm thinking?","Oh, hell, yeah.",Blimp time.,No.,I think this is a job for Jonathan Karate.,Awesome.,Even better.,"Ron, what do you say?",Dynamic duo get together one more time to try to save JJ's Diner?,I can't think of anything more noble to go to war over than bacon and eggs.,"Hear, hear.","Oh, well.","Well, we'll keep practicing.","All right, everybody, listen up.",We're here today because JJ's Diner has been a part of Pawnee for 41 years.,"And this man, right here, built that diner from the ground up, with his own two hands.",That's not true.,"It's called ""constructing a narrative,"" JJ.","You stick to the breakfast, I'll deal with the politics.","So, now, let's hear from a man who knows the value of things staying the same.",Ron Swanson.,I do not like rallies.,"And based on what I see from this vantage point, I do not like most of you.",What I do like is breakfast food.,"JJ's has very good breakfast food, so it should remain open.",Please do not approach me on the street after this event and attempt to talk to me.,Our similarities begin and end with this single issue.,Ron Swanson.,Can I help you?,Yes.,We are here to see Dennis Feinstein.,The appointment should be under Karate.,Jonathan Karate.,"Um, I don't see a ""Jonathan Karate"" anywhere.",Exactly.,"Occasionally on my show, we deal with real issues like bullying, peer pressure, or holding in farts.","In those very special episodes, I become Jonathan Karate, the very serious older brother of Johnny Karate.",Jonathan Karate tells it like it is.,He makes people do the right thing.,"Oh, baby.",That feels amazing.,"But I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to go.",I have to meet Rick and TC at the King Kamehameha Club.,Higgins is missing.,Dennis Feinstein.,What?,Who's that?,My name is Jonathan Karate.,We need to talk.,"Well, make it quick.",I gotta go pull the plug on my dad in 10 minutes.,I heard you were buying JJ's Diner and kicking everybody out.,That's true.,Real estate prices in this turd town are through the roof.,I'm gonna turn that place into an elbow art salon and make a killing.,"Plus, who's gonna miss some dumpy diner?",Why don't you ask the people gathering outside of your building right now?,Hmm?,What do we want?,Breakfast!,When do we want it?,Forever!,I had no idea this place was so loved.,This could be bad for business.,Then come with me.,Tell the people that JJ's can stay.,Okay.,"Plus, you should get these kids out of here.","Not to brag, but my colognes have been known to stunt human growth, so Ninjas!",Scatter.,When do we want it?,Forever!,What do we want?,Breakfast!,You got 'em well trained.,Treat Yo' Self in Beverly Hills Donna.,Donna.,Donna.,"Can we get one right here, please?",Right here.,Right here.,"Ladies and gentleman, off to our right, you can see the house that belongs to Bruce Willis and Christina Aguilera.",And to our left is Usher's Los Angeles residence.,Usher's house!,Usher's star!,"So, for the basic elbow bedazzling, it's 140.",Custom art starts at 250.,I would like three bigass diamonds surrounded by their own set of tinyass diamonds.,"That would fall into our supreme collection, 600.","Thomas, what do you suggest?",Uh Treat yo' self.,"Trish, the gentleman is right.",I'm gonna go ahead and treat myself.,LASIK for fingernails?,I came up with that.,You want it?,It's 275.,Yeah.,"Laser my nails off, please.",We can't bulldoze our entire history.,We need to preserve the things that make Pawnee great.,Like JJ's Diner.,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!","Whoa, whoa, whoa!",Stop the clock.,"Oh, speak of the devil.","Ladies and gentlemen, the devil, Dennis Feinstein.",Hey now.,Hang on.,"Now, Leslie, I think everybody's gonna wanna hear what I have to say.",Thank you.,"People of Pawnee, I just came down here to tell you how much I appreciate your passion.",You've been heard loud and clear.,You convinced me.,JJ's can stay.,Yeah!,"I just have one more thing to say, Pawnee.",Psych!,Do you think I care about how much you love this stupid diner?,I bought it for a song and I'm gonna sell it for a mint and you can all just sit there pulling on your puds.,"Oh, yeah.",Give me your boos!,I am nourished by your hatred!,"I should also let you know, you are all trespassing on private property.",Release the Hounds!,What hounds?,The Hounds is an FDArejected cologne I've been working on that makes everything smell like wet dog.,Make it rain!,Ooh!,I gotta go kill my dad.,Let's go.,"I am sorry, JJ, that I gave you false hope.","This is a lost cause, just like my stupid park.",Screw that.,There's gotta be another way.,"What if we steal the keys to Feinstein's building, break in, and TP his office, film the whole thing.",We'd definitely get on a prank show.,"Okay, I love your energy, Andy, but it's not gonna help us keep JJ's where it is.",Does it have to stay where it is?,"There's, like, a ton of buildings near where Andy and I live, and they're all super cheap because they're empty and disgusting.",Great!,I'm in.,Anything to get away from this cologne smell.,Ooh.,Water makes it worse.,Water makes it worse.,This is the hottest restaurant in LA.,All the sushi is made from fish previously owned by celebrities.,"Okay, this is Charlize Theron's yellowtail, here we have Paul Reiser's salmon, and Peter Bogdanovich's saltwater eel.",Enjoy.,Mmm!,Bogdanodelish.,"Man, you got it bad.",I know you're checking your phone every five minutes to see if Lucy will come with you to my wedding.,I'm sorry.,"Hey, I understand.",Which is why I got you something.,"Hey, you're not supposed to get me anything.",This is your special day.,I didn't buy you anything.,What I have for you is a piece of advice.,"Oh, damn.",I was secretly hoping you got me the shoes Jaden Smith wears Son of a Hitch.,"My advice to you is, if you want to be with Lucy, you have to be upfront with her about it.",Be a man and ask her out.,She works for me.,She uprooted her whole life to move to Pawnee for this job.,I don't want to make it weird.,And what if she says no?,What if I'm the only one that caught feelings?,You won't know until you ask.,"Basically, Tommy, when it comes to matters of the heart, I say, ""Treat yo' self.",""" Thanks, Donna, it's a great gift.",I almost forgot.,I did get you them shoes from Hitch 2!,"Oh, snap!",That's an even better gift!,That's not all.,"Look behind you, but don't be obvious.","Can I get the ""me"" soft shell crab?",Josh Groban!,He's eating his own sushi!,That's the most baller thing I've ever seen!,"Welcome to Beachview Terrace, the sad, unsalvageable, brokendown armpit of Pawnee.",Yeah.,We tried to clean up this neighborhood so many times.,Nothing's worked.,"We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago, raccoons ate the wheels right off it.","Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and 10 years ago, when he was elected, he promised to clean it up.","Instead, he just gave it a fancy new name, Beachview Terrace.",A more accurate name for this place?,Medical Waste ButtSweat Grove.,"Hi, sorry I'm late.",We've had this listing for seven years and no one's ever asked to see it.,I thought this was a prank call.,This place has everything.,"Vermin, bullet holes, a hornet's nest.","Look, I appreciate everything that you guys have done for me, but even if I put in the time and the money to refurbish this trash heap, it's not gonna change the fact that no respectable people live in this part of town anymore.",Damn straight.,Everything would have to magically change.,"The whole neighborhood would have to suddenly become safe and clean, and have businesses and people who dine out.","No, then we'd have to move again.",Are you thinking It's possible.,But how would we PR.,PR.,Which you could then Yes.,Right.,"Okay, good.","Guys, we have about five days to do three months' worth of work, but if we pull it off, we can rescue JJ's Diner, we can establish a new national park, and we can save Pawnee forever.",Who's in?,I am.,"Oh, my God.",Where'd you come from?,The floor hole.,Hey!,How was your trip?,"Great, obviously.",Bedazzled that elbow.,How was everything here?,Uneventful.,"So, I was thinking about the idea of going to Donna's wedding.","Wait, before you say anything.",I don't think you should go to Donna's wedding to supervise catering.,Oh.,"I want you to come with me, as my date.",Oh!,"The thing is, you work for me, so it's probably kind of uncool for me to even ask.",Which is why I signed these documents transferring daytoday operations of Tom's Bistro over to Craig.,He'll be your boss now., Not me., It's about time.," We're losing the cranberry salad, effective immediately! You don't have to do this."," Yeah, I do."," You're great at your job, and I want you working here forever, and if you don't have feelings for me, I need you to know that everything is gonna be fine."," In fact, forget it.", I wasn't even serious., You've been hoaxed! You've been Tommy-ed! Just hold on., I was gonna say that I wouldn't wanna go with you as friends., I wanna go with you as your date., Oh., Cool.," Craig, never mind.", You can rip these papers up.," Well, I wish my reign had lasted longer, but I'm happy with the decisions I made and the people I fired."," Oh, God.", I'd better get back there.," You guys, I don't know what this is about, but it's 4:13, so you got seven minutes."," Well, we just wanted to introduce you to the new home of the Gryzzl campus.", Are you tripping? We just spent $125 million to build our new campus in the Southern Indiana Foothills.," And you'll be spending another $100 million, at least, to construct the building, roads, plumbing, electrical."," Whereas here at Beachview Terrace, you can take over five entire square blocks of historic Pawnee.", Here's a complete proposal for Gryzzl's new regional corporate headquarters., Is this paper? Super throwback., My company inspected all the buildings.," They are disgusting, I grant you, but the guts are solid."," We've laid out construction costs, retail space options."," You could build a much bigger campus in this neighborhood, and basically break even."," Plus, the best part, all the buildings come pre-graffitied.", That's true., We wouldn't have to hire Banksy.," Okay, but we spent hella skrilla on this trill forest.", So what are we supposed to do with that? Here's a far-out idea that just came to the top of my brainium., Why don't you donate that land to the National Park Service? That would be pretty dope., And you could get some baller tax breaks that could help you with that mad stank construction cost., I don't know.," I'm sorry, I can't."," I can't say these words Okay, but why couldn't we just build the campus here, and then keep the land or sell it? You could.", But donating it will give you some good PR., Which you desperately need.," I mean, look, we are glad that you picked Pawnee, but if you're gonna set up shop here, you need to make a covenant with the city.", Show people that you're invested in this town.," Start by cleaning up one part of Pawnee, and preserving the other."," Okay, well, I gotta talk to my board, as well as our chief legal counsel and our senior advisory team."," And truthfully, they're all shrooming super hard at Coachella right now."," But as soon as they get back, I'll get into it."," We gotta go, I'm sorry.", We got a meeting., I'll catch you guys later., I've got a meeting as well., See you back at the house., Andy has a meeting? Upload it to my GryzzlGlass., Left eye., I'm watching porn with my right eye., Who did this? We did.," One way or another, Jonathan Karate always gets his man."," And like that, they were gone."," Go! Wait, where's Hey, guys, where's Gavin? Gav? Wait, stop.", There were supposed to be six ninjas.," Where's Gavin? Gavin? Who was Gavin's buddy? Caleb, come on, dude.", Why do we even have a buddy system? Is he in the bathroom? You need to tell me if Gavin is pooping.," No, do not laugh, okay? You're not even Caleb.", You're Gavin., You're Caleb.," If you're Caleb, where's Hunter? Hunter! Hunter! Okay, who was Hunter's buddy? Hmm? Oh, I was."," Oh, crap."," Oh, Dennis, what a mess.", You have 30 seconds to get out of this facility.," I don't know, Ron."," I mean, it's been a week.", It might not work., It'll work.," But what if it doesn't? What if we did all that research and handed Gryzzl a fully-formed plan to revitalize an entire neighborhood and build a new national park, and their board still says no? Then you'll be secure in the knowledge that you gave it your best shot.", But I do really think they will go for it.," What makes you so confident? A wise woman once told me that whenever you and I team up, good things happen."," Also, they called three hours ago, said they approved the plan, and asked me to begin drawings for the renovation.", You jerk., You sat on that news and let me stew here for three hours? Yup., You jerk! We did it! You jerk., We did it! Yep., Congratulations., I do not approve of this., Don't care.,   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 07,"We're going to have orchids on the all the pews, right?","Because orchids are Donna's favorite flowers, and she's my favorite flower.",We're real cute.,"Well, of course, there are going to be orchids.",You think this is my first time working a side job as a wedding planner for a former coworker?,No?,I'm so sorry.,"I mostly have my rage problem under control, but planning is very stressful.","Please, avoid my trigger words, flowers, schedule, vows, bride, groom, food, love, happy, church, event, wedding, and Craig.","I'm so sorry, Craig.",I'm sorry.,I'm sorry.,"April, walk with me.",So I chose you as my maid of honor because you've become one of my best friends.,And I love you like a sister.,Ew.,"But also, because you're tough.",My family arrives tonight.,I know.,And they're all set with their welcome bags.,"And I told your brother, LeVondrious, that he is not welcome.","Good, but still, there's going to be 28 Meagles in one room, which means there's gonna be drama.",I will handle everything.,I actually care whether you're having a good time and are happy.,It's weird.,The Meagles are a coldblooded crew of judgmental grudgeholders.,"My cousin Winnie once forgot to use a coaster at my grandpa's house, and he wrote her out of his will.",The last four Meagle family Pictionary tournaments ended at the hospital.,"Legally, no more than three Meagles are allowed on an international flight together.",But they give great gifts.,Got to get that flatware.,"Tommy, I was at the nail salon and I picked up some geranium hand cream.",Do you want to try it?,"Uh, yes.","Warm it up, please.",Ooh!,That smells nice.,"I'm just gonna go and make sure everything is set for tonight, okay?","All right, see you later.","See you, Ron.",I've always liked that Lucy.,Glad things are going well.,Better than well.,And guess what I have planned for tonight.,No.,"As Donna's butler of honor, I'm going all out.",Baby blue brocade.,"As a surprise, I got a matching dress for Lucy.",And you believe Lucy will be happy with this gift?,"A hundred percent, we're so in sync.",I finally feel like I'm with the person I'm going to be with forever.,I'd marry her tomorrow.,"Bully for you, son.","More importantly, do you have tritip for tonight?","Because if not, I brought my own.",I love weddings.,"Good food, the celebration of romantic love, and most of all, churches.","Say what you will about organized religion, those bastards knew how to construct an edifice.","Okay, monsters.",Mommy and Daddy have to pack because we're going to a hotel.,But Roz is going to stay here with you.,"Yeah, and we are going to have so much fun, we're going to play games, we're going to color, maybe we're going to even sit quietly for 30 seconds.",Do you think I could have 30 seconds?,Is all She's fading.,"Roz, Roz.",Hey.,Hey.,You are a wonderful nanny.,Oh.,You're tough and strong.,And you're an excellent caretaker for our children.,"Yeah, every time you come to our house, we are so happy to see you.",I love you more than Ben.,I do.,"If Ben left me, I would be sad but I would get through it.",But if you left me I would never recover.,Thanks.,That helps.,"I'm so used to packing for them, I almost put in diapers for myself.","Incoming call, Jen Barkley.",Jen Barkley is calling again.,She's relentless.,Jen is a powerful political operative.,Don't you even want to know what she has to say?,"She'll just say what she always says, which is, ""Leslie, would you consider running for state Senate or Congress?",""" And I'll say, ""Jen, thank you very much, ""that's very flattering but I love my job ""and I get to do it for the entire country.",""" The whole world is my park.","Besides, our lives are so chaotic, we can't run a campaign.","Well, if you really wanted to do it, we'd find a way.","I mean, things aren't that chaotic.",All three of them just bonked into each other and broke everything you own.,I don't know what that was.,Oh!,Would you look at that?,"Sweetie, I think your best friend, Tom, is giving his lady friend a gift.",You know Gayle gives me a gift each and every day.,"Oh, I've got the greatest gift of all.",Being married to you.,Oh!,Sweetie!,"Control yourselves, Gergiches!","Damn, Tommy, well done!",I knew you'd like it.,"Get changed, baby.",We've got to dominate this party.,"What do you think, Ron?",Tommy's the man.,I normally don't get involved in people's personal affairs but something about a wedding I'll just say it.,Tom is quite taken with you.,"He's taken with me, huh?",Yes!,"He said he'd ""marry you tomorrow.",""" Seems silly to stay at a hotel that's 10 minutes from our house.","It's been three years, we deserve one night away together.",A little down time.,A little privacy.,Maybe we make some more kids?,Don't even joke about that.,"Let's just make, like, three more so that each one of them can have a friend.",Jen?,What are you doing here?,You idiots won't answer my calls and what I have to tell you cannot wait.,What's that horrible sound?,Children.,Ugh!,Your life is gross.,My life is amazing.,"Jen, thank you so much for coming but we have to go.",I have never been late for an event that requires an RSVP.,"You guys live in Pawnee, Indiana.",Where do you have to go?,Puttin' up a new scarecrow?,"Could you, please, just get to the point?",Sure.,"Paul Hartwell, who is your congressional incumbent from this district, is a moron.",Even by Washington standards.,But he wins every year because he's a horrible bully and nobody opposes him.,Till now.,Indiana's 10th district needs a new leader.,Someone who's made it a home.,"Who cares about our citizens, and who understands the local economy.","Jen, I told you.",I have a dream job.,I don't want to A candidate named Ben Wyatt.,Sorry?,"I'm dead serious, Ben.",I think you should run for the House of Representatives.,Whoa!,What was that?,That was huge.,"Hang on, this is Congress you're talking about.",Like where Like bills become laws.,I am not qualified for that.,"We're talking about the House of Representatives, Ben.",You might be over qualified.,"Hartwell's biggest weakness is the economy, which is your exact strength.",You're young.,You're smart.,You're running the biggest city in the district.,I saw you handle that WiFi thing on TV.,"My firm is ready to go, as soon as you say the word.",Are you in or are you out?,"Uh, two of the three kids are showering in their pajamas, and most of Ben's ties are in the toilet.","Just like, as a update of where things are at.","I mean, this is chaos.","Guys, it happened a really long time ago, right?",And it was probably an accident.,"Oh, yeah, I'm sure the Dig Dug machine just unplugged itself, right before I was about to beat his high score.","Yeah, I'm sure it was an accident.","Hey, status report?",The Meagles are weird.,The words that they say sound passive but seem aggressive.,"I feel like there should be a term for that, like Nicey meany.","Yeah, I just had to physically separate two 80yearold men who were arguing about whether it was really Lena Horne in that grocery store in 1970.","Okay, you stay on the Key Largo and Denver Meagles, and I will handle the Berlin Meagles.",Done.,"So, you're thinking about Jen's offer?",Yes.,"I mean, how would this even work?","Our lives are so busy, and if I won, I would be a Congressman or woman, I mean, equal rights.","No, that doesn't apply.",Okay.,Try this.,"Tonight, just act like you've decided to run.","And then tomorrow, at the wedding, act like you've decided not to run.",See which one feels better.,Okay.,And what do you think I should do?,Ben has to run.,I don't want to push it because it might backfire but he has to run.,He would be good for America.,Good for the world.,Ben should be the Royal Archduke Sultan Emperor of all inhabitable lands on Earth.,I'm completely neutral.,I will support you no matter what you do.,"You told Lucy, I want to marry her?","Damn it, son, the small hamburgers!",Ron!,You have to walk back what you said.,"""Walk back"" sounds like lying.",Can you drop your strict life codes for a second and help me out?,"Even though I've known Lucy for years, and can see myself spending a life together with her, having children, walking the grounds of Tommy's Bahama, a private island, I'll eventually buy.","That's way in the future, man.","Don't call me, ""Man.",""" That's what you took away from this?",Uh!,Don't serve this man.,No more food until he fixes the giant disaster he's created.,Okay.,"Starting now, you're in campaign mode.","So first up, meet and greet.","You remember how this goes, right?",Your goal is to act like everyone is interesting and important.,"Hey, guys.",Nope.,Too hard.,Let's try someone else.,Okay.,Oh!,"Here's Donna's parents, okay?",Okay.,Work your magic.,You got it.,"Hi, Mr.",And Mrs.,"Meagle, I presume.",I am Mr.,Meagle but we're divorced.,I'm Grace Callahan.,"Well, I'm sorry Ms.",Callahan.,It's Doctor Callahan.,"Well, I hope that you are a podiatrist or a dentist because I seem to have a case of footinmouth disorder.","Hey, guys.",How's everything going?,"April, we couldn't be happier and you are an angel for asking.","Yeah, it's surprisingly painless.","No swiping, no passiveaggressive comments No drama at all.","Here are all the troublemakers, boss.",Thank you.,"Meagles, I am not screwing around, okay?","Lauren, no more discussion of Majorca.",Majorca is offlimits.,"Brian and Gloria, stop making Horatio feel bad that your daughter went to Yale.",No one gives a And Ginuwine.,Yes.,Get it together.,"I'm sorry, April.",Kathy started this.,"""It's Kathy that started"" I don't care!",She doesn't mean it.,"Don't cry, Ginuwine, it's okay.","Thanks, Andy.",Easypeasy.,Lemon sneezy.,"Lucy, I have something to tell you.",I am a liar.,What?,"Well, no, I am not a liar.",I have never lied about anything in my life.,"Though, I suppose you could construe camouflage as a lie.",What is happening right now?,Tom wanted to convey that he likes you a great deal.,So he said that he could imagine marrying you and living on an island with your kids.,"Wait, now we're on an island?",With kids?,Plural?,Yes.,"Now, do you know where I can find those little ham balls?","Watch out for those riding lawnmowers, man.","Babe, you are killing it.","I am, right?",Yes.,"See, just thinking I'm a Congressman makes me feel like one.",Yes.,"Oh, also, I have a little secret.",I'm drunk.,I am too.,"Ever since we had our kids, it only takes, like, one sip of wine.",I feel so good and condifent.,Con I feel condifent.,You know what you should do?,You should give a toast.,"Because if you were running for Congress, you have to give speeches, right?",You want me to make a toast?,I'll toast it up.,"Toast it, baby.",Roast it and toast it till it's brown on both sides!,"Hey everybody, I'm Ben Wyatt.","Listen, we, of course, are here to celebrate Donna and Joe.","And I have to say, you know, getting married is the bravest, most wonderful thing you can do.","Because every day you come home and you're just like ""What?","""It's you, I love you.","""You're my sexy roommate.","""We love each other.",""" Whoo!",He's talkin' about me.,"Yes, I am, babydoll.","Look, Donna and Joe are great.",You all are great.,And this wedding is gonna to be amazing.,Let's get some music and dancing going.,"And I am Ben Wyatt, and I very much approve this message!",You want me to shut that down?,"No, I like it.",Let the little man dance.,Hey!,My head Last night was so fun but my head Died.,Yeah.,"Yeah, mine's filled with concrete.","Okay, so Yesterday, you pretended you were going to run.","Today, you're going to pretend like you're not going to run.","Oh, no.","Jen posted the campaign add, it's everywhere.",I'm running.,"How could she do this to Oh, God, I'm remembering things.","We called Jen last night, didn't we?","Yeah, we did.",Oh!,"I also called Oh, God.",Bad.,What do we do?,There you are.,Surprise.,Surprise.,Whoa!,You guys should have corner boothed it because you look awful.,You're gonna scare off the other customers.,"Hey, Jen.",All those kids keep you up all night?,So happy with my choices.,"Okay, Jen.",Yeah.,I know I left you a message last night but I really do think you should have checked with me before throwing me into this.,No.,Ben.,"I'm sorry, you left me four messages last night.",What?,And they contain very specific policy positions.,"I want to come out strong on education, then I'll tack hard into fiscal responsibility.","Oh, God.",8675309 I love that song.,"Jenny, I got your number Hey, babe, it's ringing!","Honey, you were a lot more lucid than I was.",Wait.,Were you guys drunk?,That is hilarious.,"No, we weren't Oh, you guys are going to fit in so great in Washington.",Most of Congress is drunk all of the time.,"Okay, official presser is tomorrow at 9:00.","You could bail if you want, but it would be embarrassing.",Might derail your career.,Might not.,Probably will.,"Well, you never do know, though, right?","So, just let me know what you want to do.",Okay?,Well I'm just going to spend my time doing exactly what I want to do.,Because I don't have children.,"Bye, guys.","Ron, I'm Walden with the Church's historical archives.",You called about wanting information on the building?,"I did, indeed.",Let's start with the faade.,Was the limestone locally handhewn?,No.,"In the late 1870s, it was actually cheaper to import limestone from Michigan.",Fascinating.,But tell me I'll do whatever you want.,I'm fine with whatever.,No.,Wherever you want.,No pressure.,Excuse me.,"Oh, my God!",Oh!,Look at how beautiful you look.,"Leslie, I'm not even in my dress yet.",But you're going to be very soon.,"All right, I want to say something to my girls.","Knope, you're a softie but on the inside you're a straightup boss.","April, you're the exact opposite.",You all inspire me and I love you.,"And you too, Michelle.","Michelle, you were my best friend from childhood.",Until we lost touch because you thought your college boyfriend was into me.,He was.,I never gave him the time of day.,"But now, we're rebuilding our friendship.",Is this wedding going to be a test for you?,Yes.,"But the doctors once told you, you were never going to walk again, so This should be easy, right?",Wow.,What a complicated tapestry that is.,"Bring it in, bring it in.",Moment over.,"Leslie, April, help Donna with her dress.","Hi, I'm Typhoon.","Typhoon, I am interested, but now is not the time.","Michelle, get the bouquet.",You're skating on very thin ice.,I couldn't help but notice from afar that you are both acting like weirdoes.,I further suspect you have not yet talked about what happened.,What?,"I don't even know what you're talking about, us having not talked about.",I only meant to say that there's no shame in declaring how you feel to a person you cherish.,I am sorry if I caused a problem because the two of you make a good team.,"If you'll excuse me, I missed out on the food, and was denied a fascinating conversation about Michigan limestone.",But I'll be damned if I don't properly honor the expression of romantic love.,Ron does this weird thing where he says exactly what he means.,You just have to ignore him.,So you didn't mean what you said?," Look, I'm all in.", That's all I meant.," I didn't want you to think I was crazy or jumping the gun, and I know you just got out of a relationship so I don't expect you to feel the same way, but That's how I feel."," Well, I'm only dating you for the free dresses, so I'm fine with that.", Donna.," Even though I've known you for years, I feel like I learn something new about you every day."," Just yesterday I learned that the Pearl Jam album, Vitalogy was written about you."," You are an amazing, confident woman.", And I love you., I know that I can be a lot., And awhile back I was thinking I'd never find someone who loved me for me.," But you're patient and kind and together, we can do anything.", You may now kiss the bride.," Hey, Roz."," Okay, we have the zebras."," Tell the kids not to worry, they're coming back home."," Also, we want to give you a raise.", And anything you want to take from our house., Okay., Bye., How in the world am I supposed to run for office? Our lives are like one big unexpected stuffed zebra emergency.," I don't know, what do you think I should do? I told you, I'm neutral."," Honey, you have never been neutral on anything in your life.", You have an opinion on pockets.," Yes, I think they should all be bigger."," Okay, fine.", I think you should run.," Yes, our lives are bonkers but if something is worth it, and I think this is, then you just make it work."," Besides, I just read an article on two minute micro-naps and the science on them is very promising.", Ben Wyatt.," Any comment on the report that you're running for Congress? I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now.", Your only experience in politics was as a failed mayor at age 18.," Okay, please, everyone.", We're at a wedding., And I'm holding zebras.," I mean what qualifies you to take over Hartwell's seat? Guys, listen to me, please."," I'm dealing with an actual problem right now, okay? Which, by the way, is what I do for a living.", I solve problems.," As a budget specialist, and for five years as a City Manager and I'm pretty good at it."," I have worked hard to transform this area into a fiscally sound destination for people who want good jobs and a good public education, and I think the results speak for themselves.", My name is Ben Wyatt and I'm running for Congress.," My God, babe, that was so hot.", Donna., Hey., How did I do? Everything was perfect., You are a miracle worker.," But I gotta say, I kind of miss the Meagle drama.", I thought for sure somebody was going to do something crazy., But everybody is just nice and chill.," Anyway, I love you, and to thank you, I'm going to try not to hug you.", Thank you., I'm going to hug you.," No! Okay, all right."," Wyatt, why didn't you tell us you were running for Congress? Well, we didn't want to steal your thunder.", Steal my thunder? I'm sorry.," Have you seen how I'm wearing this dress? Okay, well, in that case, yes, I am.", To Ben., To Donna and Joe., To me., I own my own restaurant and several other properties., It's always worth celebrating.," Who's Gary? Oh, I think that's supposed to be me."," That's your new name, Garry.", Garry., Garry! Garry! Garry! Garry! Garry! Garry is my real name.," Yes, after 30 years, my co-workers are finally going to call me by my real name."," Oh, boy, I'm blessed."," Everyone, can I have your attention, please? Now, it's time for a surprise musical guest."," One of my all-time favorites, me.", I had a girl Donna was her name Donna.," Joe! I hope you saved a slice of that cake for your estranged brother, LeVondrious."," What's up, girl? Didn't expect to see your baby bro at your wedding, huh? Well, I'm here.", Despite what you did to me all those years ago., What I did? This is because of what you did.," Oh, you must be referring to the microwave incident.", Yeah., Don't worry., I brought it back., Now no one gets any popcorn., You said you wanted a little drama.," That's why I love you, girl.",   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 08,Okay.,"So, the central question that these senators are going to be asking is why should we invest in the National Park Service?",April.,"Well, it is simple, Leslie.","In today's fastpaced society, National Parks are still the best place for fullmoon werewolf transformations.","I know you're kidding, but I also know that you're prepared, and we are going to do great.",How psyched are you about this trip?,"April, are you superpsyched?",Yeah.,"Also, you have lipstick on your teeth.",I do?,Okay.,Good looking out.,We're a great team.,"Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I think I know what's going on in your head.",Oh!,"Well, then, welcome to the Terrordome.",Okay.,You need to tell Leslie that you want to leave your job.,No.,She freaks out when anything changes.,"One time, Andy told her that I was getting rid of my bangs and she called 911.",Okay.,"Well, I can't keep your secret much longer.","Any time your name comes up, I panic and change the subject to the Twin Peaks reboot until she gets bored.","So, you talk for one second?",You're going to spend the next couple of days with her.,"If you talk to her directly and honestly, she can be surprisingly openminded.","Oh, really?","Oh, okay.",Yeah.,Leslie?,"Um, I was thinking about What do you think?",What?,Why?,On what grounds?,It's readable and compact.,It's all on one page.,That's insane.,Don't mess with that.,"I appreciate your initiative, but itineraries are not the right place to mess around.",Yeah.,"April, I told you that was an absurd idea.",I don't care what Ben says.,I'm not going to tell Leslie I'm leaving my job on this trip.,She'll drown me in the Potomac while she recites facts about the Potomac.,"Well, don't fret, cookie.","We've made progress, haven't we?",We've got a whole list of all the things you need out of a new job.,"Apple juice, barbecue sauce, Count Chocula Wait.","Oh, sorry.",That's the list of cool new nicknames I want people to call me.,Here's your list.,How can I tell her I'm leaving when I don't even know what job I want?,Babe.,I wish you were coming with me.,I just decided what I'm going to do while April is out of town.,I'm going to round up the team and find her a new job.,Yeah.,"Ben Wyatt, please?",Tell him it's Count Chocula.,"No, it's Andrew Dwyer.",I'm sorry.,"So, April wants to leave.",I always knew she would tire of government.,Took long enough.,"Well, both me and Ben are trying to help April find a new job, and we thought maybe she could work for you.","I feel like it would be a perfect fit, although I don't know exactly what you guys do here.",I'm guessing it's a business?,Assassins?,Hit men?,Doctors.,You guys are doctors?,We build things.,"Come on, let me show you around.",This is a door.,"These, of course, are walls.",What else?,What else?,Ah.,"Meet our vice president, Don Swanson.","Don, this is Andrew and Benjamin.",Pleasure to meet you.,Is this your brother?,You have a brother?,No.,Fine.,"Yes, suppose the cat's out of the bag.",I have a brother.,One brother.,"All those years together at the Parks Department, and you never told us you had a brother.",You worked at the Parks Department?,Tour is over.,Okay.,"Carryon bags packed, trashy magazines purchased, boarding passes in hand, and we have 26 minutes for unstructured chat time.",What do you want to talk about?,I don't know.,Nothing.,I thought maybe we could talk about your future.,You want to talk about your future?,Yeah.,I've actually been thinking about that a lot lately.,"Yeah, I figured.",It's hard at your age to figure out your path.,I know.,Yeah.,"I was going to surprise you with this in Washington, but what the heck.",It's unstructured chat time.,So Tada!,"This is your clear, definitive path through the federal government.",It starts here today with this flight and it goes all the way to 2022.,"Cool, right?",Wow!,This is intense.,"I had to make some guesses about your ultimate government objectives and your fashion choices, etcetera.","But the point is, with this, you don't have to worry.",I know.,I feel so relaxed.,"Yeah, I know.",What's up with these shirts?,"Just a little fun I was having, you know?",I didn't really make the shirts.,"But did you, though?","Yes, I did.",Tada!,"Oh, and also, I have a middle seat.",April!,Group One is boarding.,Break it down.,What will she be doing at this job?,"Well, she'd have about six people reporting to her.","If she started soon, she could project manage our new warehouse in Snerling.","""Get to be my own boss.",""" So far, so good.","She also wants ""passionate interest in subject matter.",""" So, what kind of building is it?",It's a largescale storage unit for surplus vinyl sheeting.,"Okay, so, that's boring.","Would she have an opportunity to practice any ""creative problem solving""?",Creativity is for people with glasses who like to lie.,"Although I suppose she could use ""creative"" ways to organize and stack the vinyl sheeting.","No, that's insane.",We use the Towson Method.,It's tried and true.,I think this might be a dead end.,I think you might be right.,But getting a good person out of government is a worthwhile endeavor.,I will help.,"But first, I'm going to need some grub.",Ooh!,Yeah.,Let's grab some lunch and some ice cream and then maybe some aftericecream tacos.,We'll just brainstorm.,Maybe grab some snacks.,Vaughn.,Lon.,Ron.,Ron.,"Okay, I think we're all set.","Even though I'm taking the lead on these meetings, don't be afraid to jump in.",Copy that.,"April, when Randy brings up the river project, that is your cue to Distract the guard so the Hamburglar can make his escape.",We're meeting with a lot of senators today.,Is she going to be okay?,Yeah.,It's just April.,Trust me.,And we hope you agree that this is the best plan to preserve National Parks' funding into the next decade.,"Well, so, Leslie, what do you think?",Is this the right move?,"Well, I think it's the only move, Senator Boxer.",I don't think this chance is going to come around again.,"Well, you know, if it's good with Leslie, it's good with me.","Well, I have another great idea.","How about you and me, April, Randy, ""Historical Lampposts of D.",C.,""" walking tour?",Starts in 15 minutes.,"Sounds great, but I do have an appointment with the President.",Can we come?,What kind of a business is this?,"Is it, like, hit man or astronauts?",It's an accounting firm.,But they recently opened up a consulting wing.,And consulting is perfect for April.,You think this Barney fellow will listen to what we have to say?,Ben!,Ben is here.,"Hi, Ben.",Ted!,Ben is here!,Hey.,"It is ""actuarily"" very good to see you guys.",Ben!,They like me here.,You've got to hear this.,"So, we think we can keep costs down and still meet deadlines.",I have to say I'm really impressed with what you guys are doing over at Interior.,"Thank you, Senator Gillibrand.",We really appreciate your support.,Would you mind signing a copy of your book?,Of course.,Of course.,I took the liberty of writing the inscription.,All you have to do is sign.,"""To Leslie, my inspiration, my muse, ""my partner in crime.",I owe it all to you.,""" And there's room for a P.",S.,If you feel there's more you left out.,"Well, I think I've said all I want to say right here.",Okay.,Okay.,"Yeah, but I can't do that right now.","Oh, boy.",I'll call you back.,"Hello, Senator.",Do you have a minute to chat?,"Well, I can't right now.",I've got a meeting.,"Well, you Actually, I checked with your staff, and they said that you have a free halfhour.",Did anyone ever tell you that your tenacity can be intimidating?,Yes.,Every month of my life since fourth grade.,"Now, let's talk about National Parks.","Well, I just have to say I'm very surprised that the two of you are seeing eye to eye on this one.","Well, Senator Booker and I are both concerned about our nation's resources, and that absolutely includes our National Parks.",But that's not all we have in common.,"In fact, our real passion is Polynesian folk music.",Polynesian folk music.,What?,Polynesian folk music.,Our band is playing in Georgetown tonight if you'd like to come.,"We're called ""Across the Isle.",""" Did you get that?","""Isle""?","""Isle"" like an island and then ""across the aisle""?","The political ""aisle""?","It's, like, a pun.",It's a play on words.,I do get it.,We are definitely coming to this.,It's $8 if you buy your tickets now.,It's $10 at the door.,A fiscal conservative.,Love this guy.,Love this guy.,Yeah.,April LudgateDwyer.,She worked on the Gryzzl deal that you guys did the finances for.,"Now, I know that you're opening up a consulting wing, and I just think that April would be a great hire.","Yeah, and here's the thing, Barney.",We're obviously very familiar with what consulting is.,But why don't you go ahead and tell my friends here.,Because I don't think that they know.,"Well, it's really about finding creative solutions to difficult problems.","Now, a lot of times, there's firing.","So, consultants aren't exactly wellliked.",Holy crap.,"This is the job for her, I can feel it.",She'll take it.,"Now, let's talk perks.",Does she get the summer off?,Is it like school?,Son.,Easy.,"Well, what did she major in?",Economics?,Accounting?,"She designed her own major, Halloween Studies.","Trust me, Barney.",She's brilliant and a very fast learner.,Does that compound your interest?,Huh?,What do you say?,"Huh, Barney?","Ben, that was amazing.",Thank you.,But it's too late for her to apply.,"I'm sorry, but we're not really taking any more applicants.",Though I could make an exception for someone else.,Not interested.,Okay.,"So, five yeses and four noes.",Not a bad start.,"So, Leslie, I was going to talk to you about this in a few weeks, but Mike Norbert is retiring.","Oh, really?",Old Norbs is stepping down.,"Couldn't handle the pressure, huh?",What a wuss.,His marriage is falling apart.,Oh!,"Oh, okay.",She had an affair with his best friend.,Okay.,I feel bad about what I said before.,Yeah.,I get it.,I get it.,"So, anyway.","Good news for you is, we'd like to promote you to Deputy Director of Operations at Interior.",Wow.,You'd have to move to D.,C.,", and you'd have to complete the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program.",I have to enroll in SESCDP?,Fortyfour weeks of intensive courses and notetaking?,"Um, it's a dream come true.","And I have to warn you, there will be a confirmation hearing.",A confirmation hearing?,A freaking confirmation hearing?,Excuse me a second.,What's that?,Mmmhmm.,Mmmhmm.,"To the best of my recollection, yes, I accept the job.",Oh!,"Excuse me, ma'am.",Do you mind if I borrow your hat?,I just want to throw it up in the air victoriously.,No.,Ma'am?,I think that job is perfect for April.,We just have to convince Barney to give her a shot.,"First problem, she's not as qualified as the other applicants.",Simple solution?,I break into her college and I change her degree to accounting.,Easy.,"On my way out, look up at the blackboard.",What is that?,Impossible math equation?,I solve it.,"X equals Y, obviously.","Professor comes up to me, he says, ""I've been working on that for 50 years.","""Why don't you accept this math trophy?",""" By the time he turns around, I'm gone.",We need to highlight April's strengths.,I thought we could update her rsum.,This is the one she applied to Parks with.,It's just a signed photograph of a puppet named ALF.,"Okay, so we make her an actual rsum, then put on a big presentation, show Barney that she's more than qualified.",We're going to need all hands on deck.,"That's Craig, Donna, and most importantly Please, no.",Come on.,Don't do it.,Oh.,You want to photocopy?,You guys want to do all the mindless work?,"Yeah, I didn't think so.",Get me Garry Gergich.,"Look around, April.",What do you see?,Fountains.,Water.,Sky.,You.,Looking at me like a crazy person.,I see a new home.,"I am going to take that job, Ben's going to run for Congress, he will win eventually, and then we're going to split our time between Washington and Pawnee.",That's great.,It looks like everything is falling into place for you.,"For us, April.",For us.,"Oh, God.",Whoa!,What is that over there?,A lamppost?,"Is that historic, do you think?","No, they put that in in the '70s.","Look, I am so ahead of my fiveyear plan.",Which means that you're going to need a new fiveyear plan.,And here it is.,"Ow, it's hot.",How did you make this so fast?,I keep a local bindermaker on retainer in D.,C.,We are about to embark on such an amazing journey.,"This is going to be our city, and this is going to be our bench.","April, we have a bench in D.",C.,"I'm sorry, Leslie.",I can't do this anymore.,I don't want to work in government.,I quit.,What are you talking about?,You quit?,Why?,"Because honestly, I don't even know if I like working in National Parks.",Or government.,"I just fell backwards into your world, and years have gone by.","And now, I'm here.",And Andy and Ben have been helping me look into different jobs to figure out what I really want to do.,Ben who?,Ben Wyatt?,He's been helping you behind my back?,Wow.,Okay.,"Well, you know what?",We had a good run.,But he's dead to me now.,"It's just, I've been on this weird path my entire adult life, and I need to figure out what I really want.",I cannot believe you're quitting.,And I cannot believe this is the first time I'm hearing it.,"And on our bench, of all places.",It's just so frustrating.,"I love her, but you spend so much time and effort on someone's life and she's just going to quit on me?","It's like, what's the point, you know?","Wow, Leslie.",I haven't seen you this upset since you almost forgot Ann's halfbirthday.,Yeah.,Tell me.,How many times have we had lunch?,Five.,"Well, eight if you count all those times I showed up unannounced at your office with minimuffins.",And why have we had lunch so many times?,"Well, because when I knew I would be coming to Washington to work, I wore you down until you agreed to become my friend.","I'm so glad that you did, and you are a wonderful friend.","But sometimes, you're so focused and driven that you forget about people's feelings.",Name one time I've done that.,"Well, you were so wrapped up in your story that you actually ate my waffle.","Sometimes, all you can do is give people a little bit of advice and a push.",But you have to realize April has to be able to make up her own mind.,"You're right, once again, Madeleine Albright.",Can I have my pin back now?,Oh!,"Oh, yeah, sorry.",Thank you for letting me wear it.,It just makes me feel very powerful.,"Me, too.",Rsum's done.,"I used bullet points instead of numbers, because I find it conveys strength and competence.",A binder of her accomplishments.,Photos of her getting the job done.,"And $500 cash, in case you want to go the straightup bribe route.",Donna.,"You put me on the team, I find a way to win.",Okay.,Copies are made.,"Everything has been collated and stapled, and all the research has been doublechecked.",I went through quite a few staples.,I added a personal testimony vouching for April's brilliance.,"And this guy better appreciate it, because I do not compare people to Mary J.",Blige lightly.,"Uh, no one should.",Do you want to go to dinner tonight?,I do not.,Respect.,I'm free.,I have plans.,"Well, great job, guys.","With all this, Barney will at least have to give her a shot.","Sure, they did a good job, but this isn't enough.",I've been thinking about it all day.,And I have a plan to go the extra mile and make April seem like the ideal candidate.,Give me the job!,"My name's April Ludgate, and my talent is explosive.",Go USA!,USA!,USA!,USA!, USA!, When should I tell April to show up?, My car., Hey., Thank you for coming.," Yeah, well, I had to miss the ""Memorable Rain Gutters of Washington"" walking tour, so this better be good.", I'm sorry I blew up at you yesterday.," I really want all of my friends to be happy together, but more importantly, I just want them to be happy."," If you feel like you need to move on, I totally get it."," Okay, turn around.", What? Why? Because I'm about to say something serious and I can't do it if I have to look you in the eye., Please., Okay.," Now, take your shoes off and wear them like mittens.", April.," Okay, sorry."," When I started working for you, I was aimless and just thought everything was stupid and lame.", And you turned me into someone with goals and ambition., Which is really the only reason why I'm even thinking about what I really want., And I just want to say thank you., And I love you very much., Which is why I have decided not to turn you into a sea urchin., Which I could do because I am an actual witch with powers and I'm evil I know., And I hate everything., I know you do., I know.," Thank you, April."," So, you don't have any idea what you want to do? Well, here's the good news.", I am on the case., I know some people who might be able to help us., Come on.," April, this is Alyssa, from the American Service Foundation."," They take young people like you who are trying to explore a new path, and match them with one of the thousands ofjobs across America that help communities."," Alyssa, this is April Ludgate, the single greatest human being ever, and you need to find her a job that she will love and cherish and make her life feel complete."," Okay, I'm sorry.", I found this crazy woman on the street and she won't leave me alone.," Oh, I'm very familiar with Leslie's enthusiasm.", They contacted us last year because they wanted to place some people in National Parks.," Two days later, we had set up the entire program, and she sent me a throw pillow with my face stitched onto it.", Not my best work.," Plus, you changed your hair.", I'm going to send you another one., Okay., Go solve all of your career problems., I'll wait right here., Sorry., That a girl., Ugh! Mom.," I don't know, Madeleine."," They're taking forever, and I'm starting to lose it."," Talk to me, okay? Your voice makes me calm.", Tell me another Yeltsin story.," Okay, she's here.", I have to go., Bye., Say hi to your daughters., Hey., Hi., How did it go? I'm great., I know exactly what I want to do., Yes., Is it Teach for America? No., Habitat for Humanity? No., It's working with animals., No., I want to work here., At the Foundation., I want to be like Alyssa.," I want to tell people what to do, and then send them far away from me.", It's perfect., And it hits everything on my list.," Creative problem solving, working one-on-one I am 100,000% in support of this idea.", This is an amazing idea., I love this idea., And I love you.," So, are they hiring? What did Alyssa say when you told her? Nothing.", I didn't tell her yet., I wanted to see if you thought it was a good idea first., What? Bad idea? You wanted to run something by me? My God., Yes.," So, will you help me? April, you don't need me.", You can get any job you want all by yourself.," Obviously, I'm going to vet your resume and we'll hold some mock-interviews and I'll choose your outfit and everything.", But you can get this sucker on your own.," So, long story short, we might have found you the perfect job."," But also, I might have blown it.", Ben and Ron are there now to try to fix it.," And if they don't, I feel like it's kind of on them.", Everyone is being so nice to me lately., It's weird., I feel like I need to take a shower in pig's blood to wash all the niceness off me., It's because we love you., We want you to be happy., This consulting job could be the answer., Yeah.," So, about that Please don't hold anything Andy did against April."," She is an exceptional human being, who married a well-meaning goofball."," Yeah, and I think that presentation we put together says it all."," All we're asking is that you meet with her, and seriously consider her for the job."," And if she disappoints you, you can hold me accountable Right? You know what? If her friends are trying this hard, there must be something amazing about her.", Tell her I'll meet with her tomorrow Hold on., April? Hey., We were just talking about you., We've got some good news.," Oh, boy.", Okay., She doesn't want the job., I see.," Well, this is uncomfortable.",   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 09,We need to go over the schedule leading up to the primary.,Let's talk shop.,"Ooh, shop talk.","One of my five favorite types of talk, along with pillow, girl, real, and TED.",Why are you wearing a poncho?,"Oh, because every surface area in your house is sticky.","Last time I was here, I found a melted crayon on my blazer.",Okay.,I have a photo op with Gryzzl tomorrow.,Between now and then we have a ton of stuff scheduled.,Looks like we're gonna have to skip the pie baking event and the ceremonial squash toss.,"Oh, really?",We have to skip that?,I love watching those squashes fly through the air.,I kind of like the way they land.,"Me, too.","Okay, excuse me, but I have to get back to a city, where things happen.",Okay.,This campaign is about to start in earnest.,Things are about to get real intense.,"Leslie, you ready?","Me, Leslie?",Yeah.,"Well, I was an actual candidate, so I think I can handle being a candidate's wife.",I know all the issues inside and out.,"Mmm, see, that's the problem.",Being the wifeof is a minefield.,"If you were just a dingdong, I would just slap a flag pin on you, and pour some Valium down your throat, and just shove you behind the podium way upstage.",It's the smarties that freak people out.,I think you're underestimating the voters.,I don't think that is possible.,"Stephen, be careful.",Poncho!,"I know you normally hate foundations, but this one I think you'll actually like.",We take people that don't know what they wanna do and then put them to work doing cool stuff all over the world.,And I start in a couple months.,"Well, I had hoped you'd choose a more dignified trade like masonry or logging.","But you are out of local government, and that's a step in the right direction.",It's definitely the job I wanted.,But it means that we have to move to Washington.,Well.,Then bully for you.,"If you intend to move, I suppose you should return the spare key to my house.","The one I gave you years ago when you were my assistant, for emergencies.",Okay.,Good talk.,This neighborhood has been mostly abandoned for years.,"But now, thanks to the new Gryzzl headquarters, this district will soon transform into a hub of innovation for decades to come.",Mister Wyatt.,Your campaign released a schedule.,And it looks like your wife is skipping the Pie Mary.,Care to explain?,"The Pie Mary is a Southern Indiana tradition, where Congressional candidates' wives face off in a piebaking contest.",The last contest's winner was June Hartwell's buttermilk meringue.,Last contest's loser was all women.,Leslie would be the first candidate's wife not to enter the Pie Mary.,What kind of a statement are you making by skipping it?,We're I'm not making any kind of statement.,"We're just focusing on bigger issues, like Ben's $150 million revitalization project.",Pardon me.,I need to get through.,Pardon me.,Excuse me.,Mike Patterson here.,"Leslie, you made it pretty clear that you don't think homemaking is important.",Do you ever cook for your children?,And who's even watching your children right now while you're out God only knows where?,What are you talking about?,I'm standing right here in front of you.,"Okay, take it easy.",Let's not get emotional.,"Okay, we have to run.",We'll see you all at my economic address.,"Thanks for coming, everybody.","What other traditions are you against, Leslie?",Baseball?,Hugging your children?,How much did that haircut cost?,None of your business.,And thank you for noticing.,My desk was right here.,Sitting right on top of it this whole time.,How much money is it?,It's not money.,I told you.,It's Ron's key.,I hid it in here years ago.,Hey!,Yeah.,No.,No key.,Just a note and a movie ticket stub and four teeth.,"""If you are looking for Ron's key, I moved it, ""and you'll never find it.","Cordially, April.",""" Where'd you put it then?",I don't know.,It was eight years ago.,"Oh, God.",A key to Ron's house is lost in a government building.,It's his worst nightmare.,"Listen, babe.",All we gotta do is train Champion to sniff out Ron's key.,Okay.,All we need is Ron's key to give him a scent.,So give me the key and I'll get you that key.,Welcome back to the program.,"My guest is June Hartwell, wife of incumbent Congressman Paul Hartwell.","Now, June, we all know what Ben Wyatt's wife is really saying.","By skipping the Pie Mary, she's saying, ""Women who love their families are stupid.",""" Mike, we all make certain choices.",Ms.,Knope chose to try to have it all.,I chose to put my family first.,"Oh, I'm just speculating here, but do you think that Leslie Knope's actions indicate that she actually hates her family?","Well, it only took three hours for Jen to be right.",I'm officially a distraction.,I'm gonna enter that Pie Mary.,"This is just nonsense, it'll blow over.",And the Pie Mary is ridiculous and antiquated.,"But the more they talk about this, the less they're gonna talk about your economic plan.","Besides, I'm good at making pies, so I'll win and then I can promote my selfpublished women's rights barbecue cookbook The Feminine Mesquite.",Everything's fine.,"I had it in a safe place, and then I moved it to protect it, and I don't remember where.",I see.,"Don't be mad, Ron.","She hid it too good, and she left a string of clues.",It's an impossible puzzle.,And I love puzzles.,"A minimal, unhelpful note These appear to be human teeth.",And what is this?,New Moon?,"It's a movie, but I've never seen it.","It's, like, about lame werewolves and vampires and stuff.",Donna likes those things.,Dollars to donuts this points us her way.,"Finally, a scavenger hunt worthy of my time.",Onward!,"Okay, snacks given, kids tucked in, books read, three simultaneous meltdowns for no reason, kids tucked back in, one of them briefly got outside somehow, kids back in bed, they're all napping.",Good.,I got everything you need for pie domination.,"I even got an extra whipped cream can, one for baking, one for directly into mouth.",You know me so well.,That might be one of the kids.,"Hi, Leslie.","Elise Yarktin, from the Indiana Organization of Women.","Oh, my goodness, Elise.","Please, come in.",Wait.,Are you here to give me the Woman of the Year award?,I have a speech prepared.,Would you like to see it?,Right now?,No.,"Leslie, we were thrilled to find out you were boycotting that ridiculous Pie Mary.",But we just got word you've decided to enter?,"Yeah, well, I agree that it's dumb.","But this is not about me, it's about Ben, and he will do more for women than Hartwell.","So, you know, lose a battle, win the war.",That kind of thing.,It's the way to go.,Look.,"The Pie Mary is retrogressive and misogynistic, and if you participate, we will have no choice but to protest you and Ben at the event.",Hope you like pies In your face.,Metaphorically.,We'll be civil.,Elise.,There is no bigger defender of gender equality than Leslie Knope.,"And my husband, Ben, is a progressive champion of women's rights.","Babe, the oven's ready.","Chopchop, time to get bakin'.",Daddy want pie.,"Hi, Ben Wyatt.",We have a wonderfully small number of clues.,One is this ticket.,Did you see this movie about vampires and such?,New Moon?,"Yeah, I saw it with April.","She was so hopped up on painkillers from getting her wisdom teeth out, I convinced her to see it with me.",The teeth.,They're yours.,You were super out of it.,"You kept yelling ""Team Voldemort!",""" At the screen and we were kicked out.",I was furious.,You only get to see the second Twilight  film for the seventh time once.,Do you remember anything about a key?,Or April doing anything unusual that day?,She did make us stop by the shoeshine stand before we left because she wanted to drop something off for Andy.,She had a real bad crush on him.,Oh!,Babe.,You had a crush on me.,That's embarrassing.,We're married.,Still.,To the shoeshine stand!,Ooh!,Chase me.,Stop.,Garry?,What the hell are you doing?,"Oh, gosh.","Well, I dropped my wedding ring down this grate, and then I was trying to get it out and I dropped my keys down there too, So I can't leave.","Damn, this takes me back.",Mind if I stay and watch?,Not at all.,I appreciate the company.,The IOW does not mess around.,"Which normally is why I love them, but now I'm on the other side.","Oh, my God, Ben, I gave them $100 in their annual pledge.",Do you know how many antime signs that could buy?,"You just don't do the pie contest, obviously.",Then we're just back where we started.,Then it just seems like I'm saying I'm better than the women who bake.,What should we do?,Should we get a divorce?,"Well, how about this?",What if I register for the contest?,I bake the pie.,I act as my own wife.,"Oh, that could work.","We sidestep the controversy, we refocus the campaign onto the actual candidate.",And then we flip the antiquated tradition right on its head.,Exactly.,"But more importantly, we change the idea of what a pie is.","I feel like that's not more important, but I like the energy that we have, so let's hear it.","Okay, picture this Crust on the bottom.",Filling.,Crust on top.,What am I describing?,A pie.,No.,"But you're in the right ""zone.",""" Oh.",Calzone!,Sure!,"Pies are just sweet calzones, honey.",And I'm good at making calzones.,You're amazing.,I can win this thing.,"Of course you can, baby.",Get in there and start baking.,I'm having some serious dj vu.,How many times have you lost your wedding ring?,Too many times to count.,And it causes real trouble with Gayle.,"And any time I lose my ring, she turns into a real grumpy goose.",Is that so?,"Oh, yeah.","She'll say, you know, ""Garry, you'd lose your head ""if it wasn't screwed on tight.",""" And then she makes me go for the fresh oranges for the morning OJ.","And she says, ""Hey, Mr.",Forgetful.,""" I mean, those words They rattle around here for hours.","That's why I've gotta be extra careful with this replacement ring, because if I lost I'm gonna order us some dinner.",The shoeshine stand is gone.,Or maybe it was never here.,They must have moved it during the remodel.,It's probably in basement storage.,To the basement!,Tighter.,"You sure, dude?","Yeah, dude.",Tighter.,I can do it.,"Do what, exactly?",Nothing.,We're not doing anything.,And we definitely do not live down here now.,"Guys, where's the old shoeshine stand from upstairs?",We don't know anything about that.,"Boys, think.",We are on a quest and we are not leaving until we get an answer.,"Well, we're on our own quest, which is to squeeze this just tight enough to make my eyes bulge out a little bit, but not so tight that I die.",I've been there.,That's a real tightrope walk.,Oh!,Hey!,Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.,"It had black hair, but you could see through his skin.","It didn't like me, but that's just 'cause I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.","Yeah, it said something about how it was worried Brett was gonna mug it.",Okay.,So we're looking for a racist ghost with black hair who likes shoeshines.,I think I have the answer.,The chase continues!,"Okay, wait.","At the time that you told us you were mugged in the park, what were you reaching for in the river?",A burrito.,That's right.,You fell in the river reaching for a burrito.,"Yes, ma'am.",That was not one of my finer moments.,Ooh.,It's getting late.,We need to bounce.,I can give you a ride.,"Oh, thank you, Donna.",Probably gonna get an earful when I get home tonight.,Gayle might even call me the Bword.,"""Bozo.",""" Wow.",We are very different people.,Did you hear back from Elise?,"Oh, yeah.",We're good.,The IOW is not gonna protest us.,How's your pie?,I don't know.,I didn't make a pie.,Okay.,How is your dessert calzone?,It's ready.,"The question is, are they?","All right, our next contestant Is candidate Ben Wyatt's wife, Leslie.",Let's see what Mrs.,"Wyatt has baked up for us, shall we?",It's actually Ms.,Knope.,"And actually, right now it's Mr.",Wyatt.,"Leslie has her own busy life and I happen to be an excellent pie maker, so we figured we'd switch it up a bit.","Now, pack your suitcases, because we're going to a little town Called Napoli In Italy.",Free Ben Wyatt!,Free Ben Wyatt!,Free Ben Wyatt!,"Excuse me, free me from what?",From the tyranny of women.,We are the Male Men.,"We are a men's rights activist group, and we are fed up.",I'm sorry.,What's happening now?,Behind every successful woman is a man she has oppressed.,First Leslie Knope poaches her husband's campaign by making it all about her.,Now she's forcing him to bake pies and enter a contest for her?,Excuse me!,I'm not forcing him to do anything!,He loves to cook.,Yeah.,He has five personalized aprons.,Oh.,So I guess he was asking for it because of the way he was dressed?,We are sick and tired of this feminized society.,"Men have had a very rough go of it, for Just recently.",And it ends now.,Male and proud!,Male and proud!,Male and proud!,Leslie Knope exemplifies the feminist attack on our values.,"She could learn a little something about traditional family structure from me and my husband, Marshall.",Um.,Fierce alert.,"Eat 'em up, honey.",The idea that feminism is an attack on family values is absurd.,Ooh.,So you're defending Leslie Knope?,No.,Absolutely not.,"Frankly, I don't think she's done enough to distance herself from this misogynistic lunacy.",Let's turn now to Sasha Dunkirk.,She is head of the group Women Against Feminism.,What a surprise.,The woman is only talking to other women.,Can we have one conversation about feminism where men get to be in charge?,I actually agree with him.,I don't need your pity.,"Joan, Leslie Knope and I are united Oh.",In our disgust of this week's events.,"Leslie, if you're watching, I, Brandi Maxxxx, star of 69 Jump Street and Fifty Shaved Old Gays, have your back.",Oof.,"You really stepped in it this time, Knope.",Why isn't the other candidate's wife being scrutinized like this?,Because June Hartwell is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.,"She started an awareness campaign called ""Bring a Sweater.",""" She calls it ""goose bump prevention.",""" Come on, you guys, you know the drill.","Just ignore the fact that you're right, put on your blandest outfit So that one, hopefully, and then just go out there and publicly apologize.",Done.,What?,Apologize for what?,Doesn't matter.,Just say you're sorry.,It's like taking a shot of tequila.,"You just gotta force it down, suddenly the world feels so much more pleasant.",I do three shots every time I have to enter this house.,Donna.,What are you doing here so early?,I come bearing gifts.,"First off, I got a dude in maintenance to open up that grate this morning.","So here's your rings, keys, credit cards, and I found some heart medicine I assume is yours?","Yeah, no.",That's mine.,That's mine.,"Oh, my gosh.","Also, I thought I'd bring over some fresh oranges for you and Gayle.",Okay.,"Well, that is just so kind, Donna.",Thank you.,"You're one of a kind, Garry.",Oh.,"And I just wanna thank you for taking me down memory lane, ya big Bword.","""Buddy.",""" So much has changed around here.","I just wanted to remember the good old days, when a shoeshine was two bits, and there were no Mexicans in the music business.","If you don't mind, Councilman Milton, we just need to search this stand.",Yes.,Found it.,"""Hi Andy, I hate people, ""but you are okay.",It's weird.,"""Woof, woof.",April.,""" My God, babe, you were so into me.",That's hilarious.,That's it.,It's a dead end.,No more clues.,See me in my office.,"If it makes you feel any better, I had a big crush on you too.",That does make me feel a little better.,Thanks.,Oh!,Thank God.,Get off my boat!,Good afternoon.,I'm here today to share with you all my vision for the economic future of Southern Indiana.,"But first, Leslie Knope, my wife, has a brief statement.","Hello, everyone.",Thank you., Wow., How about this weather we're having? Very temperate., Okay.," Recently, I made an attempt to Actually, hang on.", Stop.," I'm sorry, this whole thing just makes me queasy."," I love how independent my wife is, and because of that, I will not let her speak.", That came out wrong.," The point is, Leslie is a great mother, public servant, all-around person, and I am tired of everybody constantly telling her that she's making the wrong choice."," So you can say whatever you want, I couldn't care less about the political consequences."," Thank you, Ben.", Well., The first thing I'm gonna do is say sorry.," I'm sorry that the spotlight is on me and not on Ben, because he is going to make a great congressman."," Second, the Male Men Where are you? Ah."," You're ridiculous, and men's rights is nothing."," Third, I'm now gonna give you permanent answers to all the silly questions that you're gonna end up asking me, and every other woman in this election, over the next few months."," ""Why did I change my hairstyle?"" Oh, I don't know.", I just thought it would look better., Or my kids got gum in it.," ""Are you trying to have it all?"" That question makes no sense.", It's a stupid question., Stop asking it., Don't ask it.," ""Do you miss your kids while you're at work?"" Yes, of course I do.", Everybody does.," And then, you know, sometimes I don't.", Yeah.," And by the way, no one's ever asked me that question."," No one asks me, ""Where are your kids?"" Or, ""Who's taking care of them?"" By the way, who is taking care of the kids right now? My mom, babe.", Everything's fine., Right.," So, maybe Leslie doesn't fit your personal idea of what a candidate's wife should be."," So what? That's good, because there shouldn't be just one idea anyway.", That's right.," If you wanna bake a pie, that's great."," If you wanna have a career, that's great, too."," Do both, or neither, it doesn't matter.", Just don't judge what someone else has decided to do., We're all just trying to find the right path for us., As individuals., On this Earth., I'd say that's fifty-fifty boos and cheers., Yeah., That seems about right., Let Ben speak! Let Ben speak! He just spoke., Oh., Sorry., I just got here., I had a broken bike chain., My bad., So I guess we are celebrating that you trusted me and I let you down., Great., I change my house locks every 16 days., That key has been useless since the second Tuesday after I gave it to you., What matters is that I trust you and admire you as a person., I will be sorry to see you leave this town., For many reasons., Not the least of which is that you created a puzzle that even I couldn't solve.," And boy, oh, boy, did you love Andy."," ""Woof, woof.",""" It really is embarrassing."," Oh, my God.", I totally know where the key is.," How'd you remember? ""Woof, woof.",""" Bark.", Why here? Because this tree reminds me of you., It's strong., And quiet., And always here when you need it., Or whatever.," I have always felt a certain kinship with April, and this is proof that I was correct."," Not the nice things she said about me, the fact that I buried a large amount of gold under that same tree years ago.", I have since moved it., Or have I? Elise? What did I do wrong now? No.," Actually, we at the IOW loved what you said in your speech."," Really? But What we loved even more was how you, Ben, gave Leslie a platform in which to speak her mind."," Congratulations, Ben Wyatt, you are this year's IOW Woman of the Year.", Son of a bitch.,   ,"

for me.,Increase the perimeter!,"Macklin, the President's called six times.","If we don't get that guitar back, the peace in Iraq will be canceled.","Get off my back, Chief!",I'm doing the best I can.,"I don't play by the rules, but I get results.",Dang it.,"You're right again, Macklin.",And I'm sorry.,You're the best agent I've seen.,And I've worked with James Bond.,This clue may help.,Mmm.,It was left at the crime scene.,You're dismissed.,This case just keeps getting deeper and deeper.,"I'm drowning in the adult end of the pool, and the lifeguard's off in the bathroom pooping.","That's good, right?",Johnny Karate's guitar has been stolen.,That instrument is worth literally $900 million.,"But more importantly, he can't play the goodbye song without it.","So by the time this show is over I will find who stole it, and they will pay the ultimate price.",A oneway ticket to the Funky Monkey Dunk Tank!,All that and more on the Johnny Karate Super Awesome Musical Explosion Show!,"It's time to punch boredom in its stupid face Jump, kick, punch and drop And dropkick sadness into outer space Punch, yeah, till you drop It's the Johnny Karate Super Awesome

of weeks, I'll be moving to Washington, D.",C.,It's the capital of the entire world.,"They have things there like this white house, and this mental institution.","And my very favorite, the Lincoln Memorial.",It's this crazy statue of this giant monster sitting on a chair that represents all of America's enemies.,I'll be moving to Washington D.,C.,"Because my wife, April LudgateKarateDwyer, has accepted an amazing job there.",I'm very proud of her and totally in love.,April!,Why don't you come on out and talk to the children?,Take a bow for being so cool.,"Hey, Johnny!",So since it's your final show I wanted to do one last extra special April's Animal Corner.,That's right.,"This week I brought one of the scariest, weirdest animals in the whole world, Ah Now the name ""Goliath"" means ""giant.",""" And you can see that Andy, where is it?",What?,Uhoh.,Where is it?,Don't look at me.,I don't know what happened.,I took it out to play hide and seek.,I couldn't find it.,And Oh.,That's what happened.,Okay.,"Well, once again, April's Animal Corner has turned into one of our favorite segments.",Yay!,"And as always, when we accidentally end up doing Loose Animal in the Studio, we have to show you this disclaimer.",Boring.,Here's a disclaimer.,I didn't read this disclaimer.,Ooh.,Good point.,Okay.,Done.,"Okay, kids.",So be on the lookout for a What's it called?,A Goliath birdeating tarantula.,"Known locally to Venezuelans as ""The Devil's Fist.",""" Bye, kids.","Okay, kids, well, we've got a lot of work to do performing the Five Karate Moves to Success.",Sing it with me!,Today we're going to And then we'll try something new Oh!,"And finally we'll have some fun Because that's the Johnny Karate way Step one, let's go make something.","Hello, Carpenter Ron.",How are you doing?,My contract is very specific.,I do not have to answer that question.,"This week, I am making a shadowbox frame, which can be used to display an object of great value.",This one is constructed with American cherry wood.,"Cherry, huh?","Now, I have just one question.",No.,The wood does not taste like cherry.,You cannot eat it.,"I was not going to eat it, Carpenter Ron.",I was going to lick it.,"Always remember, kids, when you find something new, you must lick it before you eat it.","That is incorrect, in a number of ways.","I sure have had some fun making things with you, son.",Thank you for everything you've done for the children of this area.,"You're welcome, Carpenter Ron.","Hey, kids.","This, to me, seems like a You are mistaken.",Remove the graphic.,"Well, kids, it's time for our next karate move to success.",Let's learn something.,"Hello, Professor Smartbrain!","Hi, Johnny.","Uh, listen, I don't know if you got my email, but I thought since this is our final show, maybe we not use the Boring Buzzer.","Okay, kids.",Today we're going to learn about geography.,"Now, you, Johnny, are moving to Washington, D.",C.,"I thought what we could talk about is how fast you could get there using an airplane, a train or a car.","Now as you can see, the airplane is the fastest.",Not the fastest.,What about teleporting?,"Well, sure.","That would be really fun, but it's impossible.","Nothing is impossible, kids.",Teleportation is impossible.,It's about theoretical physics.,You asked me to do this.,"This was a favor Morning, Johnny!",Mail call!,"Hi, Mailman Barry!",Who brought me mail today?,"Well, Johnny, you got over 500 letters, from kids who love you, asking for you and April to stay.",Aw.,"Babe, did you hear that?","Now, Johnny, you also got one very special letter.",It's from me.,"And on the last day of your show, I thought I could read it to you.",Aw.,"""Dearest Andy, ""I've never had a son of my own, ""and I just want you to know that for the past 10 years"" It's time to karate chop something!","Ninjas, attack!","Ah, jeez.",Disperse!,"Remember, never attack a real postal employee.",We're allowed to attack Mailman Barry because he volunteered to help us with our karate moves.,I kind of thought I'd be holding a piece of wood or something.,"But, you know, always happy to help.","Next up, we're going to try something new with my good friend Leslie Knope.","Hey, Johnny Karate!",I'm so happy to be here on your last show ever.,"Hi, Leslie.",I'm glad you're here to teach us all how to be brave.,"So, Leslie, what are you going to be trying new this week?",I am going to be taking over hosting my friend's TV show.,Huh?,"Isn't that right, April?",That is right.,"Johnny, you have made so many kids and so many parents so happy that we wanted to give you a proper sendoff.","Andy Dwyer/Johnny Karate, this is your life!","Oh, my gosh.","Leslie, this is amazing.",I don't know what to say.,"Literally, because normally I have a script that I have to stick to.",But I don't know what I'm supposed to say right now.,It's kind of a nightmare.,Okay.,"You leave that to us, Johnny.","Uh, when we come back, we will take a look at the journey of Andy Dwyer.",Stay tuned.,"""Now listen to some words from our sponsors"" are the words I'm saying right now.",Hire Very Good Building Company for your construction needs.,Or do not.,I am not a beggar.,End of commercial.,"The Wamapoke people have a saying, ""Only one who listens hears the cry of the wolf.",""" That advice has been passed down from generation to generation.","Today, I give that advice to you.",Listen for Coinsy the Wolf at Wamapoke Casino.,"Twice a day, one lucky visitor will hit the megawolfjackpot, and Coinsy will howl for you.",The thing we return to now is my Johnny Karate Show return message.,Welcome back.,"When I first met the man standing next to me, he was not a cultural phenomenon.","""Phenomenon"" means ""to explore a cave.",""" He was going through a tough time.",He had just broken both legs from falling into a pit.,I was super wasted.,"It's a kid's show, Andy.",Yes.,Good call.,Kid's show.,Good call.,"That event set in motion many wonderful things in my life, including the building of the Pawnee Commons.","So, in a weird way, Andy, I owe it all to you.","And now that the show is ending, I'm gonna have to start all over again.",Hopefully there's a pit in Washington D.,C.,That I could fall into.,Andy pulled his life together and he got himself a job at the shoeshine stand in City Hall.,He then became a bureaucratic assistant.,"Hi, honey.","Hey, hi.","He was always enthusiastic, but he also kept track of his appointments by writing them on his arm.",Still do!,"To commemorate that time and to make sure that you never miss another appointment again, we have brought you a monogrammed day planner.","Guys, that's so sweet.",Aw.,Thank you.,Aw.,"Oh, no, I lost it.",The day planner's gone.,I can't find it anywhere.,What?,"Fitting, really.","From then, Andy went to England for a few months to work for a nonprofit.","It was there that he befriended the 14th Earl of CornwalluponThames, Sir Edgar Covington.",Tada!,"Oh, my God, Eddie!",This is amazing!,"Andy, I am here in this weird, flat place, to name you a loyal and true karate defender of the Queen's Realm.",Please get down on one knee.,"This honor is bestowed on those who have shown great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science.","Therefore, I hereby dub thee a knight of the Order of the British Empire.",Hang on.,Can you actually do this?,"Well, technically, only the Queen can knight somebody, but I'm so rich that she lets me do what I want.",Would you like to be knighted?,Oh.,"No, no, no.",Of course not.,It's Andy's day.,"Dude, I don't mind.",Oh!,"Then, yes, knight me, please.","Oh, my God, this is amazing.",Winter is coming for Ser Ben Lightstorm.,"Okay, you're both knights.",Cool.,"Guys, this was so much fun.","Friend, coworker, musician, husband Andy Dwyer Sir Andy Dwyer.",Sir Andy Dwyer had become so many things to so many people.,But his greatest creation was yet to come.,A salute to Johnny Karate when we come back!,We know what you want.,"Healthy, natural food that still tastes great.",And we're here to tell you Healthy food is for suckers.,"It tastes like garbage and if you say you like it, you're a chump and a liar.",Be honest.,This is what you want to eat.,It tastes amazing.,What's in it?,How many calories?,It's awesome.,"One of Andy's greatest achievements was the success of his band, Mouse Rat.",No one was doing what we were doing.,"Well, that's not really true.",We were basically playing covers of Dave Matthews songs.,So I guess you could say Dave Matthews was doing what we were doing.,To play in a band like Mouse Rat that brought such joy to so many Truly was a mitzvah.,"I should mention, I'm a rabbi now.","For the full rockumentary, go to And now, back to the show.","Every hero struggles with failure, faces something they cannot do.",Andy faced one of those moments just a few years ago.,"I would've chugged that entire gallon of milk, had I not started puking out of nowhere.","No, you did not achieve your dream of becoming a Pawnee police officer.",Oh.,Right.,"But you did create Burt Macklin, a character who exemplifies everything that is great about law enforcement.",Take a look.,My name is Burt Tyrannosaurus Macklin.,"I don't know what the problem is, Sergeant.",Just drain the ocean.,"Andy, on behalf of the entire Pawnee Police Department, I'd like to present you with this genuine Pawnee police badge.",Wow!,It's ensconced forever in the shadowbox we made earlier.,How about that?,No!,"Son, we spent four days making that.","This means so, so much to me.",I'm a cop!,I should get some handcuffs too!,"Give me your cuffs, Randy.","No, no.",It's an honorary title.,"Stand down, sir.",Quit it!,"Andy, now that you are an official police officer He's not.","I want to make it clear, he's not.",You should be able to solve the case of the missing guitar.,"So, grab your clue and head on over to Professor Smartbrain.","Professor Smartbrain, this piece of fabric was found at the scene.",Look at it under your telescope.,Hmm.,It looks like there are some tiny initials.,"""J.",C?,""" President Jimmy Carter stole my guitar?",But why?,"I don't think it's Jimmy Carter, buddy.",The champ is here!,"Hi, kids.",Is everybody having a great time?,I know I am!,John Cena in the house!,"John Cena, you're my hero!",Wait.,You're Andy.,Yeah.,I'm Andy.,From the information I got I just assumed you'd be like 10 years old.,Thank you.,"That's Okay, great.",Thank you.,"Thank you so much, man, For bringing martial arts and music to all the children.","Wait, wait, wait.","What are you doing, man?",Gotcha!,Got me?,Wait.,What?,He got my cuffs.,Wait.," What the hell is this?  Oh! John Cena, you're a great inspiration, a true hero, and this is the greatest moment of my life.", But you're going down., Going down? What are you doing Whoa! Stop! You stole Johnny Karate's guitar.," I didn't steal his guitar, man.", I'm just doing this as a favor.," You're going in the dunk tank, bud.", I don't wanna go in the dunk tank., Shut up.," Is anybody in charge? Uh, a little help? And now it's time to celebrate Andy Dwyer's greatest creation, Johnny Karate.", He has brought so much happiness to so many children in southern Indiana that we thought a piece of Johnny Karate should stay here in Pawnee., Everybody was kung fu fighting Raise it up! Those cats were fast as lightning This is awesome.," Can you believe it, babe? In fact it was a little bit frightening That karate gi will stay here forever."," Well, not here, here, because this studio actually has a show where divorced couples work out their problems, so that might be weird if that thing was hanging over them.", But it'll be somewhere., And the spirit will stay with us., Forever.," Andy Dwyer's final goodbye, when we come back."," What powers us? What gives us the tools to attain our goals, face our fears, take that next step into the unknown? It's energy."," Verizon, Exxon and Chipotle are proud to announce a cross-platform merger of our three great brands."," Whether it's extending your 6G coverage, drilling natural gas out of shale or perfecting the chicken quesadilla, we will give you the energy to get you to the next level."," And with enough energy, America, nothing can stop us.", The all-new Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon., I'd like to begin by saying thank you to anyone who has ever worked on the Johnny Karate Musical Explosion Show.," This has been the greatest job I've ever had, and today has been the best day of my life.", And that's saying something., I once found a rock that looked exactly like Santa Claus.," Hat and everything, so Before I say goodbye, let's review our checklist one last time.", We made something with Carpenter Ron., We learned something with Professor Smartbrain.," We karate-chopped something, old Mailman Barry's face."," And we tried something new, even though it was scary to us, with Leslie Knope.", That leaves just one more thing., The most important one., And I think I know right now who needs it the most.," My wife, April Ludgate-Karate-Dwyer."," Honey, come on out here.", Come here., Babe., Hey.," Babe? Wait! Honey, where are you going? Babe.", Hey.," Where are you Hey, come here."," April, what's going on? It's Every week this show is an amazing train wreck, and you love doing it, and you're the best host."," Like, even better than my all-time favorite host, Tom Snyder, which is crazy."," And all those kids love you, and you're doing what you're meant to do.", And I can't be the person that makes you lose what you love.," Yeah, but you're what I love.", You're the only reason I have any of this.," You believed in me, and you supported me, and you make me happy.", Happier than I ever thought I could be.," All right, without you, I wouldn't be anything.", You're what keeps me going., You're my Verizon-Chipotle-Exxon.," As long as I'm with you, I'm going to be happy.", So we go to Washington D.,C., And then we figure out the next cool and awesome thing from there., Okay? Okay.," Well, that was a very good Being Nice To Someone.", I did it., Now I can go finish the show.," Well, it's time for us to go But I want you to all to know That karate's not about fighting It's about knowing who you are And being kind and honest While you're kicking for the stars Yeah, that's the Johnny Karate way Keep karate in your heart And aspire to your dreams And always remember you're forever on my team Yeah, that's the Johnny Karate way Karate yell! Hiya! Goodbye, Pawnee! I will miss you."," Guys? Guys? Guys! Tarantula! Could somebody get me outta here? Please? I'll help you, John Cena.", No.,   ,"
                ",Season: 7 Episode: 11,Hey.,"Hey, guys.",Listen.,"Uh, Leslie's gonna walk in and say something that sounds very boring, but is actually a really big deal.","So when I give the signal, just, everybody, cheer like crazy.",Here we go.,"Well, someone just officially enrolled in the Senior Executive Service Development Candidate Program at the Department of the Interior.",Surprise!,Thanks.,It's a big deal.,"So, my promotion is official.",We need to find a place in D.,C.,Because we're gonna be splitting our time.,I guess now is as good a time as any to make my announcement.,Joe and I just closed on a house in Seattle.,"Oh, my God.",Cheers.,"Well, actually, I have an announcement, too.","After all these years in government, I have decided to finally retire.","This is about people who are moving, Garry.",Not everything is about you.,Good point.,Everyone's scattering.,"Well, look at it this way.","Bad news comes in threes, right?","We're leaving, April and Andy are leaving, Donna's leaving.",That's three!,"Also, I'm retiring.","That's three, Garry.","Well, we're probably due for some good news.",Good evening.,I come to you tonight with some good news.,Hey.,Is not a sentence I will be saying to you right now.,"Because, beloved Pawnee Mayor Walter Gunderson has died.","Well, you jinxed us, Garry.",Thanks a lot.,Walter Gunderson served Pawnee for 39 years.,"And as per his final wish, his body will lie in state, in the city council chambers for a day.",Which is just a real cool thing for a public space.,"Also, he sent us a brief video message to be played for this event.","Hello, Pawnee.",My time in office has come to an end.,A lot has been done.,But I wasn't really doing very much.,I wasn't paying attention most of the time.,"Fortunately, the citizens of Pawnee didn't pay attention either.","So, uh, if there's credit to take, I will humbly take it.","And if there is blame, it's your fault.",Thank you.,And goodbye forever.,"Uh, okay.","Well, that was really something.","People are dying, moving, retiring.","Too many endings, not enough beginnings.",We need something to begin.,And I have just the thing.,An underground dance competition.,I'm realizing I know nothing about the logistics of how to start an underground dance competition.,But someone here will.,"Hey, April.",Will you help me out with something?,No.,"Apparently, as city manager, I'm in charge of appointing an interim mayor until the special election.","So, why don't you just appoint yourself?",You're basically running the town anyway.,"Well, I was a mayor once before.",We all remember how that went.,"Oh, yeah, you completely disgraced yourself and destroyed an entire town.","Yeah, I said we all remember.",Now will you help me find someone?,It can be anyone over the age of 30 who's a good symbolic face for the town.,"Fine, whatever, I'll help you.",Okay?,Thank you.,I told Garry he could help too.,What?,"Oh, notarizing a new mayor, that is Well, it's like the ultimate notary adventure.","Oh, it's big.",LesLegally Blonde.,Got you a little gift in New York.,You did.,What did you get me?,Oohlala.,Men's Ferragamo loafers.,What am I supposed to do with these?,"Yeah, you're right, I should probably keep 'em.","They're a size six and a half, too small for you anyway.",How was your trip?,Amazing.,Lot of great meetings.,"Plus, Lucy and I had the best time.","It's for real, Leslie.",We even went to a jewelry store and looked at rings.,No.,"Shia LaBeouf is one hell of a jewelry designer, by the way.",The man's really found his calling.,This is perfect.,"What with everything ending, you guys are the happy beginning that we all need.",You should propose to her.,Right now.,Here.,What better place to ask a woman to marry you than an old man's public memorial?,Yeah.,I think I'm probably gonna wait.,"Plus, Lucy's not in town.",She's in Philadelphia visiting friends.,She gets back tomorrow.,"Yeah, you'd probably want her here for that, right?",All right.,I'm gonna find April.,I got her a really nice Burberry necktie.,Gunderson was mayor my entire life.,It really makes you consider the postulence of time.,Sure.,"Death is natural, Andrew.","We're born, we survive as long as we're useful, and then we're killed, either by our body's natural decay or by those younger and stronger.",Speak for yourself.,"Before I die, I'm freezing my head like Ted Williams.","Wait a thousand years, thaw it out, slap it on a robot,  Keep on ballin'.",Ron.,Carl.,"Donna, Andy, this is Carl.",He owns the deli right next to my barber Salvatore's shop.,"It's terrible, isn't it?",First Salvatore and now Mayor Gunderson.,What?,What happened?,Explain yourself.,"Oh, Ron, you didn't hear?",Salvatore passed away yesterday.,No.,Jesus.,"Oh, it can't be.","Was he killed by a younger, stronger barber?","And now, here to say a few words is Mayor Gunderson's longtime friend and coworker, Ethel Beavers.",This is gonna be so sad.,They worked together for a long time.,I'll be brief.,Walter Gunderson and his wife had an open marriage.,It kept him happy.,It kept his wife happy.,"Hi, Evelyn.",And it definitely kept me happy.,What is happening?,"Because for 46 wonderful years, he spent night after night exploring every nook and cranny of my body.","Grow up, you prudes.",We're all adults.,My only regret is that I never told him how I really felt.,"So, I'll say it now.","I loved that man, and not just because he was a dynamite lay.","Goodnight, you animal.",Tom.,Listen to Ethel.,Mmm.,"No, it's too gross.",No.,Listen to her message.,You can't wait to tell someone how you feel.,"Because if you wait, before you know it Boom!","Fortysix years later, they're gone.",You're right.,"We know we want to be together forever, so why wait?",Exactly.,And I will help you with the proposal.,What do you wanna do?,"Off the top of my head, I guess, my ideal proposal might be a multiplatform media experience.","An action movie, with explosive graphics, fast cars and a hero with one mission, to propose to his lady.",A hero named Tom Haverford.,"Oh, yeah!",Yes!,"Oh, um People grieve in different ways.","Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out ""Lucy, will you marry me?",""", then you have no business calling yourself a pet store.",Why can't everyone share our commitment to the basic concept of outrageous pageantry?,"I don't know, Tom.",I really don't.,"Oh, no.","What do you want, Leslie?","Hey, lan.","I need a gigantic banner that says ""Congratulations, Lucy and Tom,"" and I need it by tomorrow.",No way.,Impossible.,"Over the past 15 years, I have spent nearly a hundred thousand dollars at your banner store.",I have ordered banners for every personal and professional event that I've ever organized.,"My credit card company called me about it, not to question the charges, but to sincerely ask me if I was mentally stable.","See that Rolex Submariner on your wrist, bro.",That's 'cause of Leslie.,You'll have the banner done.,"Hey, Bobby.",Thanks for coming in.,Good to see you guys.,It's been a while.,How's Leslie?,"Is she still, um Uh Oh.","What was that thing we ran for, again?",City Councilor.,"Well, all right.",If you say so.,"I tell ya, it's so hard to remember boring stuff like that.","Choosing to ignore what you just said, we need an interim mayor, just for two months.","And given your family name and how wellliked you are, I thought you might be interested.","What, mayor?",Yeah.,"Man, that would be fun.","God, I don't think I can do it, though.","Yeah, 'cause I'm getting ready to go on a big trip.",To space.,"That'll be really fun, too.","Everything in life is always just so fun, right?",It really is.,"See, this guy knows what's what.",Yeah.,"Ooh, uh What's that?","Hey, Ben, have you ever been to space?",You should check it out.,Seriously.,I'm sure the Russian guys who built the rocket would be cool with it.,Really?,Just one thing.,"Do you have $600,000?",That's what they need for the deposit.,Oh.,"Well, no.",APRIL: I've already been to space.,I was the second person to walk on the moon.,"Buzz Aldrin, nice to meet you.",Nice try.,That's the guy from Toy Story.,"We're so sorry, Ron.",You guys were close?,I've seen Salvatore the first Tuesday of the month for the past four decades.,Same exact thing every time.,I paid him $8.,"I sat in the same chair, Salvatore put the same cape over me.",And then he'd always ask me about the same thing.,Nothing.,It was perfect.,I can't delay this forever.,Excuse me.,"The three most important people in a man's life are his barber, his butcher and his lover.",I have lost one of those.,"Here's a tenner, Sal.","As you know I don't believe in tipping, so I will collect my change from your wife.",I had an appointment with Salvatore scheduled for Tuesday.,Look how raggedy my hair is.,"What am I supposed to be, some kind of rock star?","Okay, Tom, there's your mark, you'll enter from the front.","Ted, are we rolling?",I think so.,I don't really know.,Just please be careful with my store?,Okay!,Quiet on the set!,Action.,"'Allo, would you like to see some rings, Agent Haverford?",Why are you doing an accent?,I came up with a backstory for my character.,"She's married to a French billionaire, and she has a twin sister, identical, and they keep Leslie, you have one line.","Well, I committed to the role!",'Allo.,Would you like to see some gorgeous jewelry?,We have the most rare diamonds in the world.,I'll take that one.,The most expensive one.,"Not so fast, Haverfraud.",Oh.,Zut alors!,"Get him, boys.",Freeze.,Stunt

gosh.","Tom, that was amazing!","No, it wasn't.",You just destroyed my case.,Hey.,"It's the movie business, Ted.",You knew the risks.,"Okay, everybody in the van.",We're headed to the next location.,You should totally do it.,You'd be an amazing mayor.,"Actually, you should be President.",Of the universe.,Oh.,"You know, I really would make an incredible mayor.","But sadly, I cannot.",Because I'm only 27 years old.,Really?,"So, you were born in the 1990s?",Ooh!,Mmmhmm.,"What a lovely offer, but I think not.","You know, I've got my hands full with my practice, my other businesses, my two terrible children.",I don't think I have time to be mayor.,Hold up.,"I will do John Mayer, again.","Daddy, someone set a fire in your car because you took too long and I got bored.","Money, please.","Oh, no.","No, there's no money.",Oh.,"My bad, no problem.","Oh, okay.",That's fine.,"Um, I'll just destroy this office.",Whoa!,Hey!,"Money, please!","Money, please.",I Ben.,Give her some money.,It's easier.,"I have to say, The Douche, I'm skeptical that your interest is sincere.",I can understand that.,A morning shockjock DJ the Mayor?,But keep an open mind.,I went to Northwestern.,"I've worked on two political campaigns, and I spend all of my time communicating with the public.",That's actually a good point.,I could do some great things for this city.,And some gross things with those juicy City Hall interns.,Ahguhguhgoink!,Okay.,Well.,Thanks for coming in.,"All right, ""B"".",Let me know.,Yeah.,Ah.,"Well, I think we have our answer.","Oh, come on.",Think.,There's got to be someone.,Okay.,Ben.,"You know that I despise you, and that I want you and all people on Earth to be miserable.",Right?,Sure.,You should be mayor.,You're the best person for the job and you deserve it.,"Plus, this would erase Ice Town.",It's been torturing you since you were 18 years old.,"And if you became Mayor of Pawnee, you could put it behind you, once and for all.",Ugh.,Being nice made me feel terrible.,My oral office.,What?,I'm gonna turn the mayoral office into my oral office.,Boom!,"Thought of it a second ago, had to pop back in.","""Had to""?",Had to.,"Buck up, Swanson.","It's like you said, death is natural.","And Sal lived a good, long life.","But so much is changing, and I've never been a fan of change.",Salvatore was a constant in my life.,"In my experience, the only ""constant"" is change.","Oh Nice to see you, Ron.",I couldn't help but overhear.,I sure am sorry about your loss.,"Every time we lose a compadre, our collective lantern gets a little bit dimmer.","Hey, you look awful familiar.",Have we met before?,I'm sure our souls have collided in one lifetime or another.,"No, that's not it.",Are you in my Frisbee golf league?,"Oh, yeah.",I play for the Super Spinners.,Oh.,I'm on the Frisbee Champs.,"Ah, cool.",I named us.,"Andrew, stop speaking to this man.",He is the worst human being on Earth.,"Oh, come on.",Death makes brothers of us all.,"I've always found that when my soul aches with loss, it's best to turn to Eastern wisdom.",This is from the Isle of Islay in Scotland.,This is as eastern as my wisdom gets.,"Swanson, this handsome spiritual cowboy may actually be right about turning to the east.",I have an idea.,Trust me?,Who cuts your hair?,Nobody.,"Whenever my hair feels it has completed its journey, it simply sheds itself off.",I hate you so much.,"And I love you, my brother.",I'm really glad you were here to help me with all this today.,"You've always been there for me, and I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're pretty cool.",I'm cool?,I'm cool.,I'm a cool dudette.,Hey.,It's pizza time.,And you've lost it.,No.,"Hey, there's Lucy.","Hey, babe.",We're calling this off.,It's all wrong.,"Oh, no!",Really?,"Is it because I said, ""It's pizza time""?","No, but that definitely didn't help.",What's happening?,"Grab JeanRalphio, and get these three things.",And meet me at the Snakehole Lounge in 30 minutes.,"I have no idea what's happening, and I'm very scared that everything is falling apart.",But you seem like James Bond right now.,Go!,Yes.,"Tommy ""T"", we got you everything you asked for.",I didn't ask for flavored condoms.,"Oh, no, no, that's just me looking out for you.","See, girls get mad horny when you propose.",That's why I do it all the time.,"Okay, what are we doing?",There are hundreds of people waiting for us.,"No time to explain, Les, but don't worry, I have a plan.",Fine.,I will leave.,Good luck.,You wanna stay and hide and watch the proposal?,Yes.,"Yes, of course!","Okay, I already picked a place.",Don't follow me!,But I'm gonna.,I'm gonna.,I can't believe I'm about to be the mayor.,I can't believe I'm about to notarize it.,Okay.," So, look, just sign right there and then we can let the notary fireworks begin! No.", I don't wanna do this.," Why? I spent so long trying to forget about Ice Town, but it's part of my life.", It set me on this path.," It led me to Pawnee, to my job, to Leslie.", Who knows where I'd be without it., I like that Ice Town happened., And I don't wanna erase it., Okay.," I wasn't listening to anything you just said, but who is gonna be the mayor for the next two months then? Garry Gergich."," How would you like to be the next mayor of Pawnee, Indiana? No! What is all this? The Snakehole Lounge is where we first met."," On our first date, I gave you a single daisy, like this.", And after that we ate late night pancakes at J.,J.,'s.," And while we were there, I pulled out a deck of cards, and I tried to show you a magic trick I learned on a David Blaine special."," Unsurprisingly, I failed, and you made fun of me, ruthlessly."," I haven't done this trick in a while, but I think I'm ready to try it again.", Pick a card.," No, no, no.", Go a little bit over to the left., There you go., Yes! Really? Yes.," Yay! Oh, my God.", That was so sweet., It really was.," So, what's your story again? I mean, how married are you? Are you down to clown? You in that rude mood? Why are you like this? Pills, baby! Donna, this is crazy.", Typhoon is an artist and the human head is Is his canvas., Just listen.," You're gonna cut the man's hair, you're gonna charge him $8.", It will take you four minutes., So just shut up and make the man look like this., Fine., Ugh.," So, Typhoon, what do you like to do for fun? I'm writing an electronic opera about Brittany Murphy, and I do the chandelier design for my friend's drag puppet show.", No further questions., All I really want to do is dance.," Except lately, all the good warehouse raves are filled with Euro trash.", Euro trash., I like that.," It is, indeed, a garbage continent.", Yes.," Oh, my God, I had the worst time in Berlin last May.", Everyone was on their stupid bikes.," I was like, ""Ew""."," Please, talk more about how you hate Europe and bicycles.", Sorry about the audible., I just realized Lucy doesn't care about all that flashy stuff., That's not the way to her heart.," Frankly, I'm stunned she's still even into me.", No., You were right to change course., It was perfect and beautiful., There's still a very big celebration awaiting you and your fiance.," I think Lucy probably wants to hang, just the two of us."," I'll see you later, Jennifer Knope-ez."," Catch you on the flipside, Tom-egranate Juice."," Hey, not bad."," Hey, babe.", Tom got engaged.," Oh, that's awesome."," More good news, I finally found someone to be mayor.", Garry., Ugh., I'm so glad we're leaving., Wait., You know what? I just had an amazing idea., Just under the wire.," Oh, Ian, thank you so much.", It's great.," Now, throw it out."," I need a new one, and I need it in 20 minutes.", Look.," If you didn't wanna be on call 24/7 for emergencies, then you should not have gone into the high-stakes world of banner making! What the hell is all this about? You'll see."," Well, I got to say, that was a heck of a lot of fun."," All my life What on Earth? I prayed for someone like you Happy Inauguration Day, buddy."," Aw, jeez."," Leslie I thank God That I That I finally found you All my life, I pray for someone like you And I hope that you feel the same way, too Yes, I pray that you The passing of our beloved Mayor Gunderson marks the end of an era.", But we are about to begin a new chapter in Pawnee's history.," Ladies and gentlemen, the new mayor of the great city of Pawnee, Indiana, Garry Gergich! I just wanna say And I hope that you feel the same way, too I'm flying! Yes, I pray that you do love me too   ","

hired.","Perhaps we could skip ahead, and just hit the highlights?","I mean, I planned a comprehensive retrospective, but I guess I can just focus on the really important moments.",Ah!,The debate about getting a podbased coffee machine.,Garry and I wrote a little musical number about that.,And it goes a little something like this.,"Why can't we just quickly shake hands, pretend we liked each other, and get out of here?",I'm all for that.,"No, April, Ron, we need to celebrate everything that we've done together as a group.",This is our last day here.,Who knows when we'll all be together like this again?,Excuse me.,Hi.,There's a swing in a park near my house that's been broken for about three months.,Is it possible to get that fixed?,"""Anything is possible, if you follow your dreams.",""" Johnny Karate.",Except getting a swing fixed.,None of us actually work here anymore.,Come back in two hours when the office is open.,Thank you.,Wait.,"Actually, sir, we can help.","We can, and we will.","Because when we used to work here, helping people was our job.",Forget about these old stories.,Let's make a new one.,Let's fix the swing.,One last ride for the Parks and Rec gang.,Who's in?,Yeah!,"The vote was four to three Donna said to get rid of me But Ron was suspicious Because my coffee was delicious Come on, Garry.",You're the mayor now.,Have

Hufflepuff.,"Well, everything is paperless now.",And none of us has a login.,So we can't access the computers.,Hang on.,I have one right here.,"Thanks to Leslie's scrapbook, ""Thanks Form the Memories"".",I knew those scrapbooks were going to come in handy.,You came through like you always do.,"God, I'm going to miss you.","Your confidence, your joie de vivre.",That crazy story about you getting kicked out of En Vogue.,"Technically, I kicked them out.",When do you leave for Seattle?,Soon as I get my local real estate license.,"I'm married to a teacher, and I love the man, but I also love diamond watches.","Well, whatever happens, I know that you are going to live an exciting and full life.","Thirtyfour hundred square feet, a beautiful view of Puget Sound, and if you look out this window, you can watch them build the new Space Haystack around the Space Needle.",Wow.,I can hardly see the needle anymore.,"I know, that's kind of the point.","So, what are we thinking?",Wow.,It sold in two hours?,You cannot beat the Seattle real estate market.,"I think it's all that coffee and legal marijuana, has people wanting to buy houses quickly and irrationally.",Mmm.,But the giant commission check has me thinking about Mmmhmm?,DonnaJoe Adventure Quest.,Ooh!,Where are we going?,"Well, it can't beat last year.","I mean, Middle Korea is so beautiful.",Here's my idea.,The Amazon.,Oh!,Three weeks of the best and most expensive places South America has to offer.,I love it.,"Honestly, with the way work is going, I just need this right now.",The school cut the math club.,And math.,They just don't teach math anymore.,Oh.,My poor little dogooder teacher baby.,"Why don't we cuddle up on the couch, watch a movie, and then maybe later, I'll wear that little red thing?","Yes, the red thing.","Here, let me get this.",Call Satan's Niece.,"Hey, what do you want?",And this is me DJing a boat party in Venezuela.,Kind of reminded me of the two weeks you and I spent there.,"Oh, yeah.",That happened.,"Yeah, it did.",April!,What are you doing here?,"Babe, have a seat.",What's going on?,"Recently, I was thinking, for the millionth time, how lucky I am to have found you.","So, I've decided to treat yo' self.",You're going to buy me a bunch of leather handbags?,Donna is going to take some of the money you usually use on your trips and establish an education program through the foundation I work for.,It's called Teach Yo' Self.,And you and the other teachers will get money for afterschool programs.,"For music, art, math, whatever you want.","Baby, this is really generous.",But I love our trips.,"And honestly, it's your money.",You should spend it how you want.,This is what I want.,I've had a lot of adventures.,I singlehandedly started that doorknockers earring trend.,I came in ninth in Italy's Got Talent.,Yeah.,I served on a NASCAR pit crew.,"I want a new kind of

of Pawnee.,"Craig, can you sign the requisition form?",It will speed things up.,"You know, Craig, when I first met you, I thought, ""There is a man who loves his job.",""" And then I thought, ""Oh, wow, he's intense.",""" And then I thought, ""Oh, no, he's insane.","""That person is psychotic, and I need to call the police.",""" Yeah, that's usually the way it goes.",But I just think you've come so far.,And I'm so glad that we are leaving the Parks Department in your hands.,"Funny though it's true Those silly things you do They only bring me Closer to you Nice crooning, buddy.","The gentleman over by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card.",Okay.,"So, as you all know Okay, fine.",We are gathered here today to join Craig Middlebrooks and Typhoon Montalban in holy matrimony.,I don't know about this.,I'm very scared.,"Oh, just relax, you nervous nelly.",You're right.,"We love each other, and the tax break is substantial.",Will the best man please present the rings?,"Good luck, you two.","Typhoon, my love, happy anniversary.",Do you have any regrets?,Not one.,Not a single one.,Do you have any regrets?,Are you

people.","Hi, April.",I'm going to miss the food in Pawnee.,"Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut.","But most of all, I'm going to miss you, Leslie.","Oh, Andy, all of those things, including me, will still be with you in Washington.",That is a beautiful sentiment.,I just want to say that we are about to embark on an amazing adventure.,"And whatever happens, just know that Ben and I are always there for you.",Mmm.,"Agent Macklin, I need you.",Some thieves are trying to steal the legendary Snakehole Sapphire.,What the No!,That sapphire has the power to activate the Cuban Missile

you?,"Yes, but that's not what's wrong.",It's just Seeing all those kids out there Babe.,"I want to put a babe in you, babe.","Andy, you know where I stand on this.","Yes, I would love all the awesome stuff my body would go through.","I mean, if all it meant was puking and getting weird stretch marks and veins everywhere, then sign me up.","But at the end, we've brought a child into the world?",That's disgusting.,No.,They wipe all of the disgusting stuff off of it immediately.,We're going to be late for dinner.,Okay.,Let's go.,Hey!,Come on in.,Hey!,Always nice to see Janet

where are the kids at?",I want to say hi and wrestle all three of them at once.,"Oh, they're trickortreating in Georgetown with some friends.",It's just us grownups tonight.,No kids at all.,"Hey, Andy, why don't you give me a hand in the kitchen?",So?,What do you need a hand with?,"Oh, no, I just thought you might want to talk.",Whoa!,"Dude, that's really slick.","Man, that's some secret agent stuff right there.","So, April's still on the fence about kids, huh?","Yeah, and I'm freaking out, man.",I want kids so bad.,"You know, yesterday, I was at the park, and I saw this group of eightyearolds laughing and playing and having a good time.",I almost started crying.,"Granted, I had just faceplanted on my rollerblades.",That's what they were laughing at.,Sure.,"All right, go ahead.",What?,You're going to lecture me about how Andy and I should have kids.,"You're going to be like, ""They're so great.",They change your life.,"""And yes, they drive you nuts, but it's all worth it ""for the beauty and the majesty and the glory ""of their little faces in the morning.",""" Blah, blah, blah and barf.",You know why it's so unfair?,Because you guys got so lucky.,"You had sex one time and you had three kids and they're all, like, smart and great and healthy.","And now, your lives are perfect.",But our life is pretty perfect already.,And you know what?,Kids act the opposite of their parents.,That's why your kids are so cool.,"But Andy and I are cool already, so our kids will be, like, really lame and weird.",I'm sorry.,I just don't know what to do.,Please tell me what to do.,What do I do?,It's not about trying to make your life perfect.,Nobody's lives are perfect.,"You have kids because you and Andy are a team, and you want to bring in some new team members.","So, you think we should?",I don't know if you should have kids.,I really don't.,But I do like your team.,"All right, Ms.",Ludgate.,We're getting close.,"Babe, you look more beautiful right now than I have ever seen you.",Wow.,Just your luck that you're going into labor on Halloween.,Can I get a warm towel to get that makeup off?,No!,I want it on.,That's the whole point.,I put the makeup on after I went into labor.,Whatever blows your skirt up.,Okay.,You ready to push?,"Wait, no, babe, my birth mix.",Oh.,He did the mash Here comes a contraction.,Are you ready?,"Okay, I'm ready.",Let's do this.,It was a graveyard smash He did the mash It caught on in a flash He did the mash He did the monster mash From the laboratory in the

later.,"Congrats, guys.","I know it came unexpectedly early, but pretty cool he was born in Pawnee.",Where do I put these?,"I have so many presents, it's weird.",Yes!,"Oh, for the baby?",Just put them over there.,What's his name?,Jack.,That's good.,"Welcome to the team, little guy.",Take this down to maintenance.,"I know just where to take it, Ethel.",And I know just the person who should accompany me.,I'm a little busy right now.,"Not you, Kyle.","How many times did you and I deliver a form to maintenance, just like this?","Oh, so many great conversations, bonding and mentoring moments.",It seems only right that we make this journey one final time.,"What was that, booboo?",Nothing.,Ohhh!,Tommy T and Sexy Lexy Knope.,What are you two bad Larrys up to?,"Well, this is our last day in Pawnee and we have one last problem to fix.",Hold up.,You're leaving?,For truth?,I am going to miss you so much.,What's going on?,You're not injured?,"Uh, yeah, I'm injured.","I got a terminal case of ""get me to the front of the line at Six Flags!",""" Shaboosh!",It's a winter wonderland!,I'm going to be so sad to see you go.,Will you do me one final kindness?,"Will you pretend to be my wife for an insurance scam, but then we fall in love for real?","Also, can I have a pair of your gym socks?",And don't worry.,It's not for anything weird.,It's just a fetish I have.,JeanRalphio.,Yeah.,"Although I truly hope that I never see you again, I do wish you a long and happy life.",Today we say goodbye to JeanRalphio Saperstein.,"As per his last will and testament, we will now listen to his favorite song, Bend Over, by Lil Jon featuring Tyga.",Bend over make your knees touch your elbows Bend over make your knees touch your elbows Whoo!,"Okay, okay, they bought it.",They bought it.,Do you have the insurance money?,"No doubt, no doubt.","Let's hit it, bro.","Time to start a casino in Uh, Tajikistan Down in the ground Talking about Tajikistan!","Shh, shh, shh.",JeanRalphio?,Go!,"Go, go, go, go!",Tajikistan or die!,Tajikistan or die!,Tajikistan or die!,Tajikistan or die!,So Tom and I have a swing to fix.,Let's go.,Leslie?,I've always loved you.,I know.,"Oh, man, I forgot that maintenance was closed on Fridays.",What would our last ride be without one more bureaucratic snafu?,"Don't worry, booboo.","Tommy will solve this problem, no sweat.","Can I just say, Tom, you have accomplished so much, you have come so far, now you're so successful Don't forget welldressed.","Yes, and welldressed.",I am so very proud of you.,"Thanks, Leslie.","I'm proud of me, too.","Nice crooning, buddy.","Uh, the gentleman by the bar there sent you over this glass of wine, and his business card.",Okay.,"So, as you all know, Tom's Bistro has been presented with a huge expansion opportunity, and I don't want to make a decision until I hear from my senior advisory board.","So, is this a good idea?",Accounting Nerd.,"I'm a congressman, Tom.",Can you at least call me Ben?,"No can do, Accounting Nerd.",We all knew you before you were a big shot.,Let's keep the whining to a minimum.,"Well, there are always going to be risks when you open new restaurants.",But you've done your homework.,All the numbers line up.,"Sidenote, I would again strongly recommend adding calzones to the menu.",Ugh.,The worst.,Ron?,"It's a bold capitalistic gambit, son.","But nothing ventured, nothing gained.",Regal Meagle?,Real estate is pretty cheap right now.,"If you're going to do it, this is a good time.",Okay.,I'm doing it.,"Over the next five years, there's going to be 20 Tom's Bistros across America.","Look out, world.",Tommy's about to blow up.,"And blow up he did, but not in a good way.",He lost everything.,"Today, Tom Haverford is broke, destitute.","And worst of all, swaggerless.","Tommy, you've got to stop watching this.",I can't tear myself away.,It's a whole documentary about my failures.,That you made!,I had to.,I have to remember every tiny awful aspect of this.,"I lost everything, Lucy.","The franchises, most of my money I had to sell my pocket square collection!",What are people's eyes going to be drawn to?,"Look, you had a tough break.","The stock market tanked, credit dried up.",Who could have predicted that the country would run out of beef?,You've just got to move on.,"That's the problem, though.","I've gone bust in the past, but it was because I did something reckless.","This time, I was smart and careful, and I still went broke.",What do I do now?,"Well, you and I are going to be fine.",And you'll come up with a new idea.,You always do.,I once started It failed in four months.,I opened a clothing rental store.,I built a restaurant empire.,They all failed.,But the story of America isn't about second or third chances.,"It's about fourth, fifth, sixth, twentieth, fiftieth chances.",That's how long it took me to get where I am today.,An American Success Story.,"As you know if you've read the book, I've outlined seven different types of successful people.",You can be an Andy.,An April.,A Ben.,A Leslie.,A Ron.,A Donna.,Or my personal favorite.,A Tom.,But what do we definitely not want to be?,A Garry!,That's right.,Do not be a Garry.,He's talking about me.,Hey.,Hey!,"Thanks so much for coming, guys.",Are you kidding?,"Tom, this is incredible.","A bestselling book, a 40city tour.","Well, I couldn't have done it without you.","Well, the book is called Failure.",I don't know how to take that.,I'm serious.,You guys have always supported me.,"Here, I inscribed you a copy.","""When I think of success, I think of you.","""You are a true inspiration to me.","""I love you.",Tom Haverford.,""" Oh, sorry, that's actually for Kendrick Lamar.",Here's yours.,"""Best wishes.",""" And I mean every word of it.","So, how are we going to fix this swing?",Hold a public forum?,Have a rally?,Smash that door and do some looting?,"Actually, I think there's a simpler solution.",We just need the help of the most powerful man in Pawnee.,"Jim, how the heck are you?","Yeah, look, I hate to bother you, but I'm here with my two best friends, Leslie Knope and Tom Haverford.",Shh.,And we need the firstfloor maintenance room open.,Mmm.,"Okay, great.",And best to Louise and the girls.,"Okay, byebye.",You guys are all set.,"Thank you, Mayor Gergich.",You really saved our butts.,I am so happy that you get to be mayor.,Are you enjoying yourself?,"Oh, are you kidding me?","Leslie, I know that this is purely ceremonial and it will be over in just a couple of weeks, but I just don't know how my life could get any better than this.","In a turn of events both shocking and unexpected, interim mayor Garry Gergich was officially elected today, thanks to a massive writein campaign.","Mayor Gergich, what are your plans for your first actual term?","Oh, geez.","Uh, you know what, I have no idea, Perd.","I mean, this is so crazy.","I just hope I do a good job, and I promise I'm going to try my best.","And faithfully serve the people of Pawnee, Indiana.","As President of City Council, I, Councilwoman Brandi Maxxxx, star of more than 11,000 adult films in the last two years, officially declare Garry Gergich Mayor of Pawnee, Indiana, for the fourth time.","Thank you, Pawnee!","Okay, great.","Garry Gergich, you are now mayor, again, for the tenth time, proving conclusively that in these corporate states of America, it's the entrenched powers who hold all the cards.","Thank you, Councilman Morris.","Thank you, Pawnee!","Happy birthday, my sweet, sweet husband.",We all love you so much.,I have had the perfect life.,I have had the perfect marriage.,Oh.,The perfect children and the perfect grandchildren and greatgrandchildren.,And I just want you to know how much I love you.,Okay.,"Come on, everybody.","Say ""Gergich.",""" Gergich!","Mayor Garry Gergich died peacefully, in his sleep, on his 100th birthday, holding the hand of his beloved wife, Gayle.",Mmm.,Gayle looks amazing.,"Yeah, yeah, I know.","He will now be given the Indiana Notary Society's highest honor, the 21Stamp Salute.","Rest in peace, friend.",They spelled his name wrong on the tombstone.,Close enough.,Hmm.,It's time to go.,Okay.,How's this for a headline?,Parks Gang Reunites for One Last Bang.,""" That's a little dirty.","Well, it's a headline, Shauna.",Sex sells.,Knope.,Make yourself useful and hand me that crescent wrench.,"Well Not bad craftsmanship, Ron.",It is perfect craftsmanship.,I calculate the cost of my labor at $38.,I can send the bill to you?,"So, you think you're going to stick around Pawnee?","Oh, I imagine so.","Not sure where I would go, really.","Well, we're going to come back here a lot.",You know what they say.,Don't be a stranger.,"Despite the recent financial crisis, Very Good Building Company will finish fiscal year 2022 in excellent financial shape, thanks in large part to the stewardship of your chairman, Ron Swanson.",Mr.,"Chairman, would you like to say a few words?",I resign as chairman.,Effective immediately.,"Uh, would you like to explain why?",No.,Should we discuss your retirement package?,Just give me whatever the Board thinks is fair.,Agreed.,Best of luck.,"Don't get emotional, Vaughn.",You're embarrassing yourself.,What just happened?,"Ron, your family is beautiful.",They are a handsome bunch.,"Diane and I are especially proud, because Ivy was just accepted at Stanford University.",Wow.,Yeah?,It's going to cost an arm and a leg.,Did you take my advice?,I did.,Thank you again.,"I sold some of my gold, and officially diversified my portfolio.",Congratulations.,You now own 51% of the Lagavulin Distillery.,Pleasure doing business with you.,And with you.,Slinte.,Slinte.,"So, Ron, what brings you here?",I am at something of a personal crossroads.,Yes!,I love personal crossroads.,"I once made the mistake of not talking to you at such a moment, and I do not intend to repeat that error.","Well, let's take a walk.",There's a cute little park nearby.,"I suppose I had simply accomplished everything I wanted to, and there seemed to be little point in continuing.","So, what do you want to do now?","Well, that's the problem.",I am not sure.,My kids are growing up.,My days in an office feel like a waste.,I would like to turn my attention to something that would make me feel useful.,"But for the life of me, I cannot figure out what.","And there are not many people I mean, we were workplace proximity acquaintances for many years.","And so, I thought I thought, maybe Say no more, you big softie.",I'm going to spend every waking moment trying to figure this out for you.,You want to stay for dinner?,We're having steak.,Mmm.,But we're also hosting several members of the House Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs.,"I'll take that steak to go, please and thank you.","Hey, there you are.",Thanks for meeting me here.,"Well, if you'd held them here instead of that conference room, I would have come to more meetings.","I've got to tell you, Leslie.",Establishing this national park right next to Pawnee is quite an accomplishment.,This is a fine piece of land you saved.,"Thank you, Ron.",You want to run it?,"The superintendent of Bryce Canyon retired, and I convinced the superintendent of this park to transfer, shuffled a few things around The point is, someone needs to take care of this place now.",Thought it should be you.,"I Well, first of all, I would be working for the federal government Your job would be to walk around the land alone.",You'd live in the same town you've always lived in.,"You'd work outside, you'd talk to bears.",Next argument.,"Well, there must be dozens of people gunning for this job.",I wouldn't want you to ruffle any feathers.,Am I even qualified?,"Well, a few people might be annoyed.",But they'll get over it.,"And as far as your qualifications, you're Ron Swanson.",Stop being a dummy and accept.,When do I start?,"Oh, today.",I already accepted for you.,I still remember how to forge your signature.,Let's go meet your staff.,"Pawnee National Park Rangers, this is Ron Swanson, your new superintendent and boss.",Rangers.,My name is Ronald Ulysses Swanson.,"Your job, and mine, is to walk this land and make sure no one harms it.","If you show up on time, speak honestly, and treat everyone with fairness, we will get along just fine.","Though hopefully not too fine, as I am not looking for any new friends.",End of speech.,Well said.,"Thank you, Leslie.","You're welcome, Ron.",Okay.,Time to go to work.,"Laugh with me, buddy Jest with me, buddy Don't let her get the best of me, buddy Don't ever let me start feeling lonely Well, I have to make a couple more adjustments.","Babe, I don't want to seem dramatic, but I have just reconsidered every decision that we have made over the last year and I think we need to stay in Pawnee forever.",I know.,But we have to pick up the kids and we have a flight to catch.,But when is this group of people ever going to be all together again?,That's all I want.,All of these people in the same place at the same time.,It will happen.,Someday.,What's going to happen between now and then?,A lot.,And it's all going to be great.,You promise?,I promise.,This is a nice house.,You say that every time we're here.,"I'm just trying to distract you, so you don't have a nervous breakdown.",I think I am past that point.,You don't have to worry about me anymore.,"Hey, folks.",Welcome back.,Great to have so many good friends and colleagues.,We're looking forward to a great conversation and a good dinner.,"As usual, there is only one rule.",No shop talk.,"So, if you want to discuss politics, you're going to have to wait until after dinner.","I'm looking at you, Leslie.",Okay.,"Well, as long as we get to play charades later.",Okay.,"Last time we played charades, she spent three and a half hours here.",You're just mad because you lost.,"Oh, come on.","Damn, that food was good.",I've said it before and I'll say it again.,Joe Biden knows his way around a seafood risotto.,You've said that before?,"Anyway, the point is, yes, I do like working at Interior.",I love it.,But I'm always looking for new challenges.,Why do you ask?,There's a rumor the Governor of Indiana isn't going to run again.,And my friends at the DNC are very interested in you as a candidate.,For governor of Indiana?,Mmmhmm.,Someone's been reading my kindergarten dream journal.,"So, what do you think?",I'll call you next week and we can talk about it?,Oh.,Okay.,Great.,"Well, this is exciting.",I'm going to take this energy and I'm going to go crush Joe Biden in charades.,Dr.,Jill?,Let's pick teams.,Oh.,Move.,Need the congressman.,This is timesensitive.,"Hey, Jen, I didn't know you were here.",I'm everywhere.,You want to be governor of Indiana?,What?,Colquitt is not going to run again.,"It's a rumor for now, but my gut says it's for real.",You're the perfect candidate.,"Local hero, state government experience.","Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.","I mean, the only potential problem is that devastatingly nerdy Cones of Dunshire thing.","Uh, that's a problem?",Mmm.,"I'm sorry, but it's the ninthhighest selling multiplayer figurinebased strategy fantasy sequel game in history.",Please don't bail on me because of what just happened.,So I had a pretty interesting conversation with Janet from the DNC tonight.,"Oh, yeah?",Yeah.,"She said that Governor Colquitt might be stepping down, and the DNC thinks that I should run for governor.","Oh, God.",That kind of sucks.,Really?,Why?,"No, I mean, that's amazing.","It's just, Jen Barkley kind of approached me about running.",Oh!,Oh.,"Well, I mean, obviously Right.",Yeah.,"No, no.","I mean, obviously.",Yeah.,"I mean, obviously, we Okay.",Pros of you running for governor.,You would be a great governor.,We could make Pawnee our home base.,The kids could go to school in Pawnee.,And it would be a huge career move for you.,The pros of me running for governor are the same thing.,It's the same list.,Right.,The only con of you running would be that I don't get to run.,And vice versa.,Good.,"So, we've solved it.",Look.,We're going back to Pawnee in a week.,Why don't we just talk about it after that?,Good idea.,"Hey, maybe we can drop by the old stomping grounds.",See how the Parks Department has changed.,I love it.,Okay.,Are you ready?,"No, but we don't have a choice, do we?",Kids!,Dinner!,"Hey, I'm going to eat in my room because I have to study.",Can we go to Bobby's house to watch the game?,Have you finished your homework?,"Okay, don't forget  Bye, Dad.","Bye, Mom.",Bye.,Don't forget your ice skates.,You have a lesson tomorrow.,"Bye, Mom.","Bye, Dad.",Bye.,Want some broccoli?,Ugh!,No.,"You know, now that I'm here, it's giving me an idea about this governor thing.",Maybe we need fresh eyes.,"You know, other people to weigh in.",We should talk to Ron.,Or Tom.,Or April.,Or Donna.,"Or Andy, even.","Sometimes, he can be wise.","Yeah, good idea.",Let's call them.,Or you know what else we could do?,Just talk to them in person.,Surprise!,"Oh, wow.","It's what you wanted, right?","Everyone in the same room, at the same time.",I can't believe you.,We're all here together in the same room.,In this room.,I don't think I could be happier right now.,Want to bet?, Hi.," Oh, Ann's here.", Ann., Ann's here., Hey.," Hey, buddy.", How are you doing? Good.," You guys, Ann's here.", Should we move away from here? Yeah.," Yeah, this could go on for some time.", Aw.," Your hair looks amazing, by the way.", You look like a cartoon princess.," Oh, thank you.", It's from the pills I was telling you about.," I took some of those, but I don't know, they didn't do anything and they kind of upset my stomach."," No, you're supposed to crack them and leave them on your hair overnight.", Not eat them.," Oh, no."," Well, it's confusing, because they're delicious."," Because my first book was such a smash, I had to come up with a new angle for the follow-up."," Then, it hit me, Failure Failing to Fail.", Love it., How's everything? You properly treating yo' self out there in Seattle? In a manner of speaking., Joe and I spend most of our time on the foundation., I can't believe you went non-profit.," I mean, I love you, you're one of my best friends, but you have betrayed me and everything we stand for.", You've changed., Maybe you're right.," By the way, what time is it? Oh, it looks like it's half past spla-dow! What? I take it all back.", That's a lot of diamonds.," Gimme, gimme, gimme."," Hey, Oliver."," Hey, Leslie."," Hello, Ann."," Hi, April."," Your kids are, like, surprisingly awesome.", Thank you.," Did you use an egg donor, or give Chris a hall pass for a night? Once again, they are my biological children."," Once again, I don't believe you."," Ann, you rainbow-infused space unicorn."," Ann, you beautiful, sassy mannequin come to life."," Ann, you opalescent tree shark."," Leslie, you are the master of the metaphor.", Oh., I recently compared her to a nutrient-rich chia seed., What's that thing on your wrist? Oh! You are extremely healthy.," I do that literally Aren't you afraid that thing might give you cancer? Well, I am now."," Well, there he is.", Chip Traeger., You old son of a gun.," Andy, it's Chris.", Is it? Huh.," Hello, Jack.", Ron Swanson., Strong handshake.," Well done, you two.", Thank you.," So, are you going to have another one? Um Shh.", Shh.," 'Cause 'Cause he's sleeping? How can you tell? Oh, it's a common misconception that the Oculus holds all of the power.", It's actually the Lamplighter., Ann.," Oh, my God.", It's happening! It's totally happening., Our kids are falling in love., This is good.," Okay, remember."," If this is ever going to work, we have to pretend to disapprove.", Yeah., Right., Good call.," Hey! Leslie, no.", Oh.," Who cares? Ann Arbor, Michigan, is literally the greatest city that I have ever lived in.", But Pawnee is better.," So, we're moving back.", That's great., Yeah., I'm going to run admissions at Indiana., I'm trading Wolverines for Hoosiers.," Well, you're getting the better end of that deal.", Tom., I took the quiz in your book about what kind of person I am., I'm a Ron.," Ha! I'm usually a Tom, but sometimes, I'm a Donna."," Last time I took it, I was a Tom.", What? No.," No, no, no! Take it again.", I've got to go recalibrate the quiz.," So, did anyone have any insights on our ""running for governor"" situation? I've been so busy catching up with everyone, I haven't had a chance to ask them."," Yeah, me neither."," Okay, here's what I think.", I hate when we're on opposite sides., It stinks.," Plus, if one of us runs, it doesn't mean we're going to win.", Right., And it's not like this is the only career option for either of us.," So, all that matters is that we are good.", Right., Which is why I have an idea., I think we should flip a coin., I mean it., Let's literally flip a coin., Because whoever runs is going to do a great job.," And whoever doesn't run is going to be right alongside the other one, offering advice and support and whatever they need."," So, it doesn't matter.", So let's flip a coin., Okay.," You, Leslie Knope, the queen of planning and binders and pro and con lists.", You want to leave this to chance? Yes.," Because whatever's next, you and I are in it together."," So, let's go tell everybody."," And they can participate and they can sign the coin and then, you know, the coin will eventually make its way into the Smithsonian."," Okay, everybody, gather around! First of all, I just have to say that all of you in the same room at the same time with your children here, it's like It's the greatest thing that's ever happened in the history of America."," And secondly, Ben and I have an announcement.", Leslie is running for governor of Indiana.," What? Bully for you, Knope.", That's amazing.," Yeah, she got approached by the DNC and they think she has a great shot to win."," Indiana native, supremely qualified, and she wrote that she wanted to be governor in her kindergarten dream journal.", This makes sense.," So, I'm running for governor."," Ben is going to be running my campaign, because he's a super genius and he's got a tight, compact little body like an Italian sports car."," But right now, I'd like to make a toast."," When we worked here, together, we fought, scratched, and clawed to make people's lives a tiny bit better.", That's what public service is all about.," Small, incremental change, every day."," Teddy Roosevelt once said, ""Far and away, ""the best prize that life has to offer ""is a chance to work hard at work worth doing."," "" And I would add that what makes work worth doing is getting to do it with people that you love."," I started my career more than 30 years ago, in the Parks and Recreation Department right here in Pawnee, Indiana."," I've had a lot of different jobs, including two terms as your governor."," And soon, a new, unknown challenge awaits me."," Which, to me, even now, is thrilling, because I love the work.", Not to say that public service isn't sexy., Because it definitely is., But that's not why we do it.," We do it because we get the chance to work hard at work worth doing, alongside a team of people who we love."," So, I thank those people who have walked with me, and I thank you for this honor."," Now, go find your team, and get to work."," In addition to Governor Knope's honorary doctorate from the School of Public Policy, in recognition of all she has done for the people of Indiana, the campus library will henceforth bear her name."," A  library? Yeah, that should do it."," The swing is fixed! Well, there you have it, sir.", Another problem solved by the hard work of dedicated public servants.," Okay, great.", Bye.," Yeah, that's about right.", Okay., Well., Hang on.," Gayle made me promise to get a quick picture, just for old times' sake.", Good idea! Garry had a good idea., Ugh., The lighting is all wrong., I'm going to send you a glamor shot., Just photoshop me in later.," I'm not going to show up in that picture anyway, because I'm a vampire."," Hey, babe, for this picture, should I be Burt Macklin, Johnny Karate, or my new character, Sergeant Thunderfist, M.", D? Where did you get that? Found it in the sandbox., Ew., Go Macklin., Macklin's the hottest., Get on with it., I can't hold this smile forever., I look ridiculous.," Okay, hang on.", Okay.," You ready, babe? Yes.", I'm ready., That is a series wrap on Parks and Recreation.,   ,"
