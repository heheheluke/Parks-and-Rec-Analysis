**A few notes on the transcription of the show:**

- While there are formally 125 episodes, the transcription will only show 122 episodes; this is because a few episodes are actually split into part 1 and part 2, and are intended to be viewed as an hour-long episode (and appear on Netflix as one episode). Thus, the episode numbers may be slightly inconsistent with, for example, the Wikipedia list of Parks and Rec episodes. The combined episodes are: _London (S6E1)_, _Moving Up (S6E20)_, and _One Last Ride (S7E12)_. Thus, the "Season" and "Episode" fields for lines may not be consistent with the Wikipedia page for Parks and Rec.

- There are no accents or special characters, e.g. "creme brulee" or "Beyonce" (full disclosure, I didn't actually know Beyonce had an accent on the last e). This shouldn't be a problem, as foreign-borrowed words that utilize accents don't tend to overlap with English words when the special accents are removed.

- There are very few fully non-English lines (besides some ones like "Gracias"). Part of this is because I don't speak those languages, and part of it is because Netflix's subtitles just write "[speaks Spanish]" and not the actual words. This is mostly relevant for April,  who speaks some Spanish in a few episodes (most prominently in the Sister City episode and the short time that Eduardo the boyfriend is a thing).

- The lines may be inconsistently split up as separate entries, e.g. sometimes an entry will have just one sentence (or one word), and sometimes it'll have multiple lines. As an example, "Who's 'we'? What are you-- Oh, God." is one entry, but "What?" "Why?" may be split up into two entries. The character assigned to multiple-lines-as-a-single-entry is still correct (e.g. Ann did say all those lines consecutively in the former example), it just mostly just depended on how lazy I felt to separate the sentences when going though the transcript at the time. Just a warning for those possibly intending to use "number of lines" or "number of entries" as some sort of metric.

- There are some empty lines that may be assigned to the season and episode that follows before them. There are also lines separating episodes, where the "Character" field is empty and the "Line" is something like "Season: 3, Episode 04". These made it easier to transcribe by hand. These are easy to detect; just check that "Season: " and "Episode: " are in the line, as no other lines contain both.

- Sometimes the lesser-known characters (e.g. the random citizens of Pawnee you find at the town halls) are credited as "Extra" or "Extras," and sometimes as their real name. I've tried my best to identify them when they appear, but not all of their lines may be credited to them. I probably could go back and fix it, but it's not really hyper-important for what I'm using the transcription for. The more prominent recurring characters, like Perd Hapley, Joan Callamezzo, and the Saperstein siblings should all be credited correctly.

- The names of the characters are based on the [Parks and Recreation Wiki](https://parksandrecreation.fandom.com/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation), unless a spoken line that mentions the character directly contradicts it. Again, not super relevant, as it won't affect the main characters or even the more prominent recurring characters, it mostly applies to the people that appear for one episode.

- Garry Gergich's name is still "Jerry Gergich" in the transcript. My bad. I'll fix that eventually. Although I do find it appropriate for the character in the context of the show, so maybe I'll leave it. So for now, as an official justification: for a majority of the show, he is referred to as Jerry, so it made it easy to transcribe.
